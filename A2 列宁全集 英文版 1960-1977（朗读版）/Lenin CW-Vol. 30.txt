 PREFACE Volume Thirty contains Lenin’s speeches and writings for the period between September 1919 and April 1920—theperiod when foreign armed intervention and the Civil Warhad reached their peak and were followed by a temporarylull after the defeat of Kolchak and Denikin. 
 These speeches and articles demonstrate the great variety of the work done by Lenin in guiding the activities of theBolshevik Party and the Soviet state. 
 Most of the speeches, reports and articles deal with ques-tions of the defence of the socialist fatherland, the organisa-tion of the Soviet state and the consolidation of the ranks of the Bolshevik Party. 
 A considerable part of the volume, however, consists of Lenin’s speeches at non-party conferencesof workers and Red Army soldiers, at congresses of the tradeunions of water transport workers, miners and textile work-ers, and at a congress of working Cossacks. 
 These arespeeches addressed to the people, in which Lenin appealed for the greater unity of the people at home and the army at the front, for support for the Red Army and for activeparticipation in the work of restoring the economy and inthe government of the country. 
 Lenin’s writings inculcatedupon the masses a spirit of staunchness, heroism, self-sacrifice and iron discipline, and infused in them faith in their own strength and in victory. 
 In several of the articles in this volume Lenin develops the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat as aninstrument for the organisation of socialist society. 
 Lenincompares Soviet democracy to false, bourgeois democracy;he exposes the West-European socialists, the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries as traitors to socialism and lackeys of imperialism for defending the dictatorship of theimperialist bourgeoisie under the flag of “pure democracy”. 
 This is the subject-matter of the articles “The Dictatorship of the Proletariat”, “Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat”, “The Constituent Assembly Elections and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat”,“A Publicist’s Notes” and others. 
 In his “Letter to the Workers and Peasants of the Ukraine Apropos of the Victories over Denikin”, “To the Communistsof Turkestan”, “Address to the Second All-Russia Congress of Communist Organisations of the Peoples of the East, November 22, 1919”, and the “Draft Resolution of the C. 
C. 
,R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on Soviet Rule in the Ukraine”, Lenin explainsthe nature of the nationalities policy of the Soviet govern-ment and stresses the point that victory over the foreignmilitary interventionists and internal counter-revolution is possible only if the formerly oppressed peoples rally around the Russian people. 
 In his “Speech Delivered at the First Congress of Agri-cultural Communes and Agricultural Artels, December 4,1919” and his “Report on Subbotniks Delivered to a MoscowCity Conference of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
), December 20, 1919”, and in his article “From the Destruction of the Old Social System to the Creation of the New” Lenin deals with questions ofthe socialist reconstruction of the country, the creation ofnew, socialist forms of labour in industry and agriculture. 
The “Report on the Work of the All-Russia Central ExecutiveCommittee and the Council of People’s Commissars Deliv-ered at the First Session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, Seventh Convocation, February 2, 1920” wasfirst published in full in the Fourth (Russian) Edition of theCollected Works ; in this report Lenin gave his reasons why a plan for the electrification of Russia had to be prepared. 
 The items contained in the present volume include con-siderable material on questions of the organisation of eco-nomic management, the increasing of the proportion ofworkers in the state apparatus, the participation of tradeunions in economic development and the struggle againstbureaucratic methods. 
 In his “Letter to R. 
C. 
P. 
 Organisationson Preparations for the Party Congress” and his reports and speeches delivered at the Ninth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
), the Third All-Russia Congress of Trade Unionsand others, Lenin took a stand on the necessity for one-man management, an improvement in labour discipline and en-hanced responsibility of the individual in the management of industrial enterprises. 
 Lenin dealt a serious rebuff to the supporters of the anti-Party “democratic centralism” groupwhose policy would have led to irresponsibility in industrialmanagement. 
 In his speech on “The Tasks of the Working Women’s Movement in the Soviet Republic” and the articles “Soviet Power and the Status of Women”, “To the Working Women” and “International Working Women’s Day” Lenin shows thehard position of the woman and her lack of rights undercapitalism and explains how much Soviet power has given towomen; he calls upon women to take an active part in theeconomic, social and political life of the country. 
 In the articles “How the Bourgeoisie Utilises Renegades” and “Greetings to Italian, French and German Communists”,and in the “Draft (or Theses) of the R. 
C. 
P. 
’s Reply to theLetter of the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Ger-many” Lenin, as the leader of the world working-class move-ment, gives guidance to the Communist Parties in the spirit of loyalty to the principles of the dictatorship of the proletar-iat and proletarian internationalism, mustering the bestof the revolutionary proletariat around the Communist Inter-national. 
 Fourteen documents included in the present volume were published for the first time in the Fourth (Russian) Edition of the Collected Works . 
 The group of documents containing answers to corres-pondents of the newspapers The Chicago Daily News and Daily Express , and of the Universal Service deal mainly with questions of the foreign policy of Soviet power. 
 In his repliesLenin stressed the consistent desire of Soviet Russia for peace and the establishment of commercial relations with all capitalist countries; he also exposed the imperialists as war-mongers. 
 Two speeches appeared for the first time in an edition of the Collected Works in the Fourth (Russian) Edition from which this translation has been made—the “Speech at a Meeting in Presnya District on the Anniversary of the December Uprising, 1905, December 19, 1919”, and the “Speech atthe Third All-Russia Conference of Directors of Adult Education Divisions of Gubernia Education Departments, February 25, 1920”; new also are the letter of greetings “To the Bureau of the Women’s Congress in Petrograd Gubernia” and the “Draft Decisions and Directives on Co-operatives”. 
 In the letter “To the Communist Comrades Who Belonged to the United ‘Communist Party of Germany’ and Have NowFormed a New Party” and in the unfinished article “On Com-promises” Lenin makes some statements on the tactics of the fraternal Communist Parties.

 LENIN 19/FL00340 SPEEC H AT A NON-PART Y CONFERENCE OF THE WORKER S AND MEN OF THE RED ARMY OF BASMANNY , LEFORTOVO , ALEXEYEVSKOY E AND SOKOLNIKI DISTRICT S1 SEPTEMBER 3, 1919 Comrades, permit me to greet your non-party conference of workers and men of the Red Army, together with Red Commanders graduating from the artillery courses. 
 This conference has been called to discuss problems of strengthening our state system and our state machinery. 
 In all countries the working-class masses are oppressed. 
 They do not enjoy the benefits of capitalist civilisation,although the working people should by rights constitute thebasis of all state life. 
 In our country, comrades, the working people are the basis, the foundation of the Soviet Republic. 
 After the triumph of the working people in February 1917,Soviets made their appearance throughout Russia. 
 The ideaof the Soviets did not originate in 1917 for they were bornas far back as 1905. 
 Even then Soviets of Workers’ Deputiesexisted. 
 After the October Revolution Soviet power met with the sympathy of workers in all countries, something that can be explained by profound internal causes. 
 Allow me, comrades, to say something about the main principles of political life in Soviet Russia. 
 I am not inpossession of exact material demonstrating the economicsituation of our Republic; other speakers will no doubt deal with this, especially with the food policy of the workers’ and peasants’ government; I shall deal only with the politi-cal aspect. 
 To get a better picture of the basic principle of Soviet power we must take a backward glance, we must examine the course taken by our revolution, beginning from 1917. 
 There were two periods in our revolution—one was the period ofthe Kerensky policy and the Kornilov revolt that precededSoviet power, the other was the period of Kaledin, Kolchakand Denikin 2 who tried to destroy Soviet power. 
 Non-party workers, members of the working classes, must ask themselves why these two periods occurred and why they are intercon-nected. 
 Comrades, every worker, every man of the Red Army, every member of the working classes must give thought to thereason our Soviet power is accused of terrorism, why it issaid that the Bolsheviks are dictators, that the Bolsheviks are cut-throats. 
 On the other hand, every member of the work-ing classes should ask himself why the power of Kerensky,Kaledin and Kolchak collapsed so easily. 
 You all know thatat the time Kerensky was in power, Russia was covered witha network of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, andthat side by side with them, the bourgeoisie held all power in their own hands. 
 The bourgeoisie were supported by the Al-lies, who wanted Russia to continue the war; the Russianbourgeoisie, too, wanted to continue the war in order to gethold of the Dardanelles. 
 That is why Kerensky’s bourgeoisgovernment, supported by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, did not want to and could not publish the treaties concluded between the government of Nicholas the Bloody and the Allies. 
 In this way the bourgeoisie, by a fraudand with the aid of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, maintained their power over the masses ofthe working people. 
 You all remember that there were very few Bolsheviks in the Soviets at the beginning of the 1917 revolution. 
 I remem-ber that at the time of the First Congress of Soviets in June,the Bolsheviks did not make up even a seventh part of thedelegates. 
 The bourgeoisie and the so-called socialist partiesof Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries said of us thatthe Bolsheviks might have a corrupting influence on the masses. 
 But what was Kerensky’s bourgeois government doing at this time? They were feeding the working peoplewith promises that were never fulfilled. 
 The land law was never promulgated. 
 But when the land committees tried to take over the landed estates for distribution among the poor peasants, the committees were arrested. 
 It became obvious to the working people that this government would give themnothing. 
 They began to realise that only their own power,the power of the workers and poor peasants, would give themanything. 
 It was at this time that Kornilov launched his attack on Petrograd. 
 It was not something casual, it derived from the fraudulent policy of Kerensky’s government that had allthe time tried to reconcile landowners and peasants, workingpeople and exploiters, labour and capital. 
 And then the land-owners, officers and capitalists wanted to take all power intotheir own hands. 
 That is why the Kornilov revolt broke out. 
 The Soviets realised the danger and mustered their forces against Kornilov. 
 And when Kerensky’s bourgeois govern-ment continued its policy of deception even after this, theworkers soon became more politically conscious and at thesame time the number of Bolsheviks in the Soviets beganrapidly to increase, even before the October Revolution. 
 When we took power into our hands in October, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who strutted freelyaround Smolny, 3 warned us threateningly that the front would move up and wipe us off the face of the earth. 
 We laughedin their faces in reply because we knew that the workingpeople would understand our explanations, that they sup-ported the power of the working people and, consequently, the power of the Soviets. 
 And so it was; when numerous dele-gations came to Petrograd from the front we explained tothem the real state of affairs and they all came over to ourside. 
 That is an object lesson for you non-party workingpeople. 
 Everyone who works, every factory worker, every man of the Red Army, must learn a lesson from the history of the Kerensky government, who, I repeat, wanted toreconcile the interests of the landowners and peasants,workers and employers, labour and capital. 
 It seemed that the Kerensky government ought to have been a strong one because the Allied bourgeois governments promised to support it, nevertheless it collapsed. 
 The Kerensky government collapsed because it was founded ondeception and had no ground under its feet. 
 The Kerensky government promised the working people universal elections, but only to cast dust in their eyes and distract their attention from the real state of affairs. 
 For this reason, when the proletariat took power into its own hands after the OctoberRevolution, it immediately organised its own govern-ment bodies, the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’Deputies. 
 The workers’ and peasants’ government straightaway rejected the false policy of Kerensky’s bourgeois government. 
 The first act of the Council of People’s Commissars was thepublication of the secret treaties concluded between thegovernment of Nicholas the Bloody and our former Allies. 
The workers’ and peasants’ government declared forthrightlythat they did not want to carry on a war waged in the inter-ests of the bourgeoisie, and notwithstanding all the slander by the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary hirelings ofthe bourgeoisie, proposed to all belligerent countries thatthey commence peace negotiations. 
 The workers of all count-ries then saw that Soviet power did not wish to continue thewar. 
 The rapacious Treaty of Brest 4 was concluded, the treaty that the German predators imposed on unarmed Russia. 
 Sympathy for Soviet power spread and grew strong among theclass-conscious working-class masses of all countries. 
 Whenthe bourgeois governments of the countries of the Entente 5 forced the German plunderers to conclude a still more harshand rapacious treaty, 6 the workers of all countries realised that they had been fooled all the time. 
 Voices were raised and grew in strength and number against those who had allthe time been fooling the people. 
 Workers began to demandSoviet power, the power of the working people, the power ofthe workers and peasants. 
 That is why the bourgeois governments of Kerensky and Kolchak, that were supported by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, collapsed so rapidly. 
 (You all knowthat the Menshevik Maisky was a member of the SiberianGovernment. 
 7) And the Mensheviks, and the Socialist-Revo-lutionaries, and the Czechoslovaks,8 supported by the foreign bourgeoisie, all joined forces, at first against the Bol-sheviks, and then to organise a national democratic govern-ment. 
 But what do we see? Kolchak-type officers disbandedthe Constituent Assembly in Siberia and established the power of the officers, capitalists and landowners. 
 Thus the working people of Siberia learned from their own experience that they were being deceived, and that is why the Red Army was able to capture the whole of Siberia so easily and in sucha short time—the Siberian workers and peasants came to theaid of the Red Army. 
 Comrades, now we have to give some thought to why it is said that the Bolsheviks use force, that the Bolsheviks are dictators. 
 Why is it that all those who followed the Men-sheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries, Czechoslovaks and Kol-chak soon turned their backs on them? Why did the land-owners, capitalists and officers from the Siberian Governmentexpel the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries and putKolchak in their place immediately they got power into their own hands? Why did that government, supported from all sides, collapse so quickly? Because all their words and alltheir deeds were false and fraudulent. 
 Because they did notkeep their word, did not give the people a constituent assem-bly, or popular government, or any other kind of democraticgovernment; they established a dictatorship of the land-owners and officers. 
 Comrades, the bourgeoisie, by force of its class interests, had to lie to the working people and deceive them. 
 The work-ers and peasants understand all this. 
 They realise that therewill be no lies and no deception only when power is in thehands of the working people; nor will there be any of the horrors the proletariat and poor peasantry had to put up with and still have to put up with after four years of war duringwhich the bourgeoisie were in power. 
 The proletariat hasrealised that there is only one way out—to overthrow thepower of the capitalists; that there can be no reconciliationbetween labour and capital such as the Mensheviks and Social-ist-Revolutionaries are always talking about. 
 The Siberian workers and peasants have paid a truly high price—tens ofthousands of people shot and flogged to death—for theirgullibility. 
 We have had the sad experience of the blood ofSiberian workers and peasants being spilled, but we knowthat it will be a lesson to them. 
 Experience of this kind is the best way of teaching Bolshevism to the workers and peasants. 
 After it the working people realise that there isno middle way, that they must choose—either the power of the workers and peasants, Soviet power, or the power of the landowners and capitalists. 
 The bourgeoisie are trying to stultify the consciousness of the working people by force and by deception, but all their efforts will collapse like a houseof cards as the political consciousness of the workers and thepoor peasants grows. 
 The venture of Denikin, who, in the Ukraine is repeating the Kolchak lesson, will compel the Ukrainian workers and peasants to understand the mistake they are making in not fighting vigorously enough against him. 
 We know thatafter Denikin has ruled for a while in the Ukraine, the Uk-rainian workers and peasants will be all the stronger for it andwill defend the power of the workers and peasants, not inwords but in deeds, as our Siberian brothers are now doing. 
 The workers’ and peasants’ government tells the peasants and all working people, “Come with us, build your own pro-letarian state. 
 Take a look at the lesson taught by Kolchakand Denikin and you will see the sort of life you get whenthere is no Soviet power. 
” That lesson is the best agitationon our behalf. 
 The powerful workers’ and peasants’ government suppresses whiteguard conspiracies conjured up against it. 
 It sweepsthe traitors out of its ranks with an iron broom. 
 The workers’and peasants’ government organised the Red Army, putspecialists into it and surrounded them with a number ofcommunist commissars. 
 Dozens of specialists who proved to be traitors have been kicked out of the Red Army, and thous-ands, tens of thousands of them are honestly carrying outtheir duties and remain in the ranks of the workers’ and peas-ants’ Red Army. 
 That is the main, basic lesson to be learnedfrom the political emancipation and liberation of the workingpeople. 
 Everything that I am telling you today, comrades, is be-coming clear to the working people of other countries. 
 Every-where the movement of the workers who demand the estab-lishment of Soviet power is growing and expanding. 
 Youknow that Mensheviks now head the government in Germanyand that they are maintained in power by the armed force of the Entente; nevertheless, despite this, the German workers are demanding Soviet power. 
 And the German Governmentwas recently forced to add a clause to its constitution intro-ducing Soviets or Councils of workers’ deputies throughout Germany. 
 Those councils, however, do not possess the right to discuss questions of the country’s political life. 
 According to the constitution of the socialist-traitors the GermanSoviets have the right to discuss only the economic situationin the country. 
 We get very little information on other West-European countries, because we are surrounded by enemies onall sides, but the information that does reach us speaks of the spread and strengthening of the movement in favour of the Bolsheviks. 
 Let me tell you of a little incident that occurredin France and which proves more eloquently than any wordsthe correctness of my arguments; it will tell you a great deal. 
Two Bolshevik newspapers are published in France. 
 One ofthem wanted to have the title of Bolshevik but the censor (in democratic France there is a censor!) forbade it and the newspaper called itself Le Titre censuré . 
 9 Workers who buy the newspaper and see the title add the word Bolshevik themselves. 
 ( Stormy applause . 
) In conclusion, comrades, let me tell you of a report I received today from Comrade Zinoviev, Chairman of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Red Army Deputies. 
 Comrade Zinoviev informs me that a hundred Estonian prison-ers have been landed in Petrograd and they told him the fol-lowing. 
 A non-party conference of trade union workers washeld in whiteguard Estonia. 
 It was attended by 417 delegatesof whom only 33 were Mensheviks, all the others being Bolsheviks! ( Stormy applause . 
) The conference demanded the conclusion of peace with Russia. 
 When the Britishlearned of this their representative appeared at the conferenceand proposed the overthrow of the whiteguard Government ofEstonia, but the workers answered by chasing him away anddemanding the conclusion of peace with Russia and the re-turn to peaceful life. 
 The conference was then dispersed and a hundred people were sent to Russia “to seek Bolshevism”;they have arrested 26 people and intend to shoot them. 
 Weresponded to this act of whiteguard Estonia by a manifesto tothe workers and the population of the country, and weinformed their government that we shall shoot all hostages in our hands. 
 10 (Applause . 
) And there, too, the government was supported by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolution-aries! Little Estonia, at her non-party trade union conference, gave powerful Britain a proper answer—Britain that had menaced us with an alliance of fourteen powers. 
11 As I come to the end of my speech, allow me to express my confidence that Soviet Russia, for two years victoriousinside the country, will soon conquer the power of the bour-geoisie throughout the world. 
 ( Stormy applause. 
 ) Pravda No. 
 201, Published according to September 11, 1919 the Pravda text HOW THE BOURGEOISIE UTILISES RENEGADES Our wireless stations intercept messages from Carnarvon (Britain), Paris and other European centres. 
 Today Paris isthe centre of the world imperialist alliance and its wireless messages are therefore often of particular interest. 
 A few days ago, on September 13, the government wireless station inthis centre of world imperialism reported the publication ofa new anti-Bolshevik book by Karl Kautsky, the well-knownrenegade and leader of the Second International. 
 The millionaires and multimillionaires would not use their government wireless station for nothing. 
 They considered it necessary to publicise Kautsky’s new crusade. 
 In theirattempt to stem the advancing tide of Bolshevism they haveto grasp at everything—even at a straw, even at Kautsky’sbook. 
 Our heartfelt thanks to the French millionaires forhelping Bolshevik propaganda so splendidly, for helping us by making a laughing-stock of Kautsky’s philistine anti-Bolshevism. 
 Today, September 18, I received the September 7 issue of Vorwärts , the newspaper of the German social-chauvinists, the murderers of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. 
 Ithas an article by Friedrich Stampfer on Kautsky’s new book (Terrorism and Communism ) and cites a number of passages from it. 
 12 When we compare Stampfer’s article and the Paris wireless message we see that the latter is in all probabilitybased on the former. 
 Kautsky’s book is extolled by the Schei-demanns 13 and Noskes, the bodyguards of the German bour eoisie and murderers of the German Communists, by those who have joined the imperialists of the Entente in fighting international communism. 
 A highly edifying spectacle! Andwhen I called Kautsky a lackey of the bourgeoisie (in my book The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky ), our Mensheviks, those typical representatives of the Berne (yellow) International,14 could not find words strong enough to express their indignation. 
 But it is a fact, gentlemen, despite all your indignation. 
 The Scheidemanns of Vorwärts and the Entente millionaires are certainly not in collusion with me when they praiseKautsky and hold him up as a weapon in the struggle against world Bolshevism. 
 In relation to the bourgeoisie Kautsky— ven if he did not realise and did not wish it—has provedto be exactly what I described him to be. 
 Some of the more “thunderous” of his accusations against the Bolsheviks will show how far he has gone in his apostasyfrom socialism and the revolution, apostasy that hides behind the name of Marxism. 
 “Kautsky describes in detail,” Stampfer writes, “how the Bol-sheviks always, in the end, arrive at the very opposite of theiravowed aims: they were opposed to the death sentence, but are nowresorting to mass shootings.... 
” First, it is a downright lie to say that the Bolsheviks were opposed to the death sentence in time of revolution. 
 At the Party’s Second Congress in 1903, when Bolshevism firstemerged, it was suggested that abolition of the death sentencebe made one of the demands in the Party programme thenbeing drawn up, but the minutes record that this only gaverise to the sarcastic question: “For Nicholas II too?” Even the Mensheviks, in 1903, did not venture to call for a vote on the proposal to abolish the death sentence for the tsar. 
And in 1917, at the time of the Kerensky government, I wrotein Pravda that no revolutionary government could dispense with the death sentence; the question was against which classa particular government would use it. 
 Kautsky has so far forgotten how to think in terms of revolution and is so steeped in philistine opportunism that he cannot visualise aproletarian revolutionary party openly acknowledging, longbefore its victory, the need for capital punishment in rela-tion to counter-revolutionaries. 
 “Honest” Kautsky, being anhonest man and an honest opportunist, quite unashamedly writes untruths about his opponents. 
 Secondly, anyone with the least understanding of revolu-tion will realise that here we are not discussing revolution in general, but a revolution that is developing out of the great imperialist slaughter of the peoples. 
 Can one conceive of a proletarian revolution that develops from such a war being free of counter-revolutionary conspiracies and attacksby hundreds of thousands of officers belonging to the land-owner and capitalist classes? Can one conceive of a working-class revolutionary party that would not make death thepenalty for such attacks in the midst of an extremely cruel civil war, with the bourgeoisie conspiring to bring in foreign troops in an attempt to overthrow workers’ government?Everyone, save hopeless and ludicrous pedants, must give anegative answer to these questions. 
 But Kautsky is no longerable to see issues in their concrete historical setting in theway he formerly did. 
 Thirdly. 
 If Kautsky is no longer capable of analysis and writes lies about the Bolsheviks, if he cannot think, oreven present the problem of distinctive features of a revolu-tion arising out of four years of war—he could at least takea closer look at what is going on around him. 
 What is provedby the assassination of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg by army officers in the democratic republic of Germany? What is proved by the escape from prison of these officers,who were given preposterously lenient sentences? Herr Kaut-sky and his whole “independent” party (independent of theproletariat but very much dependent on petty-bourgeoisprejudices) evade these issues and resort to snivelling con-demnation and philistine lamentations. 
 That is precisely why more and more revolutionary workers the world overare turning away from the Kautskys, Longuets, MacDonaldsand Turatis and joining the Communists, for the revolution-ary proletariat needs victory over counter-revolution, not impotent “condemnation” of it. 
 Fourthly. 
 The question of “terrorism” is, apparently, basic to Kautsky’s book. 
 That is evident from the title, alsofrom Stampfer’s remark that “Kautsky is doubtlessly right inasserting that the fundamental principle of the Commune wasnot terrorism, but universal suffrage”. 
 In my Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky I cited ample evidence to show that all this talk of a “fundamental principle” is a sheer travesty of Marxism. 
 My purpose here is a differentone. 
 To show what Kautsky’s disquisitions on the subject of “terrorism” are worth, whom, which class , they serve , I shall cite in full a short article by a liberal writer. 
 It is a letter to The New Republic (June 25, 1919), a liberal Americ-an journal which, generally speaking, expresses the petty-bourgeois viewpoint. 
 However, it is preferable to Kautsky’sin not presenting that viewpoint either as revolutionarysocialism or Marxism. 
 This is the full text of the letter: MANNERHEIM AND KOLCHAK Sir: The Allied governments have refused to recognise the Soviet Government of Russia because, as they state: 1. 
 The Soviet Government is—or was—pro-German. 
 2. 
 The Soviet Government is based on terrorism. 
3. 
 The Soviet Government is undemocratic and unrepresentative of the Russian people. 
 Meanwhile the Allied governments have long since recognised the present whiteguard Government of Finland under the dictatorship ofGeneral Mannerheim, although it appears: 1. 
 That German troops aided the whiteguards in crushing the Social-ist Republic of Finland, and that General Mannerheim sent repeatedtelegrams of sympathy and esteem to the Kaiser. 
 Meanwhile the Soviet Government was busily undermining the German Government with propaganda among troops on the Russian front. 
 The Finnish Govern-ment was infinitely more pro-German than the Russian. 
 2. 
 That the present Government of Finland on coming into power executed in cold blood within a few days’ time 16,700 members of theold Socialist Republic, and imprisoned in starvation camps 70,000 more. 
 Meanwhile the total executions in Russia for the year ended Novem-ber 1, 1918, were officially stated to have been 3,800, including manycorrupt Soviet of officials as well as counter-revolutionists. 
 The FinnishGovernment was infinitely more terroristic than the Russian. 
 3. 
 That after killing and imprisoning nearly 90,000 socialists, and driving some 50,000 more over the border into Russia—and Finland is a small country with an electorate of only about 400,000—the white-guard government deemed it sufficiently safe to hold elections. 
 In spiteof all precautions, a majority of socialists were elected, but GeneralMannerheim, like the Allies after the Vladivostok elections, allowednot one of them to be seated. 
 Meanwhile the Soviet Government haddisenfranchised all those who do no useful work for a living. 
 The Finn-ish Government was considerably less democratic than the Russian. 
 And much the same story might be rehearsed in respect to that great champion of democracy and the new order, Admiral Kolchak ofOmsk, whom the Allied governments have supported, supplied andequipped, and are now on the point of officially recognising. 
 Thus every argument that the Allies have urged against the recog-nition of the Soviets, can be applied with more strength and honesty against Mannerheim and Kolchak. 
 Yet the latter are recognised, and the blockade draws ever tighter about starving Russia. 
 Stuart Chase Washington, D. 
C. 
 This letter written by a bourgeois liberal, effectively ex-poses all the vileness of the Kautskys, Martovs, Chernovs,Brantings and other heroes of the Berne yellow International and their betrayal of socialism. 
 For, first, Kautsky and all these heroes lie about Soviet Russia on the question of terrorism and democracy. 
 Secondly,they do not assess developments from the standpoint of theclass struggle as it is actually developing on a world scaleand in the sharpest possible form, but from the standpoint of a petty-bourgeois, philistine longing for what might have been if there had been no close link between bourgeois democ-racy and capitalism, if there were no whiteguards in theworld, if they had not been supported by the world bourgeoisie,and so on and so forth. 
 Thirdly, a comparison of thisAmerican letter with the writings of Kautsky and Co. 
 will clearly show that Kautsky’s objective role is servility to the bourgeoisie. 
 The world bourgeoisie supports the Mannerheims and Kol-chaks in an attempt to stifle Soviet power, alleging that it isterrorist and undemocratic. 
 Such are the facts. 
 And Kaut-sky, Martov, Chernov and Co. 
 are only singing songs about terrorism and democracy in chorus with the bourgeoisie, for the world bourgeoisie is singing this song to deceivethe workers and strangle the workers’ revolution. 
 The person-al honesty of “socialists” who sing the same song “sincerely”,i. 
e. 
, because they are extremely dull-witted, does not inany way alter the objective role played by the song. 
 The “hon-est opportunists”, the Kautskys, Martovs, Longuets and Co. 
, have become “honest” (in their unprecedented spineless-ness) counter-revolutionaries . 
 Such are the facts. 
An American liberal realises—not because he is theoretically equipped to do so, but simply because he is an attentive observer of developments in a sufficiently broad light, on a world scale—that the world bourgeoisie has organised and is waging a civil war against the revolutionary proletariat and, accordingly, is supporting Kolchak and Denikin in Russia, Mannerheim in Finland, the Georgian Mensheviks, those lackeys of the bourgeoisie, in the Caucasus, the Polish imperialists and Polish Kerenskys in Poland, the Scheide-manns in Germany, the counter-revolutionaries (Mensheviksand capitalists) in Hungary, etc. 
, etc. 
 But Kautsky, like the inveterate reactionary philistine he is, continues snivelling about the fears and horrors of civil war! All semblance of revolutionary understanding, and all semblance of historical realism (for it is high time theinevitability of imperialist war being turned into civil warwere realised) have disappeared. 
 This is, furthermore, di-rectly abetting the bourgeoisie, it is helping them, and Kaut-sky is actually on the side of the bourgeoisie in the civil war that is being waged, or is obviously being prepared, through-out the world. 
 His shouting, groaning, weeping and hysteria about the civil war serve to cover up his dismal failure as a theoretician. 
For the Bolsheviks have proved to be right; in the autumnof 1914 they declared to the world that the imperialist war would be transformed into civil war . 
 Reactionaries of every shade were indignant or laughed; but the Bolsheviks wereright . 
 To conceal their complete failure, their stupidity and short-sightedness, the reactionaries must try to scare thepetty bourgeoisie by showing them the horrors of civilwar. 
 That is just what Kautsky as a politician is doing. 
 To what absurd lengths he has gone can be seen from the following. 
 There is no hope of a world revolution, Kautskyasserts—and what do you think he used as an argument?A revolution in Europe an the Russian pattern would mean“unleashing (Entfessellung ) civil war throughout the world for a whole generation ”, and moreover not simply unleashing a veritable class war, but a “ fratricidal war among the pro-letarians ”. 
 The italicised words belong to Kautsky and are— admiringly of course—quoted by Stampfer. 
 Yes, Scheidemann’s scoundrels and hangmen have good reason to admire them! Here is a “socialist leader” scaringpeople with the spectre of revolution and scaring them away from revolution! But, curiously enough, there is one thing Kautsky overlooks; for nearly two years the all-powerful Entente has been fighting against Russia and thereby stirring up revolution in the Entente countries. 
 If the revo-lution were even to begin now, even if only in its compromis-ing stage and in only one or two of the Entente Great Powers this would immediately put an end to the civil war in Russia, would immediately liberate hundreds of millions in the colo-nies, where resentment is at boiling-point and is kept incheck only by the violence of the European powers. 
 Kautsky now obviously has another motive for his actions in addition to the foulness of his servile soul that he demon-strated throughout the imperialist war—he is afraid of pro-tracted civil war in Russia. 
 And fear prevents him from see-ing that the bourgeoisie of the whole world is fighting Russia. 
 A revolution in one or two of the European Great Powerswould completely undermine the rule of the world bourgeoi-sie, destroy the very foundations of its domination and leave it no safe haven anywhere . 
 The two-year war of the world bourgeoisie against Russia’s revolutionary proletariat actually encourages revolution-aries everywhere, for it proves that victory on a world scale is very near and easy. 
 As far as civil war “among the proletarians” is concerned, we have heard that argument from the Chernovs and Mar-tovs. 
 To assess its utter dishonesty, let us take a simpleexample. 
 During the great French Revolution, part of thepeasants, the Vendée peasants, fought for the King against theRepublic. 
 In June 1848 and May 1871 part of the workers served in the armies of Cavaignac and Galliffet, the armies that stifled the revolution. 
 What would you say of a manwho took this line of argument: I regret the “civil war among the peasants in France in 1792 and among the workers in 1848 and 1871”? You would have to say that he was a hypocriteand defender of reaction, the monarchy and the Cavaignacs. 
 And you would be right. 
 Today only a hopeless idiot could fail to understand that what has taken place in Russia (and is beginning or maturingin the rest of the world) is a civil war of the proletariatagainst the bourgeoisie . 
 There never has been, and never can be, a class struggle in which part of the advanced class does not remain on the side of the reactionary forces. 
 That applies to civil war too. 
 Part of the backward workers are boundto help the bourgeoisie—for a longer or shorter period. 
 But only scoundrels can use that to justify their desertion to the bourgeoisie. 
 Theoretically, this is a refusal to understand what the facts of the development of the world labour movement havebeen screaming and shouting about since 1914. 
 The break-away of the top strata of the working class, corrupted by a middle-class way of life and opportunism and bribed by “soft jobs” and other bourgeois sops, began to take shape on a world scale in the autumn of 1914 and reached its full devel-opment between 1915 and 1918. 
 By disregarding this histor-ical fact and blaming the Communists for the split in themovement, Kautsky is only demonstrating, for the thous-andth time, his role of lackey of the bourgeoisie. 
 For forty years, from 1852 to 1892, Marx and Engels spoke of part (i. 
e. 
, the top strata, the leaders, the “aristocracy”) of the workers in Britain becoming increasingly bourgeois , owing to that country’s colonial advantages and her monopo-lies. 
 15 It is clear as daylight that the twentieth-century im-perialist monopolies in a number of other countries werebound to create the same phenomenon as in Britain. 
 In all the advanced countries we see corruption, bribery, desertion to the bourgeoisie by the leaders of the working class and its top strata in consequence of the doles handed out by the bourgeoisie, who provide these leaders with “soft jobs”, givecrumbs from their profits to these upper strata, shift theburden of the worst paid and hardest work to backward workers brought into the country, and enhance the privileges of the “labour aristocracy” as compared with themajority of the working class. 
 The war of 1914-18 has given conclusive proof of treachery to socialism and desertion to the bourgeoisie by the leaders and top strata of the proletariat, by all the social-chauvinists, Gomperses, Brantings, Renaudels, MacDonalds, Scheide-manns, etc. 
 And it goes without saying that for a time part ofthe workers by sheer inertia follow these bourgeois scoundrels. 
 The Berne International of the Huysmanses, Vanderveldes and Scheidemanns has now taken full shape as the yellowInternational of these traitors to socialism. 
 If they are not fought, if a split with them is not effected, there can be no question of any real socialism, of any sincere work for the benefit of the social revolution. 
 Let the German Independents try to sit between two stools—such is their fate. 
 The Scheidemanns embrace Kautsky as their “own man”. 
 Stampfer advertises this. 
 Indeed, Kautsky is a worthy comrade of the Scheidemanns. 
 When Hilferding,another Independent and friend of Kautsky’s, proposed atLucerne that the Scheidemanns be expelled from the Inter-national, the real leaders of the yellow International onlylaughed at him. 
 His proposal was either a piece of extreme foolishness or a piece of extreme hypocrisy; he wanted to pa-rade as a Left among the worker masses and, at the same time,retain his place in the International of bourgeois servitors!Regardless of what motivated this leader (Hilferding), thefollowing is beyond doubt—the spinelessness of the Inde-pendents and the perfidy of the Scheidemanns, Brantings and Vanderveldes are bound to result in a stronger movement of the proletarian masses away from these traitorous leaders . 
 In some countries imperialism can continue to divide theworkers for a fairly long time to come. 
 The example of Brit-ain is proof of that, but the unification of the revolutionaries, and the uniting of the masses with the revolutionaries and the expulsion of the yellow elements are, on a world scale, proceeding steadily and surely. 
 The tremendous success of theCommunist International is proof of it: in America, a Commu-nist Party has already been formed, 16 in Paris, the Committee for the Re-establishment of International Contacts and theSyndicalist Defence Committee 17 have come out for the Third International, and two Paris papers have sided with the Third International: Raymond Péricat’s L’Internationale18 and Georges Anquetil’s Le Titre censuré (Bolshevik ?). 
 In Britain, we are on the eve of the organisation of a Commu-nist Party with which the best elements in the British So-cialist Party, 19 the Shop Stewards Committees,20 the revolu-tionary trade-unionists, etc. 
, are in solidarity. 
 The Swedish Lefts, the Norwegian Social-Democrats, the Dutch Commu-nists, the Swiss 21 and Italian22 Socialist parties stand solid with the German Spartacists23 and the Russian Bolsheviks. 
 In the few months since its organisation early this year, the Communist International has become a world organisation leading the masses and unconditionally hostile to the betrayers of socialism in the yellow International of theBerne and Lucerne fraternity. 
 In conclusion, here is a highly instructive communication that casts light on the part played by the opportunist leaders. 
 The conference of yellow socialists in Lucerne this August was reported by the Geneva paper La Feuille24 in a special supplement appearing in several languages. 
 TheEnglish edition (No. 
 4, Wednesday, August 6) carried aninterview with Troelstra, the well-known leader of theopportunist party in Holland. 
 Troelstra said that the German revolution of November 9 had caused a good deal of agitation among Dutch political and trade unionleaders. 
 For a few days the ruling groups in Holland were in a state ofpanic especially as there was practically universal unrest in the army. 
 The Mayors of Rotterdam and The Hague, he continues, sought to build up their own organisations as an auxiliary force of the counter-revolution. 
 A committee composed of former generals—among theman old officer who prided himself on having shared in the suppressionof the Boxer rebellion in China—tried to mislead several of our comradesinto taking up arms against the revolution. 
 Naturally, their effortshad the very opposite result and in Rotterdam, at one time, it seemed that a workers’ council would be set up. 
 But the political and trade union leaders believed such methods premature and confined themselvesto formulating a workers’ minimum programme and publishinga strongly worded appeal to the masses. 
 That is what Troelstra said. 
 He also bragged a good deal, describing how he had delivered revolutionary speechescalling even for the seizure of power, how he realised theinadequacy of parliament and political democracy as such, how he recognised “illegal methods” of struggle and “dicta-torship of the proletariat” in the transition period, and soon and so forth. 
 Troelstra is a typical specimen of the venal, opportunist leader who serves the bourgeoisie and deceives the workers. 
In words he will accept everything —workers’ councils, pro-letarian dictatorship and whatever else you wish. 
 But actual-ly he is a vile betrayer of the workers, an agent of the bour-geoisie. 
 He is the leader of those “political and trade union leaders” that saved the Dutch bourgeoisie by joining forces with them at the decisive moment. 
 For the facts revealed by Troelstra are perfectly clear and point in a very definite direction. 
 The Dutch army had been mobilised, the proletariat was armed and united, in the army,with the poor sections of the people. 
 The German revolution inspired the workers to rise, and there was “practically uni-versal unrest in the army”. 
 Obviously, the duty of revolution-ary leaders was to lead the masses towards revolution, not to miss the opportune moment, when the arming of the work-ers and the influence of the German revolution could havedecided the issue at one stroke. 
 But the treasonable leaders, with Troelstra at their head, joined forces with the bourgeoisie. 
 The workers were stalled off with reforms and still more with promises of reforms. 
 “Strongly worded appeals” and revolutionary phrases wereused to placate—and deceive—the workers. 
 It was theTroelstras and similar “leaders”, who make up the SecondInternational of Berne and Lucerne, that saved the capital-ists by helping the bourgeoisie demobilise the army. 
 The labour movement will march forward, ousting these traitors and betrayers, the Troelstras and the Kautskys,ridding itself of the upper stratum that has turned bourgeois,is misleading the masses and pursuing capitalist policies.

S. 
 Judging by Stampfer’s article, Kautsky is now silent on the Soviet political system. 
 Has he surrendered on thiscardinal issue? Is he no longer prepared to defend the banali-ties set forth in his pamphlet against The Dictatorship of the Proletariat ? Does he prefer to pass from this chief issue to secondary ones? The answer to all these questions must awaitexamination of Kautsky’s pamphlet. 
 Published in September 1919 Published according to the manuscript TO THE AMERICAN WORKERS Comrades, About a year ago, in my letter to the American workers (dated August 20th, 1918) I exposed to you the situation in Soviet Russia and the problems facing the latter. 
 That was before the German revolution. 
 The events which since tookplace in the world’s history proved how right the Bolshevikswere in their estimation of the imperialist war of 1914-18in general and of the Entente imperialism in particular. 
As for the Soviet power it has become familiar and dear to the minds and hearts of the working masses of the whole world. 
 Everywhere the working people, in spite of the influ-ence of the old leaders with their chauvinism and opportun-ism penetrating them through and through, become aware ofthe rottenness of the bourgeois parliaments and of the necessityof the Soviet power, the power of the working people, the dictatorship of the proletariat, for the sake of the emancipation of humanity from the yoke of capital. 
 And Soviet powerwill win in the whole world, however furiously, howeverfrantically the bourgeoisie of all countries rages and storms. 
The bourgeoisie inundates Russia with blood, waging warupon us and inciting against us the counter-revolutionaries, those who wish the yoke of capital to be restored. 
 The bour-geoisie inflicts upon the working masses of Russia unprece-dented sufferings through the blockade and through the helpit gives to counter-revolution, but we have already defeatedKolchak and we are carrying on the war against Denikinwith the firm assurance of our coming victory. 
 N. 
 Lenin September 23, 1919 * * * I am often asked whether those American opponents of the war against Russia—not only workers, but mainly bourgeois—are right, who expect from us, after peace is concluded,not only resumption of trade relations, but also the possibil-ity of receiving concessions in Russia. 
 I repeat once morethat they are right. 
 A durable peace would be such a relief to the working people of Russia that they would undoubted-ly agree to certain concessions being granted. 
 The granting ofconcessions under reasonable terms is desirable also for us,as one of the means of attracting into Russia, during theperiod of the coexistence side by side of socialist and capit-alist states, the technical help of the countries which are more advanced in this respect.

 308, the manuscript November 7, 1930 THE TASKS OF THE WORKING WOMEN ’S MOVEMENT IN THE SOVIET REPUBLIC SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE FOURTH MOSCOW CITY CONFERENCE OF NON -PARTY WORKING WOMEN SEPTEMBER 23, 1919 Comrades, it gives me pleasure to greet a conference of working women. 
 I will allow myself to pass over those sub-jects and questions that, of course, at the moment are thecause of the greatest concern to every working woman and to every politically-conscious individual from among the working people; these are the most urgent questions—that ofbread and that of the war situation. 
 I know from the newspa-per reports of your meetings that these questions have beendealt with exhaustively by Comrade Trotsky as far as warquestions are concerned and by Comrades Yakovleva and Svidersky as far as the bread question is concerned; please, therefore, allow me to pass over those questions. 
 I should like to say a few words about the general tasks facing the working women’s movement in the Soviet Repub-lic, those that are, in general, connected with the transitionto socialism, and those that are of particular urgency at the present time. 
 Comrades, the question of the position of women was raised by Soviet power from the very beginning. 
It seems to me that any workers’ state in the course of tran-sition to socialism is faced with a double task. 
 The firstpart of that task is relatively simple and easy. 
 It concernsthose old laws that kept women in a position of inequality as compared to men. 
 Participants in all emancipation movements in Western Europe have long since, not for decades but for centuries, put forward the demand that obsolete laws be annulled and women and men be made equal by law, but none of the democratic European states, none of the most advanced repub-lics have succeeded in putting it into effect, because whereverthere is capitalism, wherever there is private property inland and factories, wherever the power of capital is preserved,the men retain their privileges. 
 It was possible to put itinto effect in Russia only because the power of the workers has been established here since October 25, 1917. 
 From its very inception Soviet power set out to be the power of theworking people, hostile to all forms of exploitation. 
 It set it-self the task of doing away with the possibility of the exploita-tion of the working people by the landowners and capital-ists, of doing away with the rule of capital. 
 Soviet power has been trying to make it possible for the working people to organise their lives without private property in land, with-out privately-owned factories, without that private propertythat everywhere, throughout the world, even where there iscomplete political liberty, even in the most democratic re-publics, keeps the working people in a state of what is actual-ly poverty and wage-slavery, and women in a state of double slavery. 
 Soviet power, the power of the working people, in the first months of its existence effected a very definite revolu-tion in legislation that concerns women. 
 Nothing whateveris left in the Soviet Republic of those laws that put women in a subordinate position. 
 I am speaking specifically of those laws that took advantage of the weaker position of womenand put them in a position of inequality and often, even,in a humiliating position, i. 
e. 
, the laws on divorce and onchildren born out of wedlock and on the right of a woman tosummon the father of a child for maintenance. 
 It is particularly in this sphere that bourgeois legislation, even, it must be said, in the most advanced countries, takesadvantage of the weaker position of women to humiliatethem and give them a status of inequality. 
 It is particularlyin this sphere that Soviet power has left nothing whateverof the old, unjust laws that were intolerable for working peo-ple. 
 We may now say proudly and without any exaggeration that apart from Soviet Russia there is not a country in theworld where women enjoy full equality and where women are not placed in the humiliating position felt particularly in day-to-day family life. 
 This was one of our first and most important tasks. 
 If you have occasion to come into contact with parties that are hostile to the Bolsheviks, if there should come intoyour hands newspapers published in Russian in the regionsoccupied by Kolchak or Denikin, or if you happen to talk topeople who share the views of those newspapers, you may often hear from them the accusation that Soviet power has violated democracy. 
 We, the representatives of Soviet power, Bolshevik Com-munists and supporters of Soviet power are often accusedof violating democracy and proof of this is given by citingthe fact that Soviet power dispersed the Constituent Assemb-ly. 
 We usually answer this accusation as follows: that democ-racy and that Constituent Assembly which came into beingwhen private property still existed on earth, when therewas no equality between people, when the one who possessedhis own capital was the boss and the others worked for himand were his wage-slaves—that was a democracy on which we place no value. 
 Such democracy concealed slavery even in the most advanced countries. 
 We socialists are supportersof democracy only insofar as it eases the position of theworking and oppressed people. 
 Throughout the world social-ism has set itself the task of combating every kind of exploi-tation of man by man. 
 That democracy has real value for us which serves the exploited, the underprivileged. 
 If those who do not work are disfranchised that would be real equal-ity between people. 
 Those who do not work shouldnot eat. 
 In reply to these accusations we say that the question must be presented in this way—how is democracy implemented in various countries? We see that equality is proclaimed in all democratic republics but in the civil laws and in laws onthe rights of women—those that concern their position inthe family and divorce—we see inequality and the humilia-tion of women at every step, and we say that this is a viola-tion of democracy specifically in respect of the oppressed. 
 Soviet power has implemented democracy to a greater degree than any of the other, most advanced countries because ithas not left in its laws any trace of the inequality of women. 
 Again I say that no other state and no other legislation has ever done for women a half of what Soviet power did in the first months of its existence. 
 Laws alone, of course, are not enough, and we are by no means content with mere decrees. 
 In the sphere of legisla-tion, however, we have done everything required of us to putwomen in a position of equality and we have every right tobe proud of it. 
 The position of women in Soviet Russia is now ideal as compared with their position in the most advanced states. 
 We tell ourselves, however, that this is, of course,only the beginning. 
 Owing to her work in the house, the woman is still in a difficult position. 
 To effect her complete emancipation andmake her the equal of the man it is necessary for the national economy to be socialised and for women to participate in common productive labour. 
 Then women will occupy thesame position as men. 
 Here we are not, of course, speaking of making women the equal of men as far as productivity of labour, the quantityof labour, the length of the working day, labour conditions, etc. 
, are concerned; we mean that the woman should not, unlike the man, be oppressed because of her position in thefamily. 
 You all know that even when women have full rights,they still remain factually downtrodden because all house-work is left to them. 
 In most cases housework is the most un-productive, the most barbarous and the most arduous work a woman can do. 
 It is exceptionally petty and does not include anything that would in any way promote the development ofthe woman. 
 In pursuance of the socialist ideal we want to struggle for the full implementation of socialism, and here an extensivefield of labour opens up before women. 
 We are now making serious preparations to clear the ground for the building of socialism, but the building of socialism will begin onlywhen we have achieved the complete equality of women andwhen we undertake the new work together with women whohave been emancipated from that petty, stultifying, un-productive work. 
 This is a job that will take us many, many years. 
 This work cannot show any rapid results and will not prod-uce a scintillating effect. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR We are setting up model institutions, dining-rooms and nurseries, that will emancipate women from housework. 
 And the work of organising all these institutions will fall mainly to women. 
 It has to be admitted that in Russia todaythere are very few institutions that would help woman out ofher state of household slavery. 
 There is an insignificantnumber of them, and the conditions now obtaining in theSoviet Republic—the war and food situation about which comrades have already given you the details—hinder us in this work. 
 Still, it must be said that these institutions thatliberate women from their position as household slavesare springing up wherever it is in any way possible. 
 We say that the emancipation of the workers must be ef-fected by the workers themselves, and in exactly the same way the emancipation of working women is a matter for the working women themselves. 
 The working women must them-selves see to it that such institutions are developed, and thisactivity will bring about a complete change in their positionas compared with what it was under the old, capitalist socie-ty. 
 In order to be active in politics under the old, capitalist regime special training was required, so that women playedan insignificant part in politics, even in the most advancedand free capitalist countries. 
 Our task is to make politicsavailable to every working woman. 
 Ever since private prop-erty in land and factories has been abolished and the power of the landowners and capitalists overthrown, the tasks of politics have become simple, clear and comprehensible tothe working people as a whole, including working women. 
In capitalist society the woman’s position is marked by suchinequality that the extent of her participation in politicsis only an insignificant fraction of that of the man. 
 The power of the working people is necessary for a change to be wrought in this situation, for then the main tasks of politics willconsist of matters directly affecting the fate of the workingpeople themselves. 
 Here, too, the participation of working women is essential —not only of party members and politically-conscious women, but also of the non-party women and those who are least politically conscious. 
 Here Soviet power opens up awide field of activity to working women. 
 We have had a difficult time in the struggle against the forces hostile to Soviet Russia that have attacked her. 
 It was difficult for us to fight on the battlefield against the forces who went to war against the power of the working peopleand in the field of food supplies against the profiteers, becauseof the too small number of people, working people, whocame whole-heartedly to our aid with their own labour. 
 Here,too, there is nothing Soviet power can appreciate as much as the help given by masses of non-party working women. 
 They may know that in the old, bourgeois society, perhaps, acomprehensive training was necessary for participation inpolitics and that this was not available to women. 
 The polit-ical activity of the Soviet Republic is mainly the struggleagainst the landowners and capitalists, the struggle for the elimination of exploitation; political activity, therefore, is made available to the working woman in the Soviet Republicand it will consist in the working woman using her organisa-tional ability to help the working man. 
 What we need is not only organisational work on a scale involving millions; we need organisational work on the small-est scale and this makes it possible for women to work as well. 
 Women can work under war conditions when it is aquestion of helping the army or carrying on agitation in thearmy. 
 Women should take an active part in all this so thatthe Red Army sees that it is being looked after, that solicitudeis being displayed. 
 Women can also work in the sphere of food distribution, on the improvement of public catering and everywhere opening dining-rooms like those that are sonumerous in Petrograd. 
 It is in these fields that the activities of working women acquire the greatest organisational significance. 
 The parti-cipation of working women is also essential in the organisa-tion and running of big experimental farms and should not take place only in isolated cases. 
 This is something that cannot becarried out without the participation of a large number ofworking women. 
 Working women will be very useful in thisfield in supervising the distribution of food and in makingfood products more easily obtainable. 
 This work can well be done by non-party working women and its accomplishment will do more than anything else to strengthen socialistsociety. 
 We have abolished private property in land and almost completely abolished the private ownership of factories; Soviet power is now trying to ensure that all working people, non-party as well as Party members, women as well as men,should take part in this economic development. 
 The workthat Soviet power has begun can only make progress when,instead of a few hundreds, millions and millions of womenthroughout Russia take part in it. 
 We are sure that the cause of socialist development will then become sound. 
 Then the working people will show that they can live and run theircountry without the aid of the landowners and capitalists. 
Then socialist construction will be so soundly based in Rus-sia that no external enemies in other countries and noneinside Russia will be any danger to the Soviet Republic. 
 Pravda No. 
 213, Published according to the text September 25, 1919 of the pamphlet, V. 
 I. 
 Lenin, Speech at the Working Women ’s Congress , Moscow, 1919 , verified with the Pravda text THE EXAMPL E OF THE PETROGRA D WORKER S25 The newspapers have already reported that the Petrograd workers have begun the intensive mobilisation and dispatch of the best workers to the Southern Front. 
 Denikin’s capture of Kursk and advance on Orel fully ex-plain this energetic action of the Petrograd proletariat,whose example must be followed by the workers of otherindustrial centres. 
 The Denikin gang count on sowing panic in our ranks and making us think only of defence, only of the matter in hand. 
 The foreign radio shows how zealously the French and Brit-ish imperialists are helping Denikin, how they are helpinghim with armaments and hundreds of millions of rubles. 
The foreign radio proclaims to the whole world that the roadto Moscow lies open. 
 That is how the capitalists would liketo frighten us. 
 But they will not succeed in frightening us. 
 The deploy-ment of our troops has been carefully planned and strictlycarried out. 
 Our offensive against the chief source of theenemy’s strength steadily continues. 
 The victories recentlywon—the capture of 20 guns in the Boguchar area, thecapture of the village of Veshenskaya—indicate the success-ful advance of our troops to the centre of the Cossack area, which alone enabled and still enables Denikin to organise aserious force. 
 Denikin will be smashed as Kolchak has beensmashed. 
 They cannot frighten us and we shall bring ourcause to a victorious conclusion. 
 The capture of Kursk and the enemy’s advance on Orel required the provision of additional forces in order to repelhim there. 
 By their example the Petrograd workers haveshown that they have correctly understood this task. 
 Without hiding the dangers from ourselves, and without in any way minimising them, we say: Petrograd has shown that we do have additional forces. 
 In order to repel the attack on Orel and to launch an offensive against Kursk and Kharkov, thebest proletarians must be mobilised, over and above theforces we already have at our disposal. 
 The fall of Kurskconstitutes a serious danger; never has the enemy been sonear to Moscow. 
 In addition to the previous army forces, we are dispatching new contingents of advanced workers capa-ble of changing the mood of the retreating units to ward offthis danger. 
 Among our troops in the South, deserters who have returned to the ranks occupy a prominent place. 
 Most of them havereturned voluntarily, under the influence of the propaganda which has explained where their duty lies and shown them how serious is the threat that the power of the landowners andcapitalists will be restored. 
 But the deserters do not hold out,they lack staunchness and quite often they begin to retreatwithout fighting. 
 That is why it is of prime importance to strengthen the army by a new influx of proletarian forces. 
 The unstable elements will be given strength, morale will be raised, aturning-point will be reached. 
 As has continually happenedin our revolution, the proletariat will support and guide thewavering sections of the working population. 
 For a long time now the Petrograd workers have had to bear much greater burdens than the workers of other indust-rial centres. 
 The Petrograd proletariat has suffered more thanthe proletariat in other localities from famine, the perils ofwar and the withdrawal of the best workers for Soviet dutiesthroughout Russia. 
 Yet we see that there has not been the slightest dejection, not the slightest diminution of energy among the Petrograd workers. 
 On the contrary, they have become steeled, theyhave found new strength and have brought new fighters tothe fore. 
 They are excellently fulfilling the duty of a leadingcontingent, sending aid and support where it is most needed. 
 When such fresh forces go to reinforce units of our army that have wavered, the mass of the working people, the soldiers of peasant origin obtain new leaders from among their ownkind, from the more developed, more politically-conscious, and more staunch-minded working people. 
 That is why such help to our peasant army gives us a decisive superiority over the enemy, for in his case it is only landowners’ sons who are sent out to strengthen his peasant army, and we knowthat this “strengthening” has ruined Kolchak and will ruinDenikin. 
 Comrade workers! Let all of you set about the new work after the example of the Petrograd comrades! More energy for activities in the army, more initiative and boldness, more emulation so as to equal the Petrograders, and victory willbe won by the working people, the landowner and capitalistcounter-revolution will be beaten.

 257, October 27, 1919 First published in Russian in 1942 Published according to the newspaper text GREETINGS TO ITALIAN, FRENCH AND GERMAN COMMUNISTS Scant indeed is the news we get from abroad. 
 The blockade by the imperialist beasts is in full swing; the violence of the biggest world powers is turned against us in the hope of res-toring the rule of the exploiters. 
 And all this bestial fury ofthe Russian and world capitalists is cloaked, needless to say,in phrases about the lofty significance of “democracy”! Theexploiter camp is true to itself; it depicts bourgeois democracyas “democracy” in general. 
 And all the philistines and petty bourgeois, down to Friedrich Adler, Karl Kautsky and the majority of the leaders of the Independent (that is,independent of the revolutionary proletariat but dependenton petty-bourgeois prejudices) Social-Democratic Party ofGermany, join in the chorus. 
 But the more infrequently we in Russia receive news from abroad, the greater the joy with which we follow the gigan-tic, universal advance of communism among the workersin all the countries of the world, the successful severance ofthe masses from the corrupt and treacherous leaders who, fromScheidemann to Kautsky, have gone over to the bourgeoisie. 
 All that we know of the Italian Party is that its Congress has resolved by a huge majority to affiliate to the Third International and to adopt the programme of the dictator-ship of the proletariat. 
 Thus, the Italian Socialist Party has,in practice, aligned itself with communism, though to ourregret it still retains its old name. 
 Warm greetings to theItalian workers and their party! All that we know of France is that in Paris alone there are already two communist newspapers: L’Internationale edited by Raymond Péricat, and Le Titre censuré edited by Georges Anquetil. 
 A number of proletarian organisations have al-ready affiliated to the Third International. 
 The sympathies of the workers are undoubtedly on the side of communism and Soviet power. 
 Of the German Communists we know only that communist newspapers are published in a number of towns. 
 Many bearthe name Die Rote Fahne . 
 28 The Berlin Rote Fahne , an illegal publication, is battling heroically against the Scheidemanns and Noskes, the butchers who play flunkey to the bourgeoi-sie in deeds, just as the Independents do in words and intheir “ideological” (petty-bourgeois ideological) propaganda. 
 The heroic struggle of Die Rote Fahne , the Berlin commu-nist paper, evokes whole-hearted admiration. 
 At last we seein Germany honest and sincere socialists, who, despite all persecution, despite the foul murder of their best leaders, have remained firm and unbending! At last we see in Germa-ny communist workers who are waging a heroic struggle thatreally deserves to be called “revolutionary”! At last there hasemerged from the very midst of the proletarian masses inGermany a force for which the words “proletarian revolu-tion” have become a truth ! Greetings to the German Communists!The Scheidemanns and Kautskys, the Renners and Fried-rich Adlers, great as the difference between these gentlemenin the sense of personal integrity may probably be, havein equal measure proved to be petty bourgeois, most shameful traitors to and betrayers of socialism, supporters of the bourgeoisie. 
 For in 1912 all of them took part in draftingand signing the Basle Manifesto 29 on the approaching imperial-ist war, all of them spoke then about “ proletarian revolution”, and all of them proved in practice to be petty-bourgeoisdemocrats, knights of philistine-republican, bourgeois-demo-cratic illusions, accomplices of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie. 
 The savage persecution to which the German Communists have been subjected has strengthened them. 
 If at the momentthey are somewhat disunited, this testifies to the breadthand mass character of their movement, to the vigour with which communism is growing out of the very midst of the masses of workers. 
 It is inevitable that a movement so ruth-lessly persecuted by the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie and their Scheidemann-Noske henchmen and forced to orga-nise illegally should be disunited. 
 And it is natural, too, that a movement which is growing so rapidly and experiencing such desperate persecutionshould give rise to rather sharp differences. 
 There is nothingterrible in that; it is a matter of growing pains. 
 Let the Scheidemanns and Kautskys gloat in their Vor-wärts and Freiheit about the differences among the Commun-ists. 
 There is nothing left for these heroes of rotten philistin-ism but to cover up their rottenness by pointing to the Com-munists. 
 But if we take the real state of affairs we realisethat only the blind can now fail to see the truth. 
 And thetruth is that the followers of Scheidemann and Kautsky haveshamelessly betrayed the proletarian revolution in Germany, broken faith with it and have, in fact , sided with the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie. 
 Heinrich Laufenberg in his ex-cellent pamphlet, From the First Revolution to the Second , demonstrated this and proved it with remarkable force,vividness, clarity and conviction. 
 The differences among thefollowers of Scheidemann and Kautsky are differences within disintegrating, dying parties of which there remain only leaders without masses, generals without armies. 
 The massesare abandoning the Scheidemanns and going over to the Kaut-skys, being attracted by their Left wing (this is borne outby any report of a mass meeting), and this Left wing com-bines—in unprincipled and cowardly fashion—the old preju-dices of the petty bourgeoisie about parliamentary democra-cy with communist recognition of the proletarian revolution,the dictatorship of the proletariat and Soviet power. 
 Under mass pressure, the rotten leaders of the Independents acknowledge all this in words, but in deeds they remain pet-ty-bourgeois democrats, “socialists” of the type of Louis Blanc and the other dolts of 1848 who were so mercilessly ridiculed and branded by Marx. 
 Here we have differences that are really irreconcilable. 
 There can be no peace, no joint work, between the proletarianrevolutionaries and the philistines, who, like those of1848, worship at the shrine of bourgeois “democracy” without understanding its bourgeois nature. 
 Haase and Kautsky, Friedrich Adler and Otto Bauer can twist and squirm as muchas they like, use up reams of paper and make endless speeches, but they cannot get away from the fact that in prac-tice they absolutely fail to understand the dictatorship of the proletariat and Soviet power, that in practice they are petty-bourgeois democrats, “socialists” of the Louis Blanc andLedru-Rollin type, that in practice they are, at best, puppets in the hands of the bourgeoisie, and, at worst, direct hire-lings of the bourgeoisie. 
 The Independents, the Kautskyites and the Austrian So-cial-Democrats seem to be united parties, actually, on the basic, chief and most essential issue, most of their partymembers do not agree with the leaders. 
 The party member-ship will wage a proletarian revolutionary struggle for Soviet power the very moment a new crisis sets in, and the “leaders”will act as counter-revolutionaries as they do now. 
 To sit between two stools is not a difficult matter in words; Hilferd-ing in Germany and Friedrich Adler in Austria are giving amodel display of this noble art. 
 But people who try to reconcile the irreconcilable will prove to be mere soap-bubbles in the heat of the revolution-ary struggle. 
 This was demonstrated by all the “socialist” heroes of 1848, by their Menshevik and Socialist-Revolution-ary kindred in Russia in 1917-19, and is being demonstrat-ed by all the knights of the Berne, or yellow, Second Inter-national. 
 The differences among the Communists are of another kind. 
 Only those who do not want to cannot see the fundamental distinction. 
 The differences among the Communists are dif-ferences between representatives of a mass movement thathas grown with incredible rapidity; and the Communists havea single, common, granite-like foundation—recognition ofthe proletarian revolution and of the struggle against bour-geois-democratic illusions and bourgeois-democratic parliam-entarism, and recognition of the dictatorship of the pro-letariat and Soviet power. 
 On such a basis differences are nothing to worry about, they represent growing pains, not senile decay. 
 Bolshevism,too, has experienced differences of this kind more thanonce, as well as minor breakaways caused by such differ-ences, but at the decisive moment, at the moment of taking power and establishing the Soviet Republic, Bolshevism wasunited; it drew to itself all that was best in the trends of socialist thought akin to it and rallied round itself the entire vanguard of the proletariat and the overwhelming majority of the working people. 
 And so it will be with the German Communists, too. 
The followers of Scheidemann and Kautsky still talk about “democracy” in general, they still live in the ideas of 1848,they are Marxists in words, Louis Blancs in deeds. 
 Theyprattle about the “majority” and believe that equality of ballot-papers signifies equality of exploited and exploiter, of worker and capitalist, of poor and rich, of the hungry andthe satiated. 
 The Scheidemanns and the Kautskys would have us believe that the kind-hearted, honest, noble, peace-loving capital-ists have never used the force of wealth, the force of money, the power of capital, the oppression of bureaucracy and military dictatorship, but have decided matters truly “bymajority”! The Scheidemanns and the Kautskys (partly from hypoc-risy, partly from extreme stupidity, instilled by decades ofreformist activity) prettify bourgeois democracy, bourgeois parliamentarism and the bourgeois republic, so as to make it appear that the capitalists decide affairs of state by thewill of the majority, and not by the will of capital, not bymeans of deception and oppression and the violence of therich against the poor. 
 The Scheidemanns and Kautskys are ready to “recognise” the proletarian revolution, but only with the proviso that first, while the force, power, oppression and privileges ofcapital and wealth are retained , the majority of the people shall vote (with the voting supervised by the bourgeois appa-ratus of state power) “ for revolution ”! It is difficult to imagine the extent of the philistine stupidity displayed in these views, or the extent of the philistine gullibility ( Vertrauens-duselei ) in the capitalists, in the bourgeoisie, in the generals, and in the bourgeois apparatus of state power. 
 Actually, it is precisely the bourgeoisie that has always played the hypocrite by characterising formal equality as“democracy”, and in practice using force against the poor, the working people, the small peasants and the workers, by employing countless means of deception, oppression, etc. 
The imperialist war (that the Scheidemanns and the Kautskys painted in shamelessly bright colours) has made this plain to millions of people. 
 Proletarian dictatorship is the sole means of defending the working people against the oppression of capital, the violence of bourgeois military dictatorship,and imperialist war. 
 Proletarian dictatorship is the solestep to equality and democracy in practice , not on paper, but in life, not in political phrase-mongering, but in econom-ic reality. 
 Having failed to understand this, the Scheidemanns and the Kautskys proved to be contemptible traitors to so-cialism and defenders of the ideas of the bourgeoisie. 
 * * * The Kautskyite (or Independent) party is dying. 
 It is bound to die and disintegrate soon as a result of the diffe-rences between its predominantly revolutionary member-ship and its counter-revolutionary “leaders”. 
 The Communist Party, experiencing exactly the same (es-sentially the same) differences as were experienced by Bol-shevism, will grow stronger and become as hard as steel. 
 The differences among the German Communists boil down, so far as I can judge, to the question of “utilising the legalpossibilities” (as the Bolsheviks used to say in the 1910-13period), of utilising the bourgeois parliament, the reaction-ary trade unions, the law on works’ councils ( Betriebsratge-setz), bodies that have been hamstrung by the Scheidemanns and Kautskys; it is a question of whether to participate insuch bodies or boycott them. 
 We Russian Bolsheviks experienced quite similar differ-ences in 1906 and in the 1910-12 period. 
 And for us it isclear that with many of the young German Communists it is simply a case of a lack of revolutionary experience. 
 Had they experienced a couple of bourgeois revolutions (1905 and 1917),they would not be advocating the boycott so unconditional-ly, nor fall from time to time into the mistakes of syndical-ism. 
 This is a matter of growing pains; the movement is develop-ing in fine style and as it grows they will pass. 
 And these ob-vious mistakes must be combated openly; the differencesmust not be exaggerated since it must be clear to everyone that in the near future the struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat, for Soviet power, will wipe out the greater part of them. 
 Both from the standpoint of Marxist theory and the exper-ience of three revolutions (1905, February 1917 and October1917) I regard refusal to participate in a bourgeois parliament,in a reactionary (Legien, Gompers, etc. 
) trade union, in anultra-reactionary workers’ council hamstrung by the Schei-demanns, etc. 
, as an undoubted mistake. 
 At times, in individual cases, in individual countries, the boycott is correct, as, for example, was the Bolshevikboycott of the tsarist Duma in 1905. 
 But the selfsame Bol-sheviks took part in the much more reactionary and down-right counter-revolutionary Duma of 1907. 
 The Bolsheviks contested the elections to the bourgeois Constituent Assembly in 1917, and in 1918 we dispersed it, to the horror of the phil-istine democrats, the Kautskys and other such renegadesfrom socialism. 
 We worked in the ultra-reactionary, purelyMenshevik, trade unions which (in their counter-revolution-ary nature) yielded nothing to the Legien unions—the foul-est and most reactionary trade unions in Germany. 
 Even now, two years after the conquest of state power, we have not yetfinished fighting the remnants of the Menshevik (i. 
e. 
, theScheidemann, Kautsky, Gompers, etc. 
) trade unions—solong is the process! So strong in some places and in sometrades is the influence of petty-bourgeois ideas! At one time we were in a minority in the Soviets, the trade unions and the co-operatives. 
 By persistent effortand long struggle—both before and after the conquest of political power—we won a majority, first in all workers’ organisations, then in non-worker and, finally, even insmall-peasant organisations. 
 Only scoundrels or simpletons can think that the proletar-iat must first win a majority in elections carried out under the yoke of the bourgeoisie , under the yoke of wage-slavery , and must then win power. 
 This is the height of stupidity orhypocrisy; it is substituting elections, under the old systemand with the old power, for class struggle and revolution. 
 The proletariat wages its class struggle and does not wait for elections to begin a strike, although for the complete suc-cess of a strike it is necessary to have the sympathy of the majority of the working people (and, it follows, of the major-ity of the population); the proletariat wages its class struggle and overthrows the bourgeoisie without waiting for any pre-liminary elections (supervised by the bourgeoisie and carriedout under its yoke); and the proletariat is perfectly wellaware that for the success of its revolution, for the successfuloverthrow of the bourgeoisie, it is absolutely necessary to have the sympathy of the majority of the working people (and, it follows, of the majority of the population). 
 The parliamentary cretins and latter-day Louis Blancs “insist” absolutely on elections, on elections that are most cer-tainly supervised by the bourgeoisie, to ascertain whetherthey have the sympathy of the majority of the working peo-ple. 
 But this is the attitude of pedants, of living corpses, or of cunning tricksters. 
 Real life and the history of actual revolutions show that quite often the “sympathy of the majority of the workingpeople” cannot be demonstrated by any elections (to saynothing of elections supervised by the exploiters, with“equality” of exploiters and exploited!). 
 Quite often the “sympathy of the majority of the working people” is demon-strated not by elections at all, but by the growth of one of theparties, or by its increased representation in the Soviets,or by the success of a strike which for some reason hasacquired enormous significance, or by successes won in civilwar, etc. 
, etc. 
 The history of our revolution has shown, for example, that sympathy for the dictatorship of the proletariat on thepart of the majority of the working people in the boundlessexpanses of the Urals and Siberia was ascertained not by meansof elections, but by the experience of a year of the tsaristgeneral Kolchak’s rule in that area. 
 Incidentally, Kolchak’s rule also began with a “coalition” of the Scheidemann and Kautsky crowd (in Russian they are called Mensheviks andSocialist-Revolutionaries, supporters of the Constituent As-sembly), just as in Germany at the moment the Haases andScheidemanns, through their “coalition”, are paving the wayto power for von Goltz or Ludendorff and covering up this power and making it look decent. 
 In parenthesis it should be said that the Haase-Scheidemann coalition in the govern-ment has ended, but the political coalition of these betrayers of socialism remains. 
 Proof: Kautsky’s books, Stamp-fer’s articles in Vorwärts , the articles by the Kautskys and the Scheidemanns about their “unification”, and so on. 
 The proletarian revolution is impossible without the sym-pathy and support of the overwhelming majority of theworking people for their vanguard—the proletariat. 
 But thissympathy and this support are not forthcoming immediately and are not decided by elections. 
 They are won in the course of long, arduous and stern class struggle. 
 The class strugglewaged by the proletariat for the sympathy and support of the majority of the working people does not end with the con-quest of political power by the proletariat. 
 After the con-quest of power this struggle continues, but in other forms. 
 In the Russian revolution the circumstances were exception-ally favourable for the proletariat (in its struggle for itsdictatorship), since the proletarian revolution took place at atime when all the people were under arms and when thepeasantry as a whole, disgusted by the “Kautskyite”policy of the social-traitors, the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, wanted the overthrow of the rule of the landowners. 
 But even in Russia, where things were exceptionally fa-vourable at the moment of the proletarian revolution, wherea most remarkable unity of the entire proletariat, the entirearmy and the entire peasantry was achieved at once—even in Russia, the proletariat, exercising its dictatorship, had to struggle for months and years to win the sympathy and sup-port of the majority of the working people. 
 After two yearsthis struggle has practically, but still not completely, endedin favour of the proletariat. 
 In two years we have won thefull sympathy and support of the overwhelming majority of the workers and labouring peasants of Great Russia, includ-ing the Urals and Siberia, but as yet we have not wonthe full support and sympathy of the majority of the workingpeasants (as distinct from the peasant exploiters) of theUkraine. 
 We could be (but shall not be) crushed by the mili-tary might of the Entente, but inside Russia we now have such sound sympathy, and from such an enormous majority of the working people, that our state is the most democraticstate the world has ever seen. 
 One has only to give some thought to this complex, dif-ficult and long history of proletarian struggle for power— a struggle rich in the extraordinary variety of forms and in the unusual abundance of sharp changes, turns andswitches from one form to another—to see clearly the error ofthose who would “forbid” participation in bourgeois parlia-ments, reactionary trade unions, tsarist or ScheidemannShop Stewards Committees or works’ councils, and so on and so forth. 
 This error is due to the lack of revolutionary exper-ience among quite sincere, convinced and valiant working-class revolutionaries. 
 Consequently, Karl Liebknecht andRosa Luxemburg were a thousand times right in January1919 when they realised this mistake, pointed it out, butnevertheless chose to remain with the proletarian revolution-aries, mistaken though they were on a minor question, rather than side with the traitors to socialism, the Scheidemanns andthe Kautskys, who made no mistake on the question of par-ticipating in bourgeois parliaments, but had ceased to be so-cialists and had become philistine democrats and accomplicesof the bourgeoisie. 
 A mistake, however, remains a mistake and it is necessary to criticise it and fight for its rectification. 
 The fight against the traitors to socialism, the Scheide-manns and the Kautskys, must be waged mercilessly, butnot on the issue of for or against participation in bourgeoisparliaments, reactionary trade unions, etc. 
 This would be an obvious mistake, and a bigger mistake still would be to retreat from the ideas of Marxism and its practical line (astrong, centralised political party) to the ideas and practiceof syndicalism. 
 It is necessary to work for the Party’s parti-cipation in bourgeois parliaments, in reactionary trade uni-ons and in “works’ councils” that have been mutilated and castrated in Scheidemann fashion, for the Party to be wherever workers are to be found, wherever it is possible to talkto workers, to influence the working masses. 
 Legal and ille-gal work must at all costs be combined, the illegal Party,through its workers’ organisations, must exercise systematic,constant and strict control over legal activity. 
 This is no easy matter, but the proletarian revolution, generally speak-ing, knows nothing and can know nothing of “easy” tasks or“easy” means of struggle. 
 This difficult task must be carried out at all costs. 
 The Scheidemann and Kautsky gang differ from us not only (and not chiefly) because they do not recognise the armed upris-ing and we do. 
 The chief and radical difference is that in all spheres of work (in bourgeois parliaments, trade unions, co-operatives, journalistic work, etc. 
) they pursue aninconsistent, opportunist policy, even a policy of downrighttreachery and betrayal. 
 Fight against the social-traitors, against reformism and opportunism—this political line can and must be followedwithout exception in all spheres of our struggle. 
 And then we shall win the working masses. 
 And the vanguard of theproletariat, the Marxist centralised political party togetherwith the working masses will take the people along the true road to the triumph of proletarian dictatorship, to proletar-ian instead of bourgeois democracy, to the Soviet Republic,to the socialist system. 
 In the space of a few months the Third International has won a number of glorious, unprecedented victories. 
 Thespeed of its growth is astonishing. 
 Particular mistakes and growing pains give no grounds for alarm. 
 By criticising them directly and openly, we shall ensure that the workingmasses of all cultured countries, educated in the spirit ofMarxism, quickly rid themselves of the betrayers of social-ism, the Scheidemanns and Kautskys of all nations (for these traitors are to be found in all nations). 
 The victory of communism is inevitable. 
 Communism will triumph.

 Lenin October 10, 1919 Published in October 1919 Published according to the manuscript THE WORKERS’ STATE AND PARTY WEEK Moscow Party Week30 comes at a time of difficulty for the Soviet government. 
 Denikin’s successes have given rise to afrenzied increase in plots by the landowners, capitalists and their friends, and increased efforts on the part of the bourgeoi-sie to sow panic and undermine the strength of the Sovietrule by every means in their power. 
 The vacillating, waver-ing, politically backward petty bourgeois, and with them theintelligentsia, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Menshe-viks, have, as usual, become more shaky than ever and were the first to allow themselves to be intimidated by the capitalists. 
 Moscow Party Week at such a difficult time is, I think, something of an advantage to us, for it is much better forthe cause. 
 We do not need a Party Week for show purposes. 
We do not need fictitious Party members even as a gift. 
 Our Party, the party of the revolutionary working class, is the only government party in the world which is concernednot with increasing its membership but with improving itsquality, and purging itself of “self-seekers”. 
 We have morethan once carried out the re-registration of Party membersin order to get rid of these “self-seekers” and to leave in the Party only politically-conscious elements who are sincerely devoted to communism. 
 31 We have further taken advantage of the mobilisations for the front and of the subbotniksto purge the Party of those who are only “out for” the benefitsaccruing to membership of a government party and donot want to bear the burden of devoted work on behalf of communism. 
 And at this juncture, when intensified mobilisation for the front is in progress, Party Week is a good thing because it offers no temptation to the self-seekers. 
 We extend a broad invitation into the Party only to rank-and-file workers and poor peasants, to labouring peasants, but not to the peasant profiteers. 
 We do not promise and do not give these rank-and-file members any advantages from joining the Party. 
 On thecontrary, just now harder and more dangerous work thanusual falls to the lot of Party members. 
 So much the better. 
 Only sincere supporters of communism, only persons who are conscientiously devoted to the workers’ state, only honest working people, only genuine representa-tives of the masses that were oppressed under capitalism willjoin the Party. 
 And it is only such members that we need in the Party. 
We need new Party members not for advertising purposes but for serious work. 
 These are the people we invite into the Party. 
 To the working people we throw the doors of the Partywide open. 
 Soviet power is the power of the working people that is fighting for the complete overthrow of the yoke of capital. 
The first to engage in this fight were the working class of the towns and the factory centres. 
 They won the first victory and conquered state power. 
 The working class is winning to their side the majority of the peasants. 
 For it is only the peasant huckster, the peasantprofiteer, and not the labouring peasant who is drawn to theside of capital, to the side of the bourgeoisie. 
 The workers of Petrograd, the most advanced, the most politically-conscious workers, have been contributing mostof all to the administration of Russia. 
 But we know thatamong the rank-and-file workers and peasants there are verymany people devoted to the interests of the working massesand capable of undertaking the work of leadership. 
 Among them there are many with a talent for organisation and admin-istration to whom capitalism gave no opportunity and whomwe are helping and must help in every way to come to thefore and take up the work of building socialism. 
 To discoverthese new, modest and unperceived talents is no easy matter. 
It is no easy matter to enlist for state administrative work rank-and-file workers and peasants who for centuries had been downtrodden and intimidated by the landowners andcapitalists. 
 But this difficult work has to be done, it must be done, so as to draw more deeply on the working class and the labouring peasantry for new forces. 
 Comrades, non-party workers and labouring peasants, join the Party! We promise you no advantages from join-ing; it is hard work we are calling you to, the work of organis-ing the state. 
 If you are sincere supporters of communism, setabout this work boldly, do not fear its novelty and the dif-ficulty it entails, do not be put off by the old prejudice that only those who have received formal training are capableof this work. 
 That is not true. 
 The work of building socialismcan and must be directed by rank-and-file workers andlabouring peasants in ever-growing numbers. 
 The mass of the working people are with us. 
 That is where our strength lies. 
 That is the source of the invincibility of world communism. 
 More new workers from among the massesfor the ranks of the Party to take an independent part inbuilding the new life—that is our method of combating alldifficulties, that is our path to victory.

 Lenin SPEECH TO MOBILISED WORKER COMMUNISTS DELIVERED THE BALCONY OF MOSCOW SOVIET OF WORKERS’ AND RED ARMY DEPUTIES OCTOBER 16, 1919 NEWSPAPER REPORT (Lenin is greeted with stormy applause . 
) Comrades, permit me to greet the workers of Yaroslavl and Vladimir gubernias who have once again answered our call and given their best forces for the defence of the workers’ and peasants’ republic. 
You know from the newspapers in which we print the wholetruth, concealing nothing, what new and ominous danger isembodied in the capture of Orel by the tsarist general Denikinand the threat to Red Petrograd by Yudenich. 
 But we regard this danger, and we struggle against it, in the way we always have—we appeal to the politically-conscious proletariat andworking peasantry to stand firm in defence of their gains. 
 The situation is extremely grave. 
 But we do not despair, for we know that every time a difficult situation for theSoviet Republic arises the workers display miracles of valour and by their example encourage and inspire the troops and lead them on to fresh victories. 
 We know that throughout the world, in all countries, the revolutionary movement is growing, slower than we wouldlike, but definitely growing. 
 We also know that the victoryof the working class throughout the world is certain. 
 Great as the sacrifices made by Russia are, greatly as she has been tormented and mutilated, she is neverthelessfighting persistently for the cause of all workers. 
 The impe-rialists may crush another republic or two, but they cannot save world imperialism, for it is doomed and will be swept away by the coming socialism. 
 That is why I greet you, workers of Vladimir and Yaroslavl gubernias, in the firm conviction that you will, by your per-sonal example, strengthen the spirit of the Red Army andlead it to victory. 
 Long live the workers and peasants! Long live the world workers’ republic! Pravda No. 
 232, Published according to October 12, 1919 the Pravda text TO THE WORKERS AND RED ARMY MEN OF PETROGRAD Comrades, the decisive moment has arrived. 
 The tsarist generals have again been provided with munitions and other supplies by the capitalists of Britain, France and America, and with gangs of landowners’ sons are again trying to cap-ture Red Petrograd. 
 The enemy launched his attack at thetime of the peace negotiations with Estonia, attacked ourRed Army troops who believed in these negotiations. 
 Thetreacherous nature of the attack partly explains the rapid successes of the enemy. 
 Krasnoye Selo, Gatchina and Vyritsa have been captured. 
 Two railway lines to Petrograd have beencut. 
 The enemy is trying to cut the third, Nikolayevskaya,line, and the fourth, Vologda, line so as to starve Petrogradinto surrender. 
 Comrades, you all know and can see for yourselves the tremendous threat hanging over Petrograd. 
 A few days will decide the fate of the city, and that means half the fate ofSoviet power in Russia. 
 There is no need for me to remind Petrograd workers and Red Army soldiers of their duty. 
 The entire history of thetwo years’ struggle of the Soviet Republic against the bour-geoisie of the whole world, a struggle of unprecedented dif-ficulty that has brought unprecedented victories, has demon-strated that the Petrograd workers are not only a model inthe fulfilment of their duty but have also shown examples ofthe greatest heroism and of revolutionary enthusiasm anddevotion such as the world has never before seen. 
 Comrades, the fate of Petrograd is being decided! The enemy is trying to catch us unawares. 
 His forces are weak,insignificant even, but he is strong because he is swift, because his officers are insolent and because he is well sup-plied and well armed. 
 Help for Petrograd is near at hand, we have sent reinforcements. 
 We are much stronger than the enemy. 
 Fight to the last drop of blood, comrades, hold fast toevery inch of land, be firm to the end, victory is near!Victory will be ours! V. 
 Ulyanov (Lenin ) October 17 Petrogradskaya Pravda No. 
 237, Published according to October 19, 1919 the manuscript TO THE RED ARMY MEN Comrades, Red Army men! The tsarist generals—Yude-nich in the North and Denikin in the South—are onceagain bending every effort in an attempt to vanquish So-viet power and restore the power of the tsar, the landownersand the capitalists. 
 We know how a similar attempt by Kolchak ended. 
 He did not succeed in deceiving the workers of the Urals and the peasants of Siberia for long. 
 Having seen through thedeception and having suffered endless violence, floggingsand robbery at the hands of the officers, the sons of land-owners and capitalists, the Ural workers and Siberian peas-ants helped our Red Army defeat Kolchak. 
 The Orenburg Cossacks came straight over to the side of Soviet power. 
 That is why we are fully confident in victory over Yudenich and Denikin. 
 They will not succeed in restoringthe power of the tsar and the landowners. 
 That will neverbe! The peasants are already rising in Denikin’s rear. 
 Theflames of revolt against Denikin are burning brightly in the Caucasus. 
 The Kuban Cossacks are grumbling and stir-ring to action, resentful of Denikin’s violence and robberyon behalf of the landowners and the British. 
 Let us then be firm, comrades, Red Army men! The workers and peasants are rallying ever more solidly, con-sciously and resolutely to the side of the Soviet government. 
 Forward, comrades, Red Army men, to the fight for the workers’ and peasants’ rule, against the landowners andthe tsarist generals! Victory will be ours! October 19, 1919 N. 
 Lenin Published in 1919 Published according to the manuscript RESULTS OF PARTY WEEK IN MOSCOW AND OUR TASKS During Party Week in Moscow, 13,600 people were enrolled in the Party. 
 This is a huge, quite unexpected success. 
 The entire bourgeoisie, and especially the urban petty bourgeoisie,including the specialists, officials and office workers wholament the loss of their privileged “ruling” position—allthese gentlemen have recently, particularly during Party Week in Moscow, been doing their best to sow panic and to prophesy the imminent collapse of Soviet power and theimminent victory of Denikin. 
 And with what consummate artistry this “intellectualist” public wields the weapon of sowing panic! And it has indeedbecome a real weapon in the class struggle of the bourgeoi-sie against the proletariat. 
 In periods such as the one we are passing through, the petty bourgeoisie merges in “onereactionary mass” with the bourgeoisie and “passionately”seizes on this weapon. 
 It is Moscow, where the trading element was especially strong, where there was a greater concentration of exploit-ers, landowners, capitalists and rentiers than anywhere else, where capitalist development brought together amass of bourgeois intellectuals, where the central stateadministration produced an especially large body of offici-als—it is Moscow that has furnished an exceptionally con-venient field for bourgeois tittle-tattle, bourgeois malicious talk and bourgeois panic-sowing. 
 The successful offensive of Denikin and Yudenich was a ‘factor” that favoured to anextraordinary extent the “successes” of this bourgeois weapon. 
 And yet, when the mass of the proletarians saw Denikin’s “successes” and realised all the difficulties, burdens and dangers attaching to the title and duties of a Communist at the present time, thousands and thousands of them roseup to reinforce the Party of Communists, to undertake theincredibly heavy burden of state administration. 
 The success of Soviet power, the success of our Party, is truly remarkable! This success has proved and vividly demonstrated to the people of the capital, and then to the whole Republic andthe whole world, that it is in the proletarian milieu, amongthe genuine representatives of the working people, thatthe most reliable source of the strength and durability ofSoviet power is to be found. 
 This successful voluntary enrolment in the Party at a time of maximum difficulty and danger is a real demonstration of that aspect of the dictatorship of the proletariat which its enemies, in theirmalice, refuse to see but which is valued above all by thereal friends of the emancipation of labour from the capi-talist yoke, namely, the special strength of the moral (in the best sense of the word) influence of the proletariat (which wields state power) on the masses, the ways this influence is exerted. 
 With state power in their hands, the foremost sections of the proletariat have by their example shown the massof the working people, shown them throughout two whole years (an immense period for our exceptionally rapid tempo of political development), a model of such devotion to the interests of the working people, such vigour in the struggleagainst the enemies of the working people (against theexploiters in general and against “property-owners” andprofiteers in particular), such firmness in difficult moments, such self-sacrificing resistance to the bandits of world imperialism, that the strength of the workers’ and peasants’sympathy for their vanguard has proved by itself capable of performing miracles . 
 It is indeed a miracle. 
 Workers, who have suffered unprecedented torments of hunger, cold, economic ruin and devastation, are not only maintaining their cheerful spirit, their entire devotion to Soviet power, all the energy ofself-sacrifice and heroism, but also, despite their lack of training and experience, are undertaking the burden of steering the ship of state! And this at a moment when the storm has reached the peak of its fury.... 
 The history of our proletarian revolution is full of such miracles. 
 They will lead, surely and inevitably, no matterwhat severe trials may be in store, to the full victory ofthe world Soviet republic. 
 We must take care now that proper use is made of the new Party members. 
 Particularly great attention must be devoted to this task, for it is not an easy one; it is anew task and cannot be accomplished by old routines. 
 Capitalism stifled, suppressed and killed a wealth of talent among the workers and working peasants. 
 Thesetalents perished under the oppression of want, poverty and the outrage of human dignity. 
 It is our duty now to bring out these talents and put them to work. 
 The new memberswho have joined the Party during Party Week are undoubt-edly for the most part inexperienced and ignorant inmatters of state administration. 
 Equally undoubtedlythese are most devoted, most sincere and capable people from the sections of society that capitalism artificially held down , reduced to the lowest level and did not allow to rise. 
 Among them, however, there is more strength, vigour, staunchness, directness and sincerity than amongother sections. 
 It follows that all Party organisations must give espe-cial thought to the employment of these new Party mem-bers. 
 They must be more boldly given the most varied kinds of state work, they must be tested in practice as rapidlyas possible. 
 Boldness, of course, must not be taken to mean that the new members are to be entrusted at once with responsible posts requiring knowledge they do not possess. 
 We must be bold in combating red tape not for nothing has our PartyProgramme very definitely raised the question of the causesof a certain revival of bureaucratic methods and indicatedmethods of combating it. 
 We must be bold in establishing,first of all, supervision over office workers, officials and specialists by new Party members who are well acquainted with the condition of the people, their needs and require-ments. 
 We must be bold in immediately affording these new members opportunities for developing and displaying their abilities in work on a broad scale . 
 We must be bold in breaking with customary routine (among us too—quite often, alas!—there is an excessive fear of encroaching onestablished Soviet routine, although sometimes the “estab-lishing” has been done not by class-conscious Communists,but by old officials and office workers); we must be boldin the sense that we must be prepared with revolutionary speed to alter the form of work for new Party members so as to test them more quickly and to find the appropriateplace for them. 
 In many cases new Party members can be given posts where, in the course of checking up the conscientiousnesswith which old officials perform their tasks, these Party members will quickly learn the job themselves and be able to take it over independently. 
 In other cases they can beplaced so as to renovate and refresh the intermediary linksbetween the mass of workers and peasants on the one hand,and the state apparatus on the other. 
 In our industrial“chief administrations and central boards”, in our agricultural “state farms” there are still many, far too many, saboteurs, landowners and capitalists in hiding, who harmSoviet power in every way. 
 Experienced Party workers inthe centre and the localities should show their efficiencythrough their ability to make intensive use of the new Partyforces for a determined fight against this evil. 
 The Soviet Republic must become a single armed camp where there is a maximum of effort, a maximum economyof forces, a maximum reduction of all red tape and un-necessary formalism and a maximum simplification of theapparatus which must be not only as close as possible tothe needs of the masses, but also something they can readily understand and participate in independently. 
 Increased mobilisation of old Party members for army work is taking place. 
 This activity must not be weakenedin any way, but more and more intensified. 
 At the sametime, however, and with the aim of achieving success inthe war, we must improve, simplify and revitalise our civil administration. 
 Victory in war goes to the side whose people has greater reserves, greater sources of strength and greater endurance. 
 We have more of all these qualities than the Whites, more than the “all-powerful” Anglo-French imperialism, this colossus with feet of clay. 
 We have more of them because we can draw, and for a long time will continue to draw,more and more deeply upon the workers and working peas-ants, upon those classes which were oppressed by capitalismand which everywhere form the overwhelming majorityof the population. 
 We can draw from this most capacious reservoir, for it gives us leaders of the workers and peasants in the building of socialism who are most sincere, themost steeled by the burdens of life, the closest to the work-ers and peasants. 
 Our enemies, whether the Russian or the world bourgeoi-sie, have nothing remotely resembling this reservoir; the ground is more and more giving way under their feet; they are being deserted by ever greater number of their formersupporters among the workers and peasants. 
 That is why, in the last analysis, the victory of Soviet power throughout the world is certain and inevitable.

) SPEECH TO STUDENTS OF THE SVERDLOV UNIVERSITY LEAVING FOR THE FRONT OCTOBER 24, 1919 Comrades, you know it is not only the desire to celebrate the completion of the course of instruction at the Sovietschool by the majority of you that has brought us heretogether, but also the decision taken by about a half thegraduates to leave for the front to render fresh, extraordinary and substantial aid to the troops in action there. 
 Comrades, we are well aware of the great difficulties being experienced by our entire administration in the townsand, especially, in the rural areas because of the shortageof experienced, knowledgeable comrades. 
 We are also wellaware that the advanced workers of Petrograd, Moscow, Ivanovo-Voznesensk and other towns, those advanced comrades who until now have been bearing what one mightcall the main burden of administering the country underunprecedentedly difficult conditions, who have been bear-ing the main burden of uniting the workers and peasantsand giving them guidance—we are well aware that these comrades are extremely exhausted by the superhuman efforts at times required of them for the defence of theSoviet Republic. 
 Therefore, the opportunity to gathertogether here several hundred workers and peasants andgive them the possibility of studying regularly for a fewmonths, to complete a course of Soviet studies and then leave here in a body, organised, mustered, politically-conscious to do the work of government and to make goodthe tremendous defects that still remain—such an oppor-tunity is of great value to us and it was with great difficulty and reluctance, and after considerable wavering that we took a decision to permit half the present graduation class to go to work at the front. 
 The conditions obtainingat the front, however, are such that we were left with noother choice. 
 And we were of the opinion that the decision,adopted voluntarily and for the purpose of dispatchingto the front a number of the best people who would have been valuable in all administrative and organising work— this decision was called for by circumstances of undoubtednecessity. 
 Comrades, permit me to give you a short review of the situation now obtaining on the various fronts so that youmay judge how urgent this necessity has become. 
 On a number of fronts that were formerly extremely important and on which the enemy had placed great hopes,victory for our side has recently drawn nearer and it will,by all the signs, be complete and irrevocable. 
 On the North-ern Front, where the offensive against Murmansk promisedthe enemy particularly great advantages and where the British had long ago mustered huge, excellently equipped forces and where we had unbelievable difficulty in fightingbecause of the lack of food and equipment—there, it seemed,the prospects for the British and French imperialistswere of the brightest. 
 It was there, however, that the enemyoffensive collapsed completely. 
 The British had to withdraw their troops, and we now have full confirmation that the British workers do not want war against Russia and evennow, when Britain is far from the revolutionary struggle,they are able to bring such pressure to bear on theirgovernment of predators and plunderers that they can forcethem to withdraw their troops from Russia. 
 They have been forced to abandon this front which was particularly dan-gerous because the enemy there was in possession of a searoute and was in a most favourable position. 
 There areRussian whiteguard forces of practically no significanceleft there. 
 Take another front—the Kolchak front. 
 You know that when Kolchak’s army advanced towards the Volga the capitalist press of Europe hurried to inform the wholeworld of the collapse of Soviet power and to recognise Kolchak as the Supreme Ruler of Russia. 
 Before the document announcing this recognition reached Kolchak, however, our troops had pushed him back into Siberia and, as you know, we approached Petropavlovsk and the River Irtyshand Kolchak was compelled to deploy his forces diffe-rently from the way he had intended. 
 Time was when wehad to withdraw because the local workers and peasantswere late in mustering their forces. 
 Information received from behind Kolchak’s lines tells of his undoubted debacle, and the population, even the affluent peasants, are risingagainst him to a man. 
 We are approaching the time whenthe last stronghold of Kolchak’s forces will be smashedand that will bring us to the end of a year of revolution inthe course of which all Siberia was under Kolchak’s rule and when he was helped by the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks who again went through the businessof coming to an agreement with a bourgeois government. 
You know that all the European bourgeoisie helped Kol-chak. 
 You know that the Siberian line was held by thePoles and Czechs, that there were also Italians there and American officer volunteers. 
 Everything that might paralyse the revolution came to the aid of Kolchak. 
 And it all col-lapsed because the peasants, the Siberian peasants, wholeast of all submit to the influence of communism becausethey see least of it, were given such a lesson by Kolchak,such a practical comparison (and peasants like practical comparisons) that we may say that Kolchak has given us a million supporters in districts the farthest removed fromindustrial centres where we should have had difficulty inwinning them over. 
 That is how Kolchak’s power cameto an end and that is why we feel our position to be moststable on that front. 
 We can see that the Polish offensive on the Western Front is coming to an end. 
 The Poles got help from Brit-ain, France and America who all tried to arouse Poland’sancient hatred towards her Great-Russian oppressors,tried to transfer the Polish workers’ hatred of the land-owners and tsars, a hundred times deserved, to the Russian workers and peasants, and tried to make the Polish workers think that the Bolsheviks, like the Russian chauvinists,dream of conquering Poland. 
 For the time being they were successful in this. 
 But there are definite signs that the time when this fraud was effective is now over and that disin-tegration has set in in the Polish army. 
 American reports that cannot be suspected of sympathy for communism affirmthat there is a growing demand among the Polish peasantsto finish the war by October I at all costs, and that thisdemand is supported by even the most patriotic of thePolish social-chauvinists (P. 
S. 
P. 
) 32 who occupy the same position as our Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries and are offering greater and greater opposition to theirgovernment. 
 In recent times the mood of the Poles haschanged considerably. 
 That leaves two other fronts, the Petrograd and South-ern fronts, where the most important events are taking place. 
 Here, too, all the signs indicate that the enemy is mustering his last forces. 
 We have precise information tothe effect that Secretary for War Churchill and the capi-talist party in Britain undertook this military ventureagainst Petrograd to demonstrate the possibility of makinga speedy end of Soviet Russia, and that the British press regards this venture as the last stake made by Mr. 
 Chur-chill and the chauvinists against the undoubted will ofthe majority of the people. 
 We may regard the Petrograd attack as a measure of help to Denikin; this conclusion may be drawn from thesituation on the Petrograd Front. 
 You know the Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian governments have agreed to our proposal to start peacenegotiations. 
 Naturally this last piece of news has causedsome wavering among our troops, giving them hopes thatthe war is drawing to an end. 
 The negotiations have begun. 
In the meantime Britain collected her remaining vessels and landed several thousand whiteguards equipped with magnificent war materiel. 
 They cannot transport themto us, however, unless they lull the people by deception,because in both Britain and France there have been casesof attempts to load war materiel on to ships having failedbecause the dockers struck work and said that they would not allow steamers carrying weapons of destruction to Soviet Russia to be loaded. 
 The British imperialists hadto get armaments from other countries, hoodwinking their own people. 
 No wonder, then, that they dispatched against Soviet Russia a few hundred or a few thousand Russian whiteguard officers. 
 There are camps in Britain where these whiteguard officers are housed, fed and trained for theinvasion of Russia; and then they say that this is an internalwar brought about by the terrorism of the Bolsheviks. 
Camps that were once full of Russian prisoners of war arenow full of Russian whiteguard officers. 
 This accounts for the tremendous successes achieved by the enemy when he brought these forces up to the Petrograd Front at a timewhen we were expecting Latvia and Lithuania to concludean armistice. 
 You now know that the turning-points has beenreached on the Petrograd Front. 
 You know from thereports of Zinoviev and Trotsky that losses have been made up, that the former wavering has come to an end and that our forces are attacking, and attacking successfully, over-coming the most desperate resistance. 
 These battles areoutstanding in their extraordinary ferocity. 
 Comrade Trotskyinformed me by telephone from Petrograd that in DetskoyeSelo, which we recently captured, whiteguards, and bour-geois who had remained behind, fired from individual houses, offering stubborn resistance, greater resistancethan in any previous battles. 
 The enemy feels that a turning-point has been reached in the entire war and that Denikinis in a position in which he must be helped and ourforces attacking him diverted. 
 It can be said definitely that they did not succeed in doing this. 
 Everything we sent to help Petrograd was obtained without the slightestweakening of the Southern Front. 
 Not a single unit forPetrograd was withdrawn from the Southern Front andthat victory which we have begun to achieve and which weshall pursue to the end will be achieved without any weak-ening of the Southern Front where the outcome of the war against the landowners and the imperialists is beingdecided. 
 That outcome will be there on the Southern Front,and in the near future. 
 Comrades, you know that on the Southern Front, on the one hand, the enemy relied mainly on the Cossacks who were fighting for their privileges, and on the other hand, more regiments of the volunteer army had been formed therethan elsewhere; these were troops full of savage resentment who fought for the interests of their class, for the restora-tion of the power of the landowners and capitalists. 
 It is here, therefore, that we have to engage them in the decisive battle, and here we see the same as we saw in the case ofKolchak; at first he achieved tremendous success, butthe longer the fighting went on, the thinner became theranks of the officers and politically-conscious kulaks whoformed the backbone of Kolchak’s army, and the more workers and peasants he had to enlist. 
 They like other people to do their fighting for them, they do not like makingsacrifices themselves and prefer that the workers risk theirnecks in their interests. 
 And when Kolchak had to expandhis army, the expansion led to hundreds of thousands comingover to our side. 
 Dozens of whiteguard officers and Cossacks who deserted to our side said that they had become con-vinced that Kolchak was selling Russia right and left,and although they did not share the views of the Bolsheviksthey came over to the side of the Red Army. 
 That is howKolchak finished up and that is how Denikin will end up,too. 
 Today you were able to read in the evening newspapers that there had been risings behind Denikin’s lines—the Ukraine is aflame. 
 We have reports of the events in theCaucasus where the mountain people, driven to despair,attacked Shkuro’s regiments and took their rifles andammunition away from them. 
 Yesterday we received aforeign wireless message that admitted that Denikin’s situation was a difficult one—he had been compelled to send his best forces into battle because the Ukraine wasaflame and there was an uprising in the Caucasus. 
 Thetime is coming when Denikin will have to stake everything. 
Never before have there been such ferocious, bloody battlesas that at Orel, where the enemy sent his best regiments, the so-called “Kornilov” regiments, into battle; one-third of them were the most counter-revolutionary officers, thebest trained and fiercest in their hatred of the workers andpeasants, officers who were defending the restoration oftheir own landowners’ rule. 
 That is why we have every reasonto believe that the decisive moment is approaching on the Southern Front. 
 The victories at Orel and Voronezh where the pursuit of the enemy continues, show that here, as onthe Petrograd Front, the turning-point has been reached. 
 We must ensure that our offensive will develop from a petty, partial attack into a gigantic mass offensive that will bring us the final victory. 
 That is why, no matter how great this sacrifice may be for us—the dispatch to the front of the hundreds of studentsgathered here and very obviously needed for work in Rus-sia—we have nevertheless granted you your wish. 
 There,on the Petrograd and Southern fronts, the fate of the war will be decided, if not in weeks, then at most in months. 
 At such a moment every politically-conscious Communistshould say to himself, “My place is there, ahead of theothers at the front, where every politically-conscious Com-munist who has graduated from this school is of value. 
” If there has been some wavering among the troops it is only because the people have become tired of war. 
 You are well aware of the hunger, ruination and torment that theworkers and peasants have endured during these two yearsof struggle against the imperialists of the whole world. 
You know that those suffering mostly from fatigue willnot stand up to the tension for long, and this is taken ad-vantage of by the enemy who has better communications, a better staff and no traitors, and he attacks in full force. 
This is the reason for our failures on the Southern Front. 
That is why the most politically-conscious of the workersand peasants, those who have had courses of military train-ing or courses similar to yours, must go to the front organ-ised and solid, dividing up into large or small groups as agreed upon by the military authorities, and distributingduties among themselves so as to help the troops amongwhom a certain instability is manifest and where the enemyis pressing most strongly. 
 Throughout the two years’ exis-tence of Soviet power, whenever a certain instability has made its appearance among the peasant masses who have never seen and do not know Soviet work, we have alwaysappealed to the more organised section of the urban prole-tariat for help and have received the most heroic supportfrom them. 
 Today I saw comrades from among the Ivanovo-Vozne-sensk workers who have allotted half the Party officials in responsible posts for dispatch to the front. 
 One of themtold me today of the enthusiasm with which tens of thous-ands of non-party workers saw them off; one old man, a non-party worker, came up to them and said, “Don’t worry, you may go, your place is there, we’ll work for you here. 
” When this mood makes itself apparent amongnon-party workers, when the non-party masses who arenot yet quite clear on political questions see that we aresending the best of the workers and peasants to the frontwhere they undertake the most difficult and most burden-some duties, duties of the greatest responsibility, where they will fight in the front ranks and make the greatestnumber of sacrifices, will die in desperate battles, then thenumber of our supporters among the less-developed non-party workers and peasants will increase tenfold andmiracles will occur among troops that are wavering, weak and tired. 
 That, comrades, is the magnificent, onerous and difficult task with which you are faced. 
 There is no choice for thosewho are leaving for the front as representatives of the work-ers and peasants. 
 Their slogan must be victory or death. 
Each of you must be able to approach the most backward, the least developed Red Army men in order to explain the situation to them in the most comprehensible language,from the standpoint of a man of labour, help them in amoment of difficulty, eliminate all wavering, teach themto fight against numerous manifestations of inertia, sabo-tage, deception or treachery. 
 You know that there are still many such manifestations in the ranks and among the com-manders. 
 Here people are needed who have been througha certain course of study, who understand the politicalsituation and are able to help the masses of workers andpeasants in their struggle against treachery and sabotage. 
Soviet power expects that you, in addition to displaying personal courage, will afford all-round help to those masses and so put an end to all wavering among them and showthem that Soviet power possesses forces to resort to in amoment of difficulty. 
 Those forces we possess in sufficientnumbers. 
 I repeat that we must now make this great sacrifice only because this is the main and the last front where, by all the signs, the fate of the whole Civil War will be decidedwithin the next few weeks or months. 
 Here we can once and for all deliver the enemy a blow that he will never recover from. 
 After this bloody struggle against the white-guards, a struggle that they imposed on us, we shall at last be able to get on with our own affairs, with realdevelopment, more freely and with redoubled energy. 
 Thatis why I greet those of you, comrades, who have taken uponyourselves the difficult and magnificent task of fighting tothe end in the ranks at the front, and I bid you farewell in the full confidence that you will bring us complete and final victory.

 240 and 241, Published according to October 26 and 28, 1919 the Pravda text TO COMRADE LORIOT AND ALL THE FRENCH FRIENDS WHO ADHERED TO THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL October 28, 1919 Dear Friend, I thank you with all my heart for your letter, which is the more precious because we very rarely receive any fromyou. 
 In France, as in England, victorious imperialism has not only enriched a certain number of small capitalists, but it has also been able to give alms to the upper grade of work-ers, the aristocracy of the working class, by throwing it afew crumbs from the imperialist exploit, won by the pillageof the colonies, and so on. 
 But the crisis caused by the war is so serious that even in the conquering countries the working masses are inev-itably condemned to appalling misery. 
 From this springsthe rapid growth of communism and the increasing move-ment of sympathy towards the Soviet power and towardsthe Third International. 
 It follows that you must maintain a long struggle still, especially with the very refined opportunists of the Longuet type; in the same way the experimenters and politi-cians will continue making effort after effort to make wordssuffice where it is a question of revolutionary tactics andof the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 In fact, they willcontinue to deceive the proletariat by means of new sub-terfuges, as Longuet, Merrheim and company did regarding the 21st of July. 
 They will adhere to their old opportunistpolicy which consists in hindering the revolution and in prejudicing it in all ways. 
 In France and in England the old rotten ( pourris ) leaders of the workers will make thous-ands of such attempts. 
 But we are sure that the Communists who are working in close contact with the proletarian masses will succeedin paralysing and in breaking these attempts. 
 The more theCommunists are firm and energetic in their attitude, thesooner they will gain a complete victory.

C. 
 OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF GERMANY October 28, 1919 Dear Friends I have forwarded to you for publication a letter dated October 10, 1919, “Greetings to French, Italian and German Communists”, in which I have referred, among other things, to your disagreements with the supporters of the boycott,the semi-syndicalists, etc. 
 Today I have learned from theGerman government wireless message (from Nauen) abouta split in your party: although the source is a filthy one,it is probably telling the truth in this case, because letters from our friends in Germany speak of the possibility of a split. 
 The only thing that seems incredible is this radio report that with 25 votes against 18, you expelled the minority, which, they tell us, then set up a party of its own. 
 I knowvery little about this breakaway opposition, for I have seen only a few issues of the Berlin Rote Fahne . 
 My impres-sion is that they are very gifted propagandists, inexperienced and young, like our own Left Communists (“Left” dueto lack of experience and youth) of 1918. 
 Given agreementon the basic issue (for Soviet rule, against bourgeois parlia-mentarism), unity, in my opinion, is possible and neces-sary, just as a split is necessary with the Kautskyites. 
 If the split was inevitable, efforts should be made not to deepenit, but to approach the Executive Committee of the Third International for mediation and to make the “Lefts” formulate their differences in theses and in a pamphlet. 
 Restoration of unity in the Communist Party of Germany is both possible and necessary from the international stand-point. 
 I would be extremely glad to get a letter from you onthis subject. 
 I am enclosing a letter to the breakawaygroup, and hope that you will forward it at the time ofpublishing my article, which, written before the news of the split was received, fully recognises the correctness of your standpoint. 
 A hearty handshake and warm wishes for success to you in your difficult work. 
 The communist movement is grow-ing splendidly throughout the world. 
 It is slower than wewould like, but broad, powerful, deep and invincible. 
 As was the case in Russia, the stage of the dominance of the “Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries” (of the SecondInternational) is discernible everywhere. 
 This dominancewill be succeeded by that of the Communists and the victoryof the dictatorship of the proletariat and of Soviet govern-ment.

 Lenin First published in 1932 Published according to the manuscript TO THE COMMUNIST COMRADES WHO BELONGED TO THE UNITED “COMMUNIST PARTY OF GERMANY ” AND HAVE NOW FORMED A NEW PARTY October 28, 1919 Dear Comrades, Only today have I learned of the split from the brief wireless message of the German Government (from Nauen). 
My article, “Greetings to French, Italian and GermanCommunists”, was written before the news of the split arrived. 
 In that article I tried, from the standpoint of interna-tional communism, to appraise your position, insofar as Icould acquaint myself with it in some issues of the BerlinRote Fahne . 
 I am convinced that the Communists who are agreed on the basic issue (the fight for the dictatorship of the proletariat and for Soviet government) and are impla-cably hostile to the Scheidemann and the Kautsky groupsin all nations, could and should have acted in unison. 
In my opinion, differences on less important issues can,and unfailingly will, vanish; this will result from the logicof the joint struggle against the really formidable enemy, the bourgeoisie, and its overt (Scheidemann) and covert (Kautsky) servitors. 
 I am not a member of the Executive Committee of the Third International, but I believe it will offer the GermanCommunists its good services in restoring German com-munist unity. 
 It is not surprising that the furious perse-cutions, which have made the Party illegal, impeded its work and hindered a proper exchange of ideas and theelaboration of common tactics. 
 A careful discussion of differences and an exchange of views on an international scale could assist in advancing the cause of German com-munism and in mustering its forces. 
 I shall be very glad if we manage to exchange opinions on these questions. 
 With communist greetings, N. 
 Lenin First published in the Published according to Fourth (Russian) Edition the manuscript of the Collected Works TO COMRADE SERRATI AND TO ALL ITALIAN COMMUNISTS October 28, 1919 Dear Friend, The news we get from Italy is extremely scanty. 
 It is only from the foreign (non-communist) press that we havelearned of your Party Congress at Bologna and of the splen-did victory of communism. 
 I send my heartfelt greetingsto you and all the Italian Communists, and wish you everysuccess. 
 The example of the Italian Party will be of enor-mous significance to the whole world. 
 In particular, the resolution of your Congress on participating in electionsto the bourgeois parliament is in my opinion perfectlycorrect, and I hope that it will help to achieve unity in theCommunist Party of Germany, which has just split on thisissue. 
 There is no doubt that the overt and the covert oppor-tunists, who are so numerous among the parliamentariansin the Italian Party, will try to circumvent and nullifythe Bologna resolutions. 
 The struggle against these trendsis by no means over, but the victory at Bologna willfacilitate further victories. 
 Difficult tasks lie ahead for the Italian proletariat owing to Italy’s position in the international field. 
 Britain andFrance, with the co-operation of the Italian bourgeoisie,may possibly try to provoke the Italian proletariat to apremature uprising in order the easier to crush it. 
 But theirprovocation will fail. 
 The brilliant work of the Italian Communists guarantees that they will be just as successful in winning the entire industrial and the entire rural pro-letariat plus the small peasants, and then, if the proper moment is chosen internationally, victory for the dictator-ship of the proletariat in Italy will be enduring. 
 That is also guaranteed by the successes of the Communists in France, Britain and throughout the world.

 (B) The dictatorship of the proletariat as the destruc-tion of bourgeois democracy and the creation ofproletarian democracy. 
 (C) The dictatorship of the proletariat and the distin-guishing features of imperialism (or the imperialist stage of capitalism). 
 (D) The dictatorship of the proletariat and Soviet power. 
 Plan for the elaboration of these 4 sections: I (A) THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT AS NEW FORMS OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE OF THE PROLETARIAT 1. 
 The chief reason why the “socialists” do not un-derstand the dictatorship of the proletariat is that they do not carry the idea of theclass struggle to its logicalconclusion (cf. 
 Marx,1852). 
 35 The dictatorship of the proletariat is the continuation of the class struggle of the proletariat in new forms. 
 That is the crux of the mat-ter, and that is what they do not understand. 
 The proletariat, as a spe-cial class, alone continues to wage its class struggle.

 Reduced First page of Lenin’s manuscript “Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat”. 
 October 30, 1919. 
 Reduced ECONOMICS AND POLITICS IN THE ERA OF THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT I had intended to write a short pamphlet on the subject indicated in the title on the occasion of the second anniver-sary of Soviet power. 
 But owing to the rush of everydaywork I have so far been unable to get beyond preliminarypreparations for some of the sections. 
 I have thereforedecided to essay a brief, summarised exposition of what,in my opinion, are the most essential ideas on the subject. 
 A summarised exposition, of course, possesses many disad-vantages and shortcomings. 
 Nevertheless, a short magazinearticle may perhaps achieve the modest aim in view, whichis to present the problem and the groundwork for its dis-cussion by the Communists of various countries. 
 1 Theoretically, there can be no doubt that between capi-talism and communism there lies a definite transition periodwhich must combine the features and properties of boththese forms of social economy. 
 This transition period has to be a period of struggle between dying capitalism and nascent communism—or, in other words, between capi-talism which has been defeated but not destroyed andcommunism which has been born but is still very feeble. 
 The necessity for a whole historical era distinguished by these transitional features should be obvious not only to Marxists, but to any educated person who is in any degree acquainted with the theory of development. 
 Yet allthe talk on the subject of the transition to socialism which /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR we hear from present-day petty-bourgeois democrats (and such, in spite of their spurious socialist label, are all the leaders of the Second International, including such indi-viduals as MacDonald, Jean Longuet, Kautsky and Fried-rich Adler) is marked by complete disregard of this obvioustruth. 
 Petty-bourgeois democrats are distinguished by anaversion to class struggle, by their dreams of avoiding it,by their efforts to smooth over, to reconcile, to remove sharp corners. 
 Such democrats, therefore, either avoid recognising any necessity for a whole historical period oftransition from capitalism to communism or regard it astheir duty to concoct schemes for reconciling the two con-tending forces instead of leading the struggle of one of theseforces. 
 2 In Russia, the dictatorship of the proletariat must inev-itably differ in certain particulars from what it would bein the advanced countries, owing to the very great back-wardness and petty-bourgeois character of our country. 
 But the basic forces—and the basic forms of social economy—are the same in Russia as in any capitalist country, so thatthe peculiarities can apply only to what is of lesser impor-tance. 
 The basic forms of social economy are capitalism, petty commodity production, and communism. 
 The basic forces are the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie (the peasantry inparticular) and the proletariat. 
 The economic system of Russia in the era of the dictator-ship of the proletariat represents the struggle of labour,united on communist principles on the scale of a vast state and making its first steps—the struggle against petty commodity production and against the capitalismwhich still persists and against that which is newly arisingon the basis of petty commodity production. 
 In Russia, labour is united communistically insofar as, first, private ownership of the means of production has been abolished, and, secondly, the proletarian state power is organising large-scale production on state-owned landand in state-owned enterprises on a national scale, is dis-tributing labour-power among the various branches of production and the various enterprises, and is distributing among the working people large quantities of articles of consumption belonging to the state. 
 We speak of “the first steps” of communism in Russia (it is also put that way in our Party Programme adopted inMarch 1919), because all these things have been only par-tially effected in our country, or, to put it differently, their achievement is only in its early stages. 
 We accom-plished instantly, at one revolutionary blow, all that can, ingeneral, be accomplished instantly; on the first day of thedictatorship of the proletariat, for instance, on October26 (November 8),1917, the private ownership of land wasabolished without compensation for the big landowners— the big landowners were expropriated. 
 Within the space of a few months practically all the big capitalists, ownersof factories, joint-stock companies, banks, railways,and so forth, were also expropriated without com-pensation. 
 The state organisation of large-scale productionin industry and the transition from “workers’ control” to “workers’ management” of factories and railways— this has, by and large, already been accomplished; but inrelation to agriculture it has only just begun (“state farms”,i. 
e. 
, large farms organised by the workers’ state on state-owned land). 
 Similarly, we have only just begun theorganisation of various forms of co-operative societies of small farmers as a transition from petty commodity agriculture to communist agriculture. 
 * The same must be said of the state-organised distribution of products in place-of privatetrade, i. 
e. 
, the state procurement and delivery of grain tothe cities and of industrial products to the countryside. 
Available statistical data on this subject will be given below. 
 Peasant farming continues to be petty commodity pro-duction. 
 Here we have an extremely broad and very sound,deep-rooted basis for capitalism, a basis on which capi-talism persists or arises anew in a bitter struggle against *The number of “state farms” and “agricultural communes” in Soviet Russia is, as far as is known, 3,536 and 1,961 respectively, andthe number of agricultural artels is 3,696. 
 Our Central StatisticalBoard is at present taking an exact census of all state farms and communes. 
 The results will begin coming in in November 1919. 
 communism. 
 The forms of this struggle are private spec-ulation and profiteering versus state procurement of grain (and other products) and state distribution of products in general. 
 3 To illustrate these abstract theoretical propositions, let us quote actual figures. 
 According to the figures of the People’s Commissariat of Food, state procurements of grain in Russia betweenAugust 1, 1917, and August 1, 1918, amounted to about30,000,000 poods, and in the following year to about110,000,000 poods. 
 During the first three months of the next campaign (1919-20) procurements will presumably total about 45,000,000 poods, as against 37,000,000 poodsfor the same period (August-October) in 1918. 
 These figures speak clearly of a slow but steady improve-ment in the state of affairs from the point of view ofthe victory of communism over capitalism. 
 This improve-ment is being achieved in spite of difficulties without world parallel, difficulties due to the Civil War organisedby Russian and foreign capitalists who are harnessing allthe forces of the world’s strongest powers. 
 Therefore, in spite of the lies and slanders of the bour-geoisie of all countries and of their open or masked henchmen (the “socialists” of the Second International), one thing remains beyond dispute—as far as the basic economicproblem of the dictatorship of the proletariat is concerned,the victory of communism over capitalism in our countryis assured. 
 Throughout the world the bourgeoisie is ragingand fuming against Bolshevism and is organising military expeditions, plots, etc. 
, against the Bolsheviks, because it realises full well that our success in reconstructing thesocial economy is inevitable, provided we are not crushedby military force. 
 And its attempts to crush us in thisway are not succeeding. 
 The extent to which we have already vanquished capi-talism in the short time we have had at our disposal, and despite the incredible difficulties under which we have hadto work, will be seen from the following summarised figures. 
 The Central Statistical Board has just prepared for the press data on the production and consumption of grain— not for the whole of Soviet Russia, but only for twenty-six gubernias.

6 gubernias) Thus, approximately half the amount of grain supplied to the cities is provided by the Commissariat of Food andthe other half by profiteers. 
 This same proportion is revealedby a careful survey, made in 1918, of the food consumed by city workers. 
 It should be borne in mind that for bread supplied by the state the worker pays one-ninth of what he pays the profiteer. 
 The profiteering price for bread isten times greater than the state price; this is revealed by a detailed study of workers’ budgets. 
 4 A careful study of the figures quoted shows that they present an exact picture of the fundamental features ofRussia’s present-day economy. 
 The working people have been emancipated from their age-old oppressors and exploiters, the landowners and capitalists. 
 This step in the direction of real freedom andreal equality, a step which for its extent, dimensions andProduction ofgrain (excludingseed and fodder),millions poods Commis-sariat offood Profiteers Total amount ofgrain at disposalof populationmillions poods Grain consump-tion, poods percapita rapidity is without parallel in the world, is ignored by the supporters of the bourgeoisie (including the petty-bourgeois democrats), who, when they talk of freedom and equality, mean parliamentary bourgeois democracy, whichthey falsely declare to be “democracy” in general, or “puredemocracy” (Kautsky). 
 But the working people are concerned only with real equality and real freedom (freedom from the landowners and capitalists), and that is why they give the Soviet government such solid support. 
 In this peasant country it was the peasantry as a whole who were the first to gain, who gained most, and gainedimmediately from the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
The peasant in Russia starved under the landowners and capitalists. 
 Throughout the long centuries of our history, the peasant never had an opportunity to work for himself:he starved while handing over hundreds of millions of poodsof grain to the capitalists, for the cities and for export. 
Under the dictatorship of the proletariat the peasant for the first time has been working for himself and feeding better than the city dweller . 
 For the first time the peasant has seen real freedom—freedom to eat his bread, freedomfrom starvation. 
 In the distribution of the land, as weknow, the maximum equality has been established; inthe vast majority of cases the peasants are dividing theland according to the number of “mouths to feed”. 
 Socialism means the abolition of classes. 
 In order to abolish classes it is necessary, first, to over-throw the landowners and capitalists. 
 This part of ourtask has been accomplished, but it is only a part, andmoreover, not the most difficult part. 
 In order to abolish classes it is necessary, secondly, to abolish the difference between factory worker and peasant, to make workers of all of them . 
 This cannot be done all at once. 
 This task is incomparably more difficult and will of necessity take along time. 
 It is not a problem that can be solved by over-throwing a class. 
 It can be solved only by the organisationalreconstruction of the whole social economy, by a transition from individual, disunited, petty commodity production to large-scale social production. 
 This transition must ofnecessity be extremely protracted. 
 It may only be delayed and complicated by hasty and incautious administrative and legislative measures. 
 It can be accelerated only by affording such assistance to the peasant as will enable him to effect an immense improvement in his whole farmingtechnique, to reform it radically. 
 In order to solve the second and most difficult part of the problem, the proletariat, after having defeated thebourgeoisie, must unswervingly conduct its policy towards the peasantry along the following fundamental lines. 
 The proletariat must separate, demarcate the working peasantfrom the peasant owner, the peasant worker from thepeasant huckster, the peasant who labours from the peasantwho profiteers. 
 In this demarcation lies the whole essence of socialism. 
 And it is not surprising that the socialists who are social-ists in word but petty-bourgeois democrats in deed (theMartovs, the Chernovs, the Kautskys and others) do notunderstand this essence of socialism. 
 The demarcation we here refer to is an extremely difficult one, because in real life all the features of the “peasant”, however diverse they may be, however contradictory they may be, are fused into one whole. 
 Nevertheless, demarcationis possible; and not only is it possible, it inevitably followsfrom the conditions of peasant farming and peasant life. 
The working peasant has for ages been oppressed by thelandowners, the capitalists, the hucksters and profiteers and by their state, including even the most democratic bourgeois republics. 
 Throughout the ages the workingpeasant has trained himself to hate and loathe theseoppressors and exploiters, and this “training”, engenderedby the conditions of life, compels the peasant to seek an alliance with the worker against the capitalist and against the profiteer and huckster. 
 Yet at the same time, economic conditions, the conditions of commodity production,inevitably turn the peasant (not always, but in the vastmajority of cases) into a huckster and profiteer. 
 The statistics quoted above reveal a striking difference between the working peasant and the peasant profiteer. 
 That peasant who during 1918-19 delivered to the hungry workers of the cities 40,000,000 poods of grain at fixedstate prices, who delivered this grain to the state agencies despite all the shortcomings of the latter, shortcomings fully realised by the workers’ government, but which were unavoidable in the first period of the transition to social-ism—that peasant is a working peasant, the comradeand equal of the socialist worker, his most faithful ally,his blood brother in the fight against the yoke of capital. 
Whereas that peasant who clandestinely sold 40,000,000poods of grain at ten times the state price, taking advan-tage of the need and hunger of the city worker, deceiving the state, and everywhere increasing and creating deceit,robbery and fraud—that peasant is a profiteer, an ally ofthe capitalist, a class enemy of the worker, an exploiter. 
For whoever possesses surplus grain gathered from landbelonging to the whole state with the help of implements in which in one way or another is embodied the labour not only of the peasant but also of the worker and so on—whoever possesses a surplus of grain and profiteers in thatgrain is an exploiter of the hungry worker. 
 You are violators of freedom, equality, and democracy— they shout at us on all sides, pointing to the inequality of the worker and the peasant under our Constitution, to the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, to the for-cible confiscation of surplus grain, and so forth. 
 We reply—never in the world has there been a state which has doneso much to remove the actual inequality, the actual lackof freedom from which the working peasant has been suffer-ing for centuries. 
 But we shall never recognise equality with the peasant profiteer, just as we do not recognise“equality” between the exploiter and the exploited, betweenthe sated and the hungry, nor the “freedom” for the formerto rob the latter. 
 And those educated people who refuseto recognise this difference we shall treat as whiteguards, even though they may call themselves democrats, socialists, internationalists, Kautskys, Chernovs, or Martovs. 
 5 Socialism means the abolition of classes. 
 The dictatorship of the proletariat has done all it could to abolish classes. 
But classes cannot be abolished at one stroke. 
 And classes still remain and will remain in the era of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 The dictatorship will become unnecessary when classes disappear. 
 Without the dictatorship of the proletariat they will not disappear. 
 Classes have remained, but in the era of the dictatorship of the proletariat every class has undergone a change, and the relations between the classes have also changed. 
The class struggle does not disappear under the dictatorship of the proletariat; it merely assumes different forms. 
 Under capitalism the proletariat was an oppressed class, a class which had been deprived of the means of production,the only class which stood directly and completely opposedto the bourgeoisie, and therefore the only one capable ofbeing revolutionary to the very end. 
 Having overthrown the bourgeoisie and conquered political power, the prole-tariat has become the ruling class; it wields state power, it exercises control over means of production already so-cialised; it guides the wavering and intermediary elementsand classes; it crushes the increasingly stubborn resistanceof the exploiters. 
 All these are specific tasks of the class struggle, tasks which the proletariat formerly did not and could not have set itself. 
 The class of exploiters, the landowners and capitalists, has not disappeared and cannot disappear all at once underthe dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 The exploiters havebeen smashed, but not destroyed. 
 They still have an inter-national base in the form of international capital, of which they are a branch. 
 They still retain certain means of pro-duction in part, they still have money, they still have vastsocial connections. 
 Because they have been defeated, theenergy of their resistance has increased a hundred -and a thousandfold. 
 The “art” of state, military and economic administration gives them a superiority, and a very great superiority, so that their importance is incomparablygreater than their numerical proportion of the population. 
The class struggle waged by the overthrown exploitersagainst the victorious vanguard of the exploited, i. 
e. 
, theproletariat, has become incomparably more bitter. 
 And it cannot be otherwise in the case of a revolution, unless this concept is replaced (as it is by all the heroes of theSecond International) by reformist illusions. 
 Lastly, the peasants, like the petty bourgeoisie in general, occupy a half-way, intermediate position even under the dictatorship of the proletariat: on the one hand, they are a fairly large (and in backward Russia, a vast) massof working people, united by the common interest of allworking people to emancipate themselves from thelandowner and the capitalist; on the other hand, they aredisunited small proprietors, property-owners and traders. 
 Such an economic position inevitably causes them to vacil-late between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. 
 In viewof the acute form which the struggle between these twoclasses has assumed, in view of the incredibly severe break-up of all social relations, and in view of the great attachmentof the peasants and the petty bourgeoisie generally to the old, the routine, and the unchanging, it is only natural that we should inevitably find them swinging from oneside to the other, that we should find them wavering,changeable, uncertain, and so on. 
 In relation to this class—or to these social elements— the proletariat must strive to establish its influence over it, to guide it. 
 To give leadership to the vacillating and unstable—such is the task of the proletariat. 
 If we compare all the basic forces or classes and their interrelations, as modified by the dictatorship of the pro-letariat, we shall realise how unutterably nonsensicaland theoretically stupid is the common petty-bourgeois idea shared by all representatives of the Second Interna-tional, that the transition to socialism is possible “by meansof democracy” in general. 
 The fundamental source of thiserror lies in the prejudice inherited from the bourgeoisiethat “democracy” is something absolute and above classes. 
As a matter of fact, democracy itself passes into an entirely new phase under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the class struggle rises to a higher level,dominating over each and every form. 
 General talk about freedom, equality and democracy is in fact but a blind repetition of concepts shaped by therelations of commodity production. 
 To attempt to solve the concrete problems of the dictatorship of the proletariat by such generalities is tantamount to accepting the theo-ries and principles of the bourgeoisie in their entirety. 
 From the point of view of the proletariat, the question can be put only in the following way: freedom from oppression by which class? equality of which class with which? democracy based on private property, or on a struggle forthe abolition of private property?— and so forth. 
 Long ago Engels in his Anti-Dühring explained that the concept “equality” is moulded from the relations of com-modity production; equality becomes a prejudice if it is not understood to mean the abolition of classes . 
 This ele-mentary truth regarding the distinction between the bour-geois-democratic and the socialist conception of equalityis constantly being forgotten. 
 But if it is not forgottenit becomes obvious that by overthrowing the bourgeoisiethe proletariat takes the most decisive step towards the abolition of classes, and that in order to complete the process the proletariat must continue its class struggle,making use of the apparatus of state power and employingvarious methods of combating, influencing and bringingpressure to bear on the overthrown bourgeoisie and thevacillating petty bourgeoisie.

 Lenin GREETINGS TO THE WORKERS OF PETROGRAD The workers of Petrograd deserve the first message of greeting on the occasion of the second anniversary of theSoviet Republic. 
 The Petrograd workers, as the vanguard of the revolutionary workers and soldiers, as the vanguard of the working people of Russia and the whole world, werethe first to overthrow the rule of the bourgeoisie and raisethe banner of the proletarian revolution against capitalismand imperialism. 
 For two years the workers and labouring peasants of the Soviet Republic have triumphantly held high that banner despite all difficulties and all the torments of hunger,cold, chaos and economic ruin. 
 Two years of socialist de-velopment have given us extensive experience, have enabledus to consolidate Soviet power despite the malicious furyand resistance of the bourgeoisie and the military attack by world imperialism. 
 On our side we have the sympathy of the world’s workers. 
 The proletarian revolution is maturing slowly and withdifficulty, but persistently in all countries, and the brutalviolence of the bourgeoisie only exacerbates the struggle,only hastens the victory of the proletariat. 
 Very recently the British reactionaries, the imperialists, made their last stake on the capture of Petrograd. 
 Thebourgeoisie of the entire world, especially the Russianbourgeoisie, already had a foretaste of victory. 
 But insteadof victory they met with defeat at Petrograd. 
 Yudenich’s forces have been beaten and are retreating. 
 Comrades, workers and Red Army soldiers! Bend all your efforts! Keep on the heels of the retreating troops at allcosts, crush them, do not allow them to rest for an hour, for a single minute. 
 At this moment we can and must strike harder than ever in order to finish off the enemy. 
 Long live the Red Army that is defeating the tsarist generals, whiteguards and capitalists! Long live the inter-national Soviet Republic! N.

 255, Published according to November 7, 1919 the manuscript SOVIET POWER AND THE STATUS OF WOMEN The second anniversary of Soviet power is an occasion for taking stock of what has been done during this period and for reflecting on the significance and the aims of the revolution that has been accomplished. 
 The bourgeoisie and its supporters charge us with having violated democracy. 
 We, on the other hand, assert thatthe Soviet revolution has given an unprecedented impulseto the development of democracy in breadth and in depth, democracy, that is, for the working people oppressed by capitalism, democracy for the overwhelming majority ofthe people, socialist democracy (for the working people),as distinct from bourgeois democracy (for the exploiters,for the capitalists, for the rich). 
 Who is right? To give proper thought to this question and achieve a deeper understanding of it one must take stock of the expe-rience of these two years and make better preparations forfurther development. 
 The status of women makes clear in the most striking fashion the difference between bourgeois and socialist democracy and furnishes a most effective reply to the ques-tion posed. 
 In a bourgeois republic (i. 
e. 
, where there is private ownership of land, factories, shares, etc. 
), be it the mostdemocratic republic, women have never had rights fullyequal to those of men, anywhere in the world , in any one of the more advanced countries . 
 And this despite the fact that more than 125 years have passed since the great French(bourgeois-democratic) Revolution. 
 In words bourgeois democracy promises equality and freedom, but in practice not a single bourgeois republic, even the more advanced, has granted women (half the human race) and men complete equality in the eyes of the law,or delivered women from dependence on and the oppressionof the male. 
 Bourgeois democracy is the democracy of pompous phrases, solemn words, lavish promises and high-sounding slogans about freedom and equality , but in practice all this cloaks the lack of freedom and the inequality of women,the lack of freedom and the inequality for the working andexploited people. 
 Soviet or socialist democracy sweeps away these pompous but false words and declares ruthless war on the hypocrisy of “democrats”, landowners, capitalists and farmers with bursting bins who are piling up wealth by selling surplusgrain to the starving workers at profiteering prices. 
 Down with this foul lie! There is no “equality”, nor can there be, of oppressed and oppressor, exploited and exploi-ter. 
 There is no real “freedom”, nor can there be, so long as women are handicapped by men’s legal privileges, so long as there is no freedom for the worker from the yokeof capital, no freedom for the labouring peasant from theyoke of the capitalist, landowner and merchant. 
 Let the liars and the hypocrites, the obtuse and the blind, the bourgeois and their supporters, try to deceive the people with talk about freedom in general, about equality in general and about democracy in general. 
 We say to the workers and peasants—tear the mask from these liars, open the eyes of the blind. 
 Ask them: Is there equality of the two sexes?Which nation is the equal of which? Which class is the equal of which? Freedom from what yoke or from the yoke of which class? Freedom for which class? He who speaks about politics, democracy and freedom,about equality, about socialism, without posing these questions, without giving them priority, who does not fight against hushing them up, concealing and blunting them, is the worst enemy of the working people, a wolfin sheep’s clothing, the rabid opponent of the workers and peasants, a lackey of the landowners, the tsars and the capitalists. 
 In the course of two years of Soviet power in one of the most backward countries of Europe more has been doneto emancipate woman, to make her the equal of the “strong”sex, than has been done during the past 130 years by allthe advanced, enlightened, “democratic” republics of theworld taken together. 
 Education, culture, civilisation, freedom—all these high-sounding words are accompanied in all the capitalist,bourgeois republics of the world with incredibly foul,disgustingly vile, bestially crude laws that make womenunequal in marriage and divorce, that make the child bornout of wedlock and the “legally born” child unequal and that give privileges to the male and humiliate and degrade womankind. 
 The yoke of capital, the oppression of “sacred private property”, the despotism of philistine obtuseness, theavarice of the small property-owner—these are the thingsthat have prevented the most democratic bourgeois republics from abolishing these foul and filthy laws. 
 The Soviet Republic, the republic of workers and peas-ants, wiped out these laws at one stroke and did not leavestanding a single stone of the edifice of bourgeois lies andbourgeois hypocrisy. 
 Down with this lie! Down with the liars who speak about freedom and equality for all , while there is an oppressed sex, oppressing classes, private ownership of capital andshares and people with bursting bins who use their surplusgrain to enslave the hungry. 
 Instead of freedom for all,instead of equality for all, let there be struggle against the oppressors and exploiters, let the opportunity to oppress and exploit be abolished . 
 That is our slogan! Freedom and equality for the oppressed sex!Freedom and equality for the workers and labouring peasants! Struggle against the oppressors, struggle against the capitalists, struggle against the kulak profiteers! This is our fighting slogan, this is our proletarian truth, the truth of the fight against capital, the truth that we hurlin the face of the world of capital with its honeyed, hypo-critical and pompous phrases about freedom and equality in general , about freedom and equality for all . 
 And it is because we have laid bare this hypocrisy, because, with revolutionary vigour, we are ensuring freedomand full rights for the oppressed working people, againstthe oppressors, against the capitalists, against the kulaks—precisely because of this Soviet rule has become so dear tothe workers of the whole world. 
 It is because of this, the sympathies of the working masses, the sympathies of the oppressed and exploitedin all countries of the world are with us on this occasionof the second anniversary of Soviet rule. 
 Because of this, on the occasion of the second anniver-sary of Soviet rule, despite the famine and cold, despite all the suffering caused by the imperialists’ invasion of the Russian Soviet Republic, we are fully convinced of thejustness of our cause, firmly convinced of the inevitablevictory of Soviet power on a world scale.

 Lenin TWO YEARS OF SOVIET POWER The newspaper Bednota45 is read mostly by peasants. 
 On this, the second, anniversary of the establishment of Soviet power, I wish to extend greetings to the many mil-lions of working peasants who have been liberated fromlandowner and capitalist oppression and say a few wordsabout that liberation. 
 Soviet power, which overthrew the rule of capital and placed power in the hands of the working people, has to contend in Russia with unparalleled and incredible difficul-ties. 
 The landowners and capitalists of Russia, now joined by the landowners and capitalists of the whole world, arestill making frenzied attempts to destroy Soviet power. 
 Theyfear the example it has set; they fear that it will win the sympathy and support of workers the world over. 
 Conspiracies within the country, the bribing of the Czech-oslovak forces, the landing of foreign troops in Siberia,Archangel, the Caucasus, South Russia and near Petrograd,the hundreds of millions of rubles being spent to help Kol-chak, Denikin, Yudenich and other tsarist generals—every conceivable method is being employed by the capitalists of all countries, who have accumulated millions and thou-sands of millions from war contracts, in an attempt tooverthrow the Soviet government. 
 But all in vain. 
 The Soviet government stands firm, overcoming all these unparalleled and incredible difficul-ties, despite the measureless suffering caused by war, blockade, famine, shortages, break-down of the transportsystem and general economic dislocation. 
 Soviet power in Russia has already won the support of the workers of the whole world . 
 There is not a single country where the people do not talk of Bolshevism and Soviet power. 
 The capitalists talk of it with hatred and rabid malice, slandering and vilifying it without end. 
 But this malicegives them away, and the mass of workers are turning theirbacks on the old leaders and coming out in support of Soviet power. 
 Despite the crushing, painful burden imposed by the enemy assault on Russia, Soviet power has triumphedthroughout the world—triumphed in the sense that every-where the sympathy of the working people is already onour side. 
 The victory of Soviet power throughout the world is assured. 
 It is only a question of time. 
 Why is Soviet power so firm and stable, despite the incredible ordeals, the terrible famine and the difficultiescreated by war and economic dislocation? Because it is the power of the working people themselves, of the millions of workers and peasants. 
 The workers hold state power. 
 The workers help the millions of labouring peasants. 
 The Soviet government has overthrown the landowners and capitalists and is steadfastly defending the peopleagainst attempts to restore their rule. 
 The Soviet government gives all the aid it is capable of to the labouring peasants , the poor and middle peasants , who make up the vast majority. 
 The Soviet government holds a tight rein on the kulak, the village money-bag, the proprietor, the profiteer, oneveryone who wants to get rich without having to work, everyone who battens on the misery and hunger of the people. 
 The Soviet government is for the labouring people, against the profiteers, proprietors, capitalists and landowners. 
 That is the source of the strength, stability and invin-cibility of Soviet power throughout the world. 
 Tens and hundreds of millions of workers and peasants all over the world are suffering oppression, humiliation and plunder at the hands of landowners and capitalists. 
 Theold state apparatus, whether of a monarchy or a “democratic” (pseudo-democratic) republic, helps the exploiters and oppresses the workers. 
 Tens and hundreds of millions of workers and peasants in all lands know this; they see it and experience it in theireveryday life. 
 The imperialist war lasted over four years, tens of mil-lions were killed and crippled. 
 What for? For the divisionof the capitalists’ spoils, for markets, profits, colonies and the power of the banks. 
 The Anglo-French imperialist predators defeated the German imperialist predators. 
 With every passing daythey are exposing themselves for what they are—robbersand plunderers, oppressors of the working folk who battenon the misery of the people and tyrannise weak nations. 
 That is why support for Soviet power is growing among the workers and peasants of the world. 
 The severe and arduous struggle against capital was victoriously begun in Russia. 
 It is now spreading in allcountries. 
 It will end in the victory of the World Soviet Republic.

 478, Published according to November 7, 1919 the Bednota text Signed: Lenin TWO YEARS OF SOVIET RULE SPEECH AT A JOINT SESSION OF THE ALL -RUSSIA CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, THE MOSCOW SOVIET OF WORKERS’ AND RED ARMY DEPUTIES, THE ALL -RUSSIA CENTRAL COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS, AND FACTORY COMMITTEES, ON THE OCCASION OF THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION NOVEMBER 7, 1919 Comrades, two years ago, when the imperialist war was still raging, it seemed to all the supporters of the bour-geoisie in Russia, to the masses of the people and, I dare say, to most of the workers in other countries, that theuprising of the Russian proletariat and their conquestof political power was a bold but hopeless enterprise. 
 Atthat time world imperialism appeared such a tremendous andinvincible force that it seemed stupid of the workers of a backward country to attempt to revolt against it. 
 Now, however, as we glance back over the past two years, wesee that even our opponents are increasingly admittingthat we were right. 
 We see that imperialism, which seemedsuch an insuperable colossus, has proved before the wholeworld to be a colossus with feet of clay, and the two years through which we have passed and during which we have had to fight, mark with ever-growing clarity the victorynot only of the Russian, but also of the internationalproletariat. 
 Comrades, during the first year of the existence of Soviet power we had to experience the might of German imperial-ism, to suffer the coercive and predatory peace that was forced on us; we were alone in issuing our call to revolution,and met with no support or response. 
 The first year of our rule was also the first year of our struggle against imperial-ism, and we soon became convinced that the struggle of the different parts of this gigantic international imperial-ism was nothing but its death throes, and that both Germanimperialism and the imperialism of the Anglo-Frenchbourgeoisie had an interest in this struggle. 
 During thatyear we established that this struggle only strengthened,only increased and restored our forces and enabled us to direct them against imperialism as a whole. 
 We created such a situation during the first year but, during the wholeof the second year, we stood face to face with our enemy. 
There were pessimists who even last year severely attackedus; even last year they said that Britain, France and Amer-ica were such a huge, such a colossal force that they would crush our country. 
 The year has passed, and as you see, while the first year may be called that of the might of inter-national imperialism, the second year will be called thatof the onslaught of Anglo-American imperialism and ofvictory over that onslaught, of victory over Kolchak andYudenich, and the beginning of victory over Denikin. 
 Now we know perfectly well that all the military forces sent against us have been directed from a definite source. 
We know that the imperialists have given them all themilitary supplies, all the arms needed; we know that theyhave handed over their global navies in part to our enemies,and now are doing all they can to help and build up forces both in the South of Russia and in Archangel. 
 But we know perfectly well that all these seemingly huge and invincibleforces of international imperialism are unreliable, andhold no terrors for us, that at the core they are rotten, thatthey are making us stronger and stronger, and that thisadded strength will enable us to win victory on the external front and to make it a thorough-going one. 
 I shall not dwell on this point as it will be dealt with by Comrade Trotsky. 
 It seems to me that we must now try to draw general lessons from the two years of heroic constructive work. 
 What, in my opinion, is the most important conclusion to be drawn from the two years of developing the Soviet Republic, what, in my view, is most important for us, is the lesson we have had in organising working-class power. 
It seems to me that in this we must not confine ourselves to the various concrete facts that concern the work of some commissariat and which most of you know of from your own experience. 
 It seems to me that, in glancing back over what we have gone through, we must draw a general lessonfrom this work of construction, a lesson that we shall learnand carry further afield among working people. 
 The lessonis that only workers’ participation in the general admin-istration of the state has enabled us to hold out amidst such incredible difficulties, and that only by following this path shall we achieve complete victory. 
 Another lessonto be drawn is that we must maintain the right attitudeto the peasantry, to the many millions of peasants, forthat attitude alone has made it possible for us to carry onsuccessfully amid all our difficulties, and it alone shows us the path along which we are achieving one success after another. 
 If you recall the past, if you recall the first steps of Soviet power, if you recall the entire work of developingall branches of the administration of the Republic, notexcluding the military branch, you will see that the estab-lishment of working-class rule two years ago, in October, was only the beginning. 
 Actually, at that time, themachinery of state power was not yet in our hands, and ifyou glance back over the two years that have since elapsedyou will agree with me that in each sphere—military,political and economic—we have had to win every position inch by inch, in order to establish real machinery of state power, sweeping aside those who before us had been at thehead of the industrial workers and working people ingeneral It is particularly important for us to understand the development that has taken place in this period, because there is development along the same lines all over the world. 
 The industrial workers and other working peopledo not take their first steps with their real leaders; theproletariat themselves are now taking over the administra-tion of state, political power, and at their head we seeeverywhere leaders who are destroying the old prejudices of petty-bourgeois democracy, old prejudices the vehicles of which in our country are the Mensheviks and Socialist-Rev-olutionaries, and throughout Europe are the representatives of bourgeois governments. 
 Previously this was an exception, now it has become the general rule. 
 Two years ago, in October, the bourgeois government in Russia— their alliance or coalition with the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries—was smashed, but we know how, in carry-ing on our work, we had subsequently to reorganise everybranch of administration in such a way that genuinerepresentatives, revolutionary workers, the vanguard of the proletariat, really took in hand the organisation of state power. 
 That was in October, two years ago, when the workwent on at terrific pressure, nevertheless we know, and wemust say it, that this work is not finished even now. 
 We knowhow those who formerly ran the state resisted us, howofficials at first tried refusing to administrate, but this gross sabotage was stopped in a few weeks by the prole-tarian government. 
 It showed that not the slightest impres-sion could be made on it by such refusal, and after we hadput an end to this gross sabotage this same enemy triedother methods. 
 Time and again it has happened that supporters of the bourgeoisie have been found even at the head of workers’ organisations; we had to get down to the business of makingthe fullest use of the workers’ strength. 
 Take, for example,what we experienced when the railway administration, therailway proletariat were headed by people who led themalong the bourgeois, and not the proletarian path. 
 46 W e know that in all spheres wherever we could get rid of the bourgeoisie, we did so, but at what a price! In each spherewe gained ground inch by inch, and promoted the best ofour workers, those who had gone through the hard schoolof organising the administration. 
 Viewed from the side,all this is, perhaps, not very difficult, but actually, if you go into the matter, you will see with what difficulty the workers, who had been through all the stages of the struggle,asserted their rights, how they set things going—fromworkers’ control to workers’ management of industry, orhow on the railways, beginning from the notorious Vikzhel, * they got an efficient organisation working; you will see *Vikzhel—All-Russia Executive Committee of the Railwaymen’s Trade Union. 
— Ed. 
 how representatives of the working class are gradually mak-ing their way into all our organisations and strengthening them by their activity. 
 Take the co-operatives, for example, where we see huge numbers of workers’ representatives. 
We know that formerly they consisted almost entirelyof non-working-class people. 
 Furthermore, in the oldco-operatives, there were people steeped in the views andinterests of the old bourgeois society. 
 In this respect the workers had to wage a long struggle before they could take power into their own hands and subordinate the co-opera-tives to their interests, before they could carry on morefruitful work. 
 But our most important work has been the reorganisa-tion of the old machinery of state, and although this has been a difficult job, over the last two years we have seen the results of the efforts of the working class and we cansay that in this sphere we have thousands of working-classrepresentatives who have been all through the fire of thestruggle, forcing out the representatives of bourgeois rulestep by step. 
 We see workers not only in state bodies; we see them in the food supply services, in the sphere that was controlled almost exclusively by representatives of theold bourgeois government, of the old bourgeois state. 
 Theworkers have created a food supply apparatus, and althougha year ago we could not yet fully cope with the work,although a year ago workers made up only 30 per cent of it, we now have as many as 80 per cent workers in the food supply organisations. 
 These simple and striking figuresexpress the step taken by our country, and for us theimportant thing is that we have achieved great results inorganising proletarian power after the political revolution. 
 Furthermore, the workers have done and are continuing to do the important job of producing proletarian leaders. 
 Tens and hundreds of thousands of valiant workers areemerging from our midst and are going into battle againstthe whiteguard generals. 
 Step by step we are gaining powerfrom our enemy; formerly workers were not very skilful inthis field, but we are now gradually winning area after area from our enemy, and there are no difficulties that can stop the proletariat. 
 The proletariat is gaining in every sphere,gradually, one after another, despite all difficulties, and is attracting representatives of the proletarian masses so that in every branch of administration, in every little unit, from top to bottom, representatives of the proletariat themselves go through the school of administration, andthen train tens and hundreds of thousands of people capableof independently conducting all the affairs of stateadministration, of building the state by their own efforts. 
 Comrades ! Lately we have witnessed a particularly bril-liant example of success in our work. 
 We know how widespread subbotniks have become among class-consciousworkers. 
 We know those representatives of communism whomost of all have suffered the torments of famine and bittercold, but whose contribution in the rear is no smaller thanthat of the Red Army at the front; we know how, at the critical moment when the enemy was advancing on Petrograd, and Denikin took Orel, when the bourgeoisiewere in high spirits and resorted to their last and favouriteweapon, the spreading of panic, we announced a Party Week. 
At that moment the worker Communists went to the indus-trial workers and other working people, to those who most of all had endured the burden of the imperialist war and were starving and freezing, to those on whom the bourgeoispanic-mongers counted most of all, to those who bore mostof the burden on their backs; it was to them that we addressedourselves during the Party Week and said: “You arescared by the burdens of working-class rule, by the threats of the imperialists and capitalists; you see our work and our difficulties; we appeal to you, and we open wide thedoors of our Party only to you, only to the representativesof the working people. 
 At this difficult moment we counton you and call you into our ranks there to undertake thewhole burden of building the state. 
” You know that it was a terribly difficult moment, both materially and because of the enemy’s successes in foreign policy and in the militarysphere. 
 And you know what unparalleled, unexpected andunbelievable success marked the end of this Party Weekin Moscow alone, where we got over 14 thousand new Partymembers. 
 There you have the result of the Party Week that is totally transforming, that is remaking the working class, and by the experience of work is turning those whowere the passive, inert instruments of the bourgeois government, the exploiters, and the bourgeois state into real creators of the future communist society. 
 We know that we have a reserve of tens and hundreds of thousands of working-class and peasant youths, those who saw and know to thefull the old oppression of landowner and bourgeois society,who have seen the unparalleled difficulties of our construc-tive work, who saw what heroes the first contingent ofParty functionaries proved to be in 1917 and 1918, who have been coming to us in bigger numbers and whose devotion is the greater the severer our difficulties. 
 Thesereserves give us confidence that in these two years we haveachieved a firm and sound cohesion and now possessa source from which we shall for a long time be able to drawstill more extensively, and so ensure that the working people themselves undertake to develop the state. 
 In this respect we have had such experience during these two yearsin applying working-class administration in all spheres,that we can say boldly and without any exaggeration thatnow all that remains is to continue what has been begun,and things will proceed as they have done these two years, but at an ever faster pace. 
 In another sphere, that of the relation of the working class to the peasantry, we have had far greater difficulties. 
Two years ago, in 1917, when power passed to the Soviets,the relation was still totally unclear. 
 The peasantry as awhole had already turned against the landowners, and supported the working class, because it saw they were ful-filling the wishes of the peasant masses, that they were realworking-class fighters, and not those who, in league withthe landowners, had betrayed the peasantry. 
 But we knowperfectly well that a struggle was only just beginning withinthe peasantry. 
 In the first year the urban proletariat still had no firm foothold in the countryside. 
 This is to be seen with particular clarity in those border regions where therule of the whiteguards was for a time consolidated. 
 Wesaw it last summer, in 1918, when they won easy victoriesin the Urals. 
 We saw that proletarian rule was not yetestablished in the countryside itself, and that it was not enough to introduce it from outside. 
 What was needed was that the peasantry should, by their own experience, bytheir own organisational work, arrive at the same conclusions, and although this work is immeasurably more difficult, slower and harder, it is incomparably more fruitful so far as results go. 
 This is our main achievement of the second year of Soviet rule. 
 I shall not speak of the military significance of our victory over Kolchak, but I shall say that had the peasantrynot undergone the experience of comparing the rule ofthe bourgeois dictators with that of the Bolsheviks, that victory would not have been won. 
 Yet the dictators began with a coalition, with a Constituent Assembly; in thatgovernment apparatus there participated the same Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks whom we meet at everystep in our work as the people of yesterday, as the peoplewho built co-operatives, trade unions, teachers’ organisa-tions and a host of other organisations which we have to reorganise. 
 Kolchak began in alliance with them, withindividuals for whom the Kerensky experiment was notenough—they undertook a second. 
 They did so in order toget the border regions, those farthest from the centre, torise against the Bolsheviks. 
 We could not give the peas-ants in Siberia what the revolution gave them in the rest of Russia. 
 In Siberia the peasants did not get landed estates,because there were none of them there, and that was whyit was easier for them to put faith in the whiteguards. 
 Allthe forces of the Entente and the imperialist army whichhad suffered least of all in the war, i. 
e. 
, the Japanese army, were drawn into the struggle. 
 We know that hundreds of millions of rubles were expended on assisting Kolchak,that all means were employed to support him. 
 Was thereanything he lacked on his side? He had everything. 
 Every-thing possessed by the strongest powers in the world, aswell as a peasantry and a huge territory almost devoid of an industrial proletariat. 
 What caused the destruction of all this? The fact that the experience of the workers, sol-diers and peasants showed once again that the Bolshevikswere right in their forecasts, in their appraisal of the rela-tion of social forces, when they said that the alliance ofthe workers and peasants is effected with difficulty, but that at any rate it is the only invincible alliance against the capitalists. 
 This is science, comrades, if one may use that term here. 
 This experience is one of the greatest difficulty, one that takes account of everything and consolidates everything— it is the experience of communism; we can only establishcommunism if the peasantry arrive consciously at a definiteconclusion. 
 We can do this only when we enter into alliancewith the peasants. 
 We were able to convince ourselves ofthis by the Kolchak experience. 
 The Kolchak revolt was an experience of great bloodshed, but that was no fault of ours. 
 You are now perfectly familiar with the second trouble that afflicts us; you know that famine and cold have affectedour country more severely than any other. 
 You know thatthe blame for this is thrown on communism, but you alsoknow perfectly well that communism has nothing to do with it. 
 In all countries we see increasing and growing famine and cold and soon everybody will be convinced thatthis situation in Russia is not the consequence of commu-nism, but of four years of world-wide war. 
 It is the war thathas caused all the horror we are enduring, that has causedthis famine and cold. 
 But we believe that we shall soon emerge from this state of affairs. 
 The whole problem is only that the workers must work, but work for themselvesand not for those who for four years have been engaged inthroat-cutting. 
 As for the fight against famine and cold,it is going on everywhere. 
 The most powerful states arenow subject to this affliction. 
 We have had to resort to state requisitioning to collect grain from the many millions of our peasantry, and havedone so not the way it was done by the capitalists, whooperated along with the profiteers. 
 In settling this problemwe went with the workers, we went against the profiteers. 
We used the method of persuasion, we went to the peas-antry and told them that all we were doing was in support of them and the workers. 
 The peasant who has a grain sur-plus and delivers it to us at a fixed price, is our ally. 
 Theone, however, who does not do so is our enemy, is a criminal,is an exploiter and profiteer, and we can have nothing incommon with him. 
 We went with a message to the peasant, and this message has increasingly drawn the peasantry to our side. 
 We have got quite definite results in this field. 
Between August and October of last year we procured 37 million poods of grain, but this year we have procured 45 million poods, and that without undertaking a special and careful check. 
 An improvement, as you see, is taking place, a slow but undoubted one. 
 And even if we reckon withthe gaps made by Denikin’s occupation of our fertile region,there are nevertheless signs of our being able to carrythrough our plan of procurement and plan of distribution atstate prices. 
 In this respect, too, our machinery has in a sense become established, and we are now taking the socialist path. 
 Now we are faced with the problem of a fuel crisis. 
 The grain problem is no longer so acute; the position is that wehave grain, but have no fuel. 
 We have been deprived ofour coal-field by Denikin. 
 The loss of this coal-field has brought us unprecedented difficulties, and in this case we are doing just what we did in relation to grain. 
 As wedid previously we are again addressing ourselves to theworkers. 
 In the same way as we reorganised our food supplymachinery, which, after being strengthened and set going,fulfilled quite a definite job that has yielded splendid results, so we are now improving our fuel supply machinery day by day. 
 We are telling the workers from what directionthis or that danger is advancing on us, in which directionand from what region we must send new forces, and we areconfident that, just as we conquered our grain difficultieslast year, so now we shall conquer our fuel difficulties. 
 Allow me for the moment to confine myself to this sum-mary of our work. 
 In conclusion, I shall take the libertyof saying just a few words about how our internationalsituation is improving. 
 We have examined the path wehave followed, and the results show that our path has beenthe right and proper one. 
 When we took power in 1917, we were alone. 
 In 1917 it was said in all countries that Bolshe-vism could not take root. 
 Now there is a powerful communistmovement in those same countries. 
 In the second yearafter we conquered power, six months after we founded theThird International, the Communist International, thisInternational has in fact become the main force in the labour movement of all countries. 
 In this respect the expe-rience we have undergone has yielded the most splendid,unparalleled and rapid results, True, the movement to freedom in Europe is not proceeding in the same way as in our country. 
 But if you recall our two years of struggle, you will see that in the Ukraine too, and even in some parts of Russia proper, where the population was of a specific com-position—for instance, in the Cossack and Siberian areas,or in the Urals—the movement to victory was not so rapidand did not follow the same road as in Petrograd andin Moscow, in the heart of Russia. 
 Of course, we cannot be surprised at the slower pace of the movement in Europe, where pressure of jingoism and imperialism that has to besurmounted is greater; nonetheless the movement is proceed-ing unswervingly, along the very road being indicated bythe Bolsheviks. 
 Everywhere we are witnessing this forwardmovement. 
 The mouthpieces of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries are yielding place everywhere to representatives of the Third International. 
 The old leadersare falling, and the communist movement has risen every-where, and that is why, after two years of Soviet rule,we can say, supported by the facts, we have every rightto say, that not only on the scale of the Russian state, but also on an international scale we now have the following of all the politically conscious, all that are revolutionaryamong the masses, in the revolutionary world. 
 And we cansay that after what we have endured no difficulties holdany terrors for us, that we shall withstand all these difficul-ties, and then conquer them all.

 251, Published according to November 9, 1919 the verbatim report, verified with the Pravda text TO THE COMMUNIST S OF TURKESTA N47 Comrades, permit me to address you not as Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council of Defence, but as a member of the Party. 
 It is no exaggeration to say that the establishment of proper relations with the peoples of Turkestan is now of immense, epochal importance for the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. 
 The attitude of the Soviet Workers’ and Peasants’ Republic to the weak and hitherto oppressed nations is ofvery practical significance for the whole of Asia and for allthe colonies of the world, for thousands and millions of people. 
 I earnestly urge you to devote the closest attention to this question, to exert every effort to set an effective example of comradely relations with the peoples of Turkestan, todemonstrate to them by your actions that we are sincerein our desire to wipe out all traces of Great-Russian impe-rialism and wage an implacable struggle against world imperialism, headed by British imperialism. 
 You shouldshow the greatest confidence in our Turkestan Commis-sion and adhere strictly to its directives, which have beenframed precisely in this spirit by the All-Russia CentralExecutive Committee. 
 I would very much appreciate a reply to this letter indicating your attitude. 
 With communist greetings, V. 
 Ulyanov (Lenin ) Turkestansky Kommunist , Published according to Izvestia TsIK Sovetov the newspaper text Turkestanskoi Respubliki and Krasny Front (jubilee edition), November 7-10, 1919 THE FIGHT TO OVERCOME THE FUEL CRISIS CIRCULAR LETTER TO PARTY ORGANISATIONS48 Comrades, to our Party, as the organised vanguard of the proletariat, has fallen the duty of uniting the working class in its struggle and of leading it in the fight for thevictory of the workers’ and peasants’ Soviet power. 
 Wehave carried on that fight triumphantly for two years andnow know by what means we succeeded in overcomingthe incredible difficulties placed in our way by the impoverishment of the country that resulted from four years of imperialist war and the resistance of all exploiters,Russian and international. 
 Comrades, the chief source of our strength is the class-consciousness and heroism of the workers, who had, andstill have, the sympathies and support of the labouring peasants. 
 Our victories were due to the direct appeal made by our Party and by the Soviet government to the workingmasses, with every new difficulty and problem pointedout as it arose; to our ability to explain to the masses whyit was necessary to devote all energies first to one, then toanother aspect of Soviet work at a given moment; to our ability to arouse the energy, heroism and enthusiasm of the masses and to concentrate every ounce of revolutionaryeffort on the most important task of the hour. 
 Comrades, at this juncture the most important task of the hour is the struggle to overcome the fuel crisis. 
 Weare finishing off Kolchak, we have vanquished Yudenich, we have begun a successful offensive against Denikin. 
 We have considerably improved matters as regards the procure-ment and storage of grain. 
 But the fuel crisis threatens to disrupt all Soviet work: factory workers and office employees are abandoning their jobs to escape cold and hunger, trains carrying grain are brought to a standstill, and veritable disaster is impending precisely on account ofthe fuel shortage. 
 The fuel problem has become the central problem. 
 The fuel crisis must be overcome at all costs, otherwise it willbe impossible to solve the food problem, or the war problem, or the general economic problem. 
 And the fuel crisis can be overcome. 
 For although we have lost the coal of the Donets Basin, and although we arenot in a position rapidly to increase the output of coal inthe Urals and Siberia, we still have plenty of forests andwe can cut and deliver a sufficient quantity of wood. 
 The fuel crisis can be overcome. 
 The thing now is to concentrate our main forces against what is (at present)our main enemy: the fuel shortage. 
 We must arouse enthu-siasm in the working masses and achieve a revolutionaryharnessing of energies for the swiftest possible procurementand delivery of the largest possible quantity of fuel of every kind—coal, shale, peat, etc. 
, and in the first place wood, wood and wood. 
 The Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party is confident that all Party organisations and all Partymembers, who in the past two years have demonstratedtheir capacity and ability to solve problems no less and even more difficult in a revolutionary way, will solve this problem too. 
 The Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party proposes in particular the following measures to all Partyorganisations: 1. 
 All Party organisations must henceforth make the fuel problem and measures to combat the fuel crisis a per-manent item on the agenda of Party meetings and espe-cially meetings of Party committees. 
 What more can bedone, what must be done to combat the fuel crisis, how canthe work be intensified, how can it be made more produc-tive?—let these questions now occupy the attention of all Party organisations. 
 2. 
 The same applies to all gubernia, city, uyezd and volost executive committees—in a word, to all leading Soviet bodies. 
 Party people must assume the initiative in strengthening, co-ordinating and intensifying the work on a country-wide scale. 
 3. 
 The widest possible propaganda must be carried on everywhere, especially in the countryside, to explain whatthe fuel problem means to the Soviet state. 
 In particular,local, parochial, narrow egoistical interests in the matterof fuel supplies must be combated. 
 It must be explained that without devoted effort to meet the general need of the state it will be impossible to save the Soviet Republic,to uphold the power of the peasants and workers. 
 4. 
 The most careful supervision must be exercised over the way the assignments of the Party and the instructions,demands and commissions of the Soviet government are carried out. 
 New members of the Party who joined during the last Party Week should all be enlisted in the workof checking up on the way everyone is performing hisduties. 
 5. 
 Labour conscription for the whole population must be carried out, or certain age categories must be mobilised as quickly as possible and in the most imperative fashion for the work of procuring and carting coal and shale orcutting wood and carting it to the railway station. 
 Fixlabour quotas and see that they are carried out at all costs. 
Punish with ruthless severity those who despite repeatedinsistence, demands and orders are found to have shirked the work. 
 Any lenience or weakness will be a crime against the revolution. 
 We have improved discipline in the army. 
 We must also improve labour discipline. 
 6. 
 Subbotniks must be arranged more frequently, ener-getically and systematically, and must be better organised, primarily for fuel work. 
 Party members must set an example to all in labour discipline and energy. 
 Decisions of theCouncil of People’s Commissars, of the Council of Defenceand of other central and also local Soviet bodies on thefuel question must be carried out conscientiously andscrupulously. 
 7. 
 Local fuel bodies must be reinforced with the best of the Party workers. 
 For this purpose the distribution offorces should be revised and appropriate changes made. 
 8. 
 Comrades sent from the centre must be given the utmost assistance and the largest possible number of young people must be trained—and practically trained at that— in organising, arranging and maintaining fuel work. 
 Thelocal press must devote more attention to this work andmust take pains to bring to public attention examples ofreally fine work and wage an implacable campaign againstbackwardness, lack of zeal or lack of ability displayed by any particular district, department or institution. 
 Our press must become an instrument for bringing the backwardinto line and for inculcating industry, labour disciplineand organisation. 
 9. 
 The chief task of the food bodies must be to supply food and fodder for those engaged on fuel supply work. 
 They must be given every assistance, their work must be intensified, and a check kept on the way it is carried out. 
 10. 
 Indefatigable efforts must be made to ensure that in every fuel body (as in every Soviet institution generally)everyone is held personally responsible for a definite, strictly and precisely defined job or part of a job. 
 Committee dis-cussion must be reduced to an absolute minimum and never be allowed to interfere with swiftness and firmness of decisionor minimise the responsibility of each and every worker. 
 11. 
 The clerical work connected with fuel matters must be particularly prompt and accurate. 
 The slightest tendencytowards red tape must be punished ruthlessly. 
 Reporting to the centre must be put on exemplary lines. 
 12. 
 All fuel work in general must be organised in mili-tary fashion, with the energy, speed and strict dis-cipline that is demanded in war. 
 Without that we shall neverovercome the fuel shortage. 
 Without it we shall not escapefrom the crisis. 
 The Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party is confident that all comrades will bend every effort tocarry out these instructions energetically and faithfully. 
 The fuel shortage must be fought and overcome! Central Committee, Russian Communist Party Pravda No. 
 254, Published according to November 13, 1919 the Pravda text, verified with the manuscript SPEEC H DELIVERE D AT THE FIRST ALL-RUSSI A CONFERENCE ON PARTY WOR K IN THE COUNTRYSID E49 NOVEMBER 18, 1919 Comrades, unfortunately I have not been able to take part in the conference you have arranged, that is, in thisconference on work in the countryside. 
 Hence I shall haveto limit myself to some general, basic considerations, and I am certain that you will be able gradually to apply these general considerations and fundamental principles of ourpolicy to the various tasks and practical questions thatcome up before you. 
 The question of our work in the countryside is now, strictly speaking, the basic question of socialist construc-tion in general, for insofar as the work among the prole-tariat and the question of uniting its forces are concerned,we can safely say that during the two years of Soviet powercommunist policy has not only taken definite shape buthas unquestionably achieved lasting results. 
 At first wehad to fight a lack of understanding of the common interests among the workers, to fight various manifestations of syn-dicalism when the workers of some factories or somebranches of industry tended to place their own interests, theinterests of their factory or industry, above the interestsof society. 
 We had to fight a lack of discipline in the neworganisation of labour, and still have to. 
 I believe you all remember the major stages through which our policy has passed, when, as we promoted more and more workersto new posts, we gave them an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the tasks facing us, with the general mechanism of government. 
 The organisation of the communist activity of the proletariat and the entire policy of the Communists have now acquired a final, lasting form; I amcertain that we are on the right path and that progress alongthat path is fully ensured. 
 As regards work in the countryside, the difficulties here are undoubtedly great, and we gave this question full consideration at the Eighth Congress of the Party 50 as one of the most important issues. 
 In the countryside as wellas in the towns we can rely only on the working andexploited people, only on those who, under capitalism, borethe whole burden of the landowner and capitalist yoke. 
Since the time when the conquest of power by the workers abolished private property and enabled the peasants to sweep away the power of the landowners at one blow, theydivided up the land and, of course, gave effect to the fullestequality and thus considerably improved the exploitationof the soil, raising it to a level above the average. 
 It goeswithout saying, however, that we could not achieve every-thing we would have wished in this respect, for it would take tremendous funds to provide each with sufficient seed,livestock and implements as long as the land is tilled byindividual peasants. 
 Moreover, even if our industry wereto achieve extraordinary progress and increase the pro-duction of agricultural machines, even if we were to imagine all our wishes fulfilled, it would still be obvious that to supply each small peasant with sufficient means of pro-duction is impossible and most irrational since it wouldmean a terrible fragmentation of resources; only joint,artel, co-operative labour can help us to emerge from theblind alley in which the imperialist war has driven us. 
 In the mass, the peasants, whose economic position under capitalism made them the most downtrodden, findit hardest of all to believe in the possibility of sharp changesand transitions. 
 The peasant’s experience of Kolchak,Yudenich, and Denikin compels him to show especial con-cern about his gains. 
 All peasants know that the permanence of their gains is not finally guaranteed, that their enemy— the landowner—has not yet been destroyed, but has goneinto hiding and is waiting for his friends, the international capitalist brigands, to come to his aid. 
 And although international capital is becoming weaker day by day and our international position has greatly improved in the recent period, if we soberly weigh all the circumstances, we haveto admit that international capital is still undoubtedlystronger than we are. 
 It no longer can openly wage waragainst us—its wings have already been clipped. 
 Indeed,all these gentlemen in the European bourgeois press have latterly begun to say, “You are likely to get bogged down in Russia, perhaps it is better to make peace with her. 
”That is the way it always is—when the enemy is beaten,he begins talking peace. 
 Time and again we have toldthese gentlemen, the imperialists of Europe, that we agreeto make peace, but they continued to dream of enslaving Russia. 
 Now they realise that their dreams are not fated to come true. 
 The international millionaires and multimillionaires are still stronger than we are. 
 And the peasants see per-fectly well that the attempts to seize power by Yudenich,Kolchak, and Denikin were financed by the imperialists of Europe and America. 
 And the mass of the peasants know very well what the slightest weakness will cost them. 
 Thevivid memory of the rule of the landowners and capitalistsmakes the peasants reliable supporters of Soviet power. 
With each passing month Soviet power becomes more stableand there is growing political consciousness among the peasants who formerly laboured and were exploited and who themselves experienced the full weight of the landownerand capitalist yoke. 
 Things, of course, are different with the kulaks, with those who hired workers, made money by usury, andenriched themselves at the expense of the labour of others. 
 Most of these side with the capitalists and are opposed to the revolution that has taken place. 
 We must clearlyrealise that we still have a long and stubborn fight to wageagainst this group of peasants. 
 Between the peasants whoshouldered the full load of the landowner and capitalistyoke and those who exploited others there is, however, a mass of middle peasants. 
 Here lies our most difficult task. 
 Socialists have always pointed out that the transitionto socialism will raise this difficult problem—the attitude of the working class to the middle peasantry. 
 Here it is to be expected that Communists, more than anyone else, will show a serious understanding and intelligent approach to this complicated and difficult task, and will not try to solveit at one stroke. 
 The middle peasants are undoubtedly accustomed to farming each for himself. 
 They are peasant proprietors,and although they have no land as yet, although private property in land has been abolished, they remain proprie-tors, primarily because this group of peasants remain inpossession of food products. 
 The middle peasant producesmore food than he needs for himself, and since he has sur-plus grain he becomes the exploiter of the hungry worker. 
Herein lies the main task and the main contradiction. 
 The peasant as a working man, as a man who lives by his own labour, as one who has borne the yoke of capitalism, sideswith the worker. 
 But the peasant as a proprietor with a sur-plus of grain is accustomed to regarding it as his propertywhich he can sell freely. 
 Anyone who sells grain surplusesin a hunger-ridden country becomes a profiteer, an exploiter, because the starving man will give everything he has for bread. 
 It is here that the biggest and hardest battle has to befought, a battle which demands of all of us representativesof Soviet power, and especially the Communists working inthe countryside, the greatest attention and most seriousthought to the issue in hand and the way to approach it. 
 We have always said that we do not seek to force social-ism on the middle peasant, and the Eighth Party Congressfully confirmed this. 
 The election of Comrade Kalinin asChairman of the All-Russia Central Executive Committeewas prompted by the need to build the closest of bondsbetween Soviet power and the peasantry. 
 Thanks to Comrade Kalinin our work in the countryside has gained considerable momentum. 
 The peasant is now undoubtedly in a positionto keep in closer contact with the Soviet government throughComrade Kalinin, who represents the supreme authorityof the Soviet Republic. 
 In this way we said in effect tothe middle peasant: “There can be no question of forcibly imposing socialism on anyone. 
” But we must make him under-stand this, we must know how to tell him this in a languagethe peasant understands best of all. 
 Here we must rely only on the force of example, successfully organised socialised farming. 
 To give an example of artel, co-operative labour we must first achieve success in organising such farming ourselves. 
 In these past two years the movement to set upagricultural communes and co-operatives has acquired tre-mendous scope. 
 Looking at things soberly, however, we mustsay that a great many of the comrades who tackled theorganisation of communes started to farm without sufficient knowledge of the economic conditions of peasant life. 
 Undue haste and wrong approach to the question led to a tremen-dous number of mistakes which have had to be rectified. 
Time and again the old exploiters, former landowners,wormed their way into state farms. 
 They no longer dominatethere, but they have not been eliminated. 
 It is necessary either to squeeze them out or put them under the control of the proletariat. 
 This is a task that confronts us in all spheres of life. 
 You have heard of the series of brilliant victories won by theRed Army. 
 There are tens of thousands of old colonels andofficers of other ranks in that army and if we had not accept-ed them in our service and made them serve us, we could not have created an army, And despite the treachery ofsome military specialists, we have defeated Kolchak andYudenich, and are winning on all fronts. 
 The reason forthis is the existence of communist cells in the Red Army;they conduct propaganda and agitation carrying a tremen-dous impact, and thanks to them the small number of old officers find themselves in such an environment, under sucha tremendous pressure from the Communists, that the major-ity of them are unable to break out of the communist organ-isation and propaganda with which we have surroundedthem. 
 Communism cannot be built without knowledge, technique, and culture, and this knowledge is in possession of bour-geois specialists. 
 Most of them do not sympathise withSoviet power, yet without them we cannot build communism. 
They must be surrounded with an atmosphere of comradeship,a spirit of communist work, and won over to the side of the workers’ and peasants’ government. 
 Among the peasants there have been frequent manifes-tations of extreme distrust and resentment of state farms, even complete rejection of them; we do not want state farms, they say, for the old exploiters are to be found there. 
 We have told them—if you are unable to organise farming along new lines yourselves, you have to employ the services ofold specialists; otherwise there is no way out of poverty. 
We shall weed out old experts who violate the decisions ofthe Soviet government as ruthlessly as we do in the RedArmy; the struggle goes on, and it is a struggle without mercy. 
 But we shall force the majority of the experts to work as we want them to. 
 This is a difficult, complex task, a task that cannot be solved at one blow. 
 Here conscious working-class disciplineand closer contact with the peasants are needed. 
 The peasantsmust be shown that we are not blind to any of the abuses on the state farms, but at the same time we tell them that scientists and technicians must be enlisted in the serviceof socialised farming, for small-scale farming will not bringdeliverance from want. 
 And we shall do what we are doing inthe Red Army—we may be beaten a hundred times, but thehundred-and-first we defeat all our enemies. 
 But to do this, work in the countryside must proceed by joint efforts, smoothly, in the same strict, orderly way as it hasproceeded in the Red Army and as it is proceeding in otherfields of economy. 
 We shall slowly and steadily prove tothe peasants the superiority of socialised farming. 
 This is the struggle we must wage on the state farms, this is where the difficulty of transition to socialism lies, and it is thus that Soviet power can be really and finallyconsolidated. 
 When the majority of the middle peasantscome to see that unless they ally themselves with the work-ers they are helping Kolchak and Yudenich, that in all theworld only the capitalists remain with them—the capital-ists who hate Soviet Russia and for years to come will repeat their attempts to restore their power—even the mostbackward middle peasants will realise that either they mustforge ahead in alliance with the revolutionary workerstoward complete emancipation or, if they vacillate evenslightly, the enemy, the old capitalist exploiter, will gain the upper hand. 
 Victory over Denikin is not enough to destroy the capitalists once and for all. 
 This is something we allmust realise. 
 We know full well that they will try time and again to throw the noose around Soviet Russia’s neck. 
 Hence the peasant has no choice; he must help the workers, for the slightest hesitation will bring victory to the landowners and capitalists. 
 Our primary, basic task is to help the peas-ants understand this. 
 The peasant who lives by his ownlabour is a loyal ally of Soviet power, and the worker regardssuch a peasant as his equal, the workers’ government doeseverything it can for him, indeed there is no sacrifice the workers’ and peasants’ government is not ready to make to satisfy the needs of such a peasant. 
 But the peasant who makes use of the surplus grain he possesses to exploit others is our enemy. 
 To satisfy thebasic needs of a hungry country is a duty to the state. 
Yet far from all peasants realise that freedom to trade in grain is a crime against the state. 
 “I have raised this grain, it is my product, and I have a right to do business with it,”the peasant reasons out of habit, as he used to. 
 But we saythis is a crime against the state . 
 Freedom to trade in grain means enriching oneself by means of this grain, i. 
e. 
, areturn to the old way of life, to capitalism, and this we shall not allow, this we shall fight against at all costs. 
 In the transition period we shall carry out state purchases of grain and requisition grain surpluses. 
 We know that onlyin this way shall we be able to do away with want and hunger. 
The vast majority of the workers suffer hardship becauseof the incorrect distribution of grain; to distribute it prop-erly, the peasants must deliver their quotas to the state as assessed, exactly, conscientiously, and without fail. 
 HereSoviet power can make no concessions. 
 This is not a matterof the workers’ government fighting the peasants, but anissue involving the very existence of socialism, the existenceof Soviet power. 
 Today we cannot give the peasants any goods, because there is a shortage of fuel and railway traf-fic is being held up. 
 We must start with the peasants lendingthe workers grain at fixed prices, not at profiteering prices,so that the workers can revive production. 
 Every peasantwill agree to this if it is a question of an individual workerdying from starvation before his eyes. 
 But when mil-lions of workers are in question, they do not understand this and the old habits of profiteering gain the upperhand. 
 Prolonged and persistent struggle against such habits, agitation and propaganda, explanatory work, checking up on what has been done—these are the components of our policy toward the peasantry. 
 We must render every support to the working peasant, treat him as an equal, without the slightest attempt toimpose anything on him by force—that is our first task. 
Our second task is to wage an unswerving struggle against profiteering, huckstering, ruination. 
 When we began to build the Red Army, we had only separate, scattered groups of guerrillas to start with. 
 Lackof discipline and unity resulted in many unnecessary sac-rifices, but we overcame these difficulties and built up aRed Army millions strong in place of the guerrilla detach-ments. 
 If we were able to do this in the brief period of two years, and in a sphere as difficult and hazardous as the army,we are all the more certain that we can achieve similarresults in all spheres of economic endeavour. 
 I am certain that although this problem of the proper attitude of the workers to the peasantry and of the correct food policy is one of the most difficult, we shall solve it and win a victory in this field such as we have won at thefront. 
 Pravda No. 
 259, Published according to November 19, 1919 the Pravda text ADDRESS TO THE SECON D ALL-RUSSI A CONGRESS OF COMMUNIS T ORGANISATION S OF THE PEOPLES OF THE EAS T51 NOVEMBER 22, 1919 Comrades, I am very glad of the opportunity to greet this Congress of Communist comrades representing Moslem organisations of the East, and to say a few words about the situation now obtaining in Russia and throughout the world. 
 The subject of my address is current affairs, and itseems to me that the most essential aspects of this questionat present are the attitude of the peoples of the East toimperialism, and the revolutionary movement among thosepeoples. 
 It is self-evident that this revolutionary move-ment of the peoples of the East can now develop effectively, can reach a successful issue, only in direct association withthe revolutionary struggle of our Soviet Republic againstinternational imperialism. 
 Owing to a number of circum-stances, among them the backwardness of Russia and her vastarea, and the fact that she constitutes a frontier between Europe and Asia, between the West and the East, we had to bear the whole brunt—and we regard that as a great honour—of being the pioneers of the world struggle against imperial-ism. 
 Consequently, the whole course of development in theimmediate future presages a still broader and more strenuousstruggle against international imperialism, and will inevi-tably be linked with the struggle of the Soviet Republic against the forces of united imperialism—of Germany,France, Britain and the U. 
S. 
A. 
 As regards the military aspect of the matter, you know how favourable our situation now is on all the fronts. 
 I shall not dwell in detail on this question; I shall only say that the Civil War which was forced upon us by interna-tional imperialism has in two years inflicted incalculable hard-ship upon the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Repub-lic, and imposed upon the peasants and workers a burdenso intolerable that it often seemed they would not be able to endure it. 
 But at the same time, because of its brute vio-lence, because of the ruthlessly brutal onslaught of our so-called allies, turned wild beasts, who robbed us even beforethe socialist revolution, this war has performed a miracleand turned people weary of fighting and seemingly incapableof bearing another war into warriors who have not only with-stood the war for two years but are bringing it to a victorious end. 
 The victories we are now gaining over Kolchak, Yude-nich and Denikin signify the advent of a new phase in thehistory of the struggle of world imperialism against the coun-tries and nations which have risen up to fight for their eman-cipation. 
 In this respect, the two years of our Civil War have fully confirmed what has long been known to history— that the character of a war and its success depend chieflyupon the internal regime of the country that goes to war,that war is a reflection of the internal policy conducted bythe given country before the war. 
 All this is inevitablyreflected in the prosecution of a war. 
 Which class waged the war, and is continuing to wage it, is a very important question. 
 Only due to our CivilWar being waged by workers and peasants who have emanci-pated themselves, and to its being a continuation of thepolitical struggle for the emancipation of the working peoplefrom the capitalists of their own country and of the whole world—only thanks to this were people to be found in such a backward country as Russia, worn out as she was by fouryears of imperialist war, who were strong-willed enoughto carry on that war during two years of incredible andunparalleled hardship and difficulty. 
 This was very strikingly illustrated in the history of the Civil War in the case of Kolchak. 
 Kolchak was an enemy who had the assistance of all the world’s strongest powers;he had a railway which was protected by some hundred thousand foreign troops, including the finest troops of the world imperialists, such as the Japanese, for example, who had been trained for the imperialist war, but took prac-tically no part in it and therefore suffered little; Kolchakhad the backing of the Siberian peasants, who were the mostprosperous and had never known serfdom, and therefore,naturally, were farthest of all from communism. 
 It seemedthat Kolchak was an invincible force, because his troops were the advance guard of international imperialism. 
 To this day, Japanese and Czechoslovak troops and the troopsof a number of other imperialist nations are operating inSiberia. 
 Nevertheless, the more than a year’s experience ofKolchak’s rule over Siberia and her vast natural resources,which was at first supported by the socialist parties of the Second International, by the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who set up the Constituent Assembly Com-mittee front, and which therefore, under these conditions,from the standpoint of the man in the street and of theordinary course of history, appeared to be firm and invincible—that experience actually revealed the following. 
 The farther Kolchak advanced into the heart of Russia, the more he wore himself out, and in the end we have witnessedSoviet Russia’s complete triumph over Kolchak. 
 Here weundoubtedly have practical proof that the united forces ofworkers and peasants who have been emancipated from thecapitalist yoke can perform real miracles. 
 Here we have practical proof that when a revolutionary war really does attract and interest the working and oppressed people,when it makes them conscious that they are fighting theexploiters—such a revolutionary war engenders the strengthand ability to perform miracles. 
 I think that what the Red Army has accomplished, its struggle, and the history of its victory, will be of colossal, epochal significance for all the peoples of the East. 
 It willshow them that, weak as they may be, and invincible asmay seem the power of the European oppressors, who in thestruggle employ all the marvels of technology and of themilitary art—nevertheless, a revolutionary war waged by oppressed peoples, if it really succeeds in arousing the mil-lions of working and exploited people, harbours such poten-tialities, such miracles, that the emancipation of the peoples of the East is now quite practicable, from the standpoint not only of the prospects of the international revolution, but also of the direct military experience acquired in Asia, in Sibe-ria, the experience of the Soviet Republic, which has sufferedthe armed invasion of all the powerful imperialist countries. 
 Furthermore, the experience of the Civil War in Russia has shown us and the Communists of all countries that, inthe crucible of civil war, the development of revolutionary enthusiasm is accompanied by a powerful inner cohesion. 
 War tests all the economic and organisational forces ofa nation. 
 In the final analysis, infinitely hard as the warhas been for the workers and peasants, who are sufferingfamine and cold, it may be said on the basis of these twoyears’ experience that we are winning and will continue to win, because we have a hinterland, and a strong one, because, despite famine and cold, the peasants and workersstand together, have grown strong, and answer every heavyblow with a greater cohesion of their forces and increasedeconomic might. 
 And it is this alone that has made possiblethe victories over Kolchak, Yudenich and their allies, the strongest powers in the world. 
 The past two years have shown, on the one hand, that a revolutionary war can bedeveloped, and, on the other, that the Soviet system is grow-ing stronger under the heavy blows of the foreign invasion,the aim of which is to destroy quickly the revolutionarycentre, the republic of workers and peasants who have dared to declare war on international imperialism. 
 But instead of destroying the workers and peasants of Russia, these heavyblows have served to harden them. 
 That is the chief lesson, the chief content of the pres-ent period. 
 We are on the eve of decisive victories overDenikin, the last enemy left on our soil. 
 We feel strong and may reiterate a thousand times over that we are not mis-taken when we say that internally the Republic has becomeconsolidated, and that we shall emerge from the war againstDenikin very much stronger and better prepared for the taskof erecting the socialist edifice—to which we have been ableto devote all too little time and energy during the Civil War, but to which, now that we are setting foot on a free road, we shall undoubtedly be able to devote ourselvesentirely. 
 In Western Europe we see the decay of imperialism. 
 You know that a year ago it seemed even to the German socialists, and to the vast majority of socialists—who did not understand the state of affairs—that what was inprogress was a struggle of two world imperialist groups,and they believed that this struggle constituted the wholeof history, that there was no force capable of producinganything else. 
 It seemed to them that even socialists had no alternative but to join sides with one of the groups of powerful world predators. 
 That is how it seemed at the closeof October 1918. 
 But we find that in the year that has sinceelapsed world history has witnessed unparalleled events,profound and far-reaching events, and these have openedthe eyes of many socialists who during the imperialist war were patriots and justified their conduct on the plea that they were faced with an enemy; they justified their alliancewith the British and French imperialists on the groundsthat these were supposedly bringing delivery from Germanimperialism. 
 See how many illusions were shattered by thatwar! We are witnessing the decay of German imperialism, a decay which has led not only to a republican, but even to a socialist revolution. 
 You know that in Germany today theclass struggle has become still more acute and that civilwar is drawing nearer and nearer—a war of the Germanproletariat against the German imperialists, who haveadopted republican colours, but who remain imperialists. 
 Everyone knows that the social revolution is maturing in Western Europe by leaps and bounds, and that the samething is happening in America and in Britain, the countriesostensibly representing culture and civilisation, victorsover the Huns, the German imperialists. 
 Yet when it cameto the Treaty of Versailles, everyone saw that it was a hun-dred times more rapacious than the Treaty of Brest which the German robbers forced upon us, and that it was theheaviest blow the capitalists and imperialists of thoseluckless victor countries could possibly have struck atthemselves. 
 The Treaty of Versailles opened the eyes ofthe people of the victor nations, and showed that in the case of Britain and France, even though they are democratic states, we have before us not representatives of cultureand civilisation, but countries ruled by imperialist predators. 
 The internal struggle among these predators is developing so swiftly that we may rejoice in the knowledge that the Treaty of Versailles is only a seeming victory for the jubilant imperialists, and that in reality it signifies the bankruptcyof the entire imperialist world and the resolute abandonmentby the working people of those socialists who during the warallied themselves with the representatives of decaying impe-rialism and defended one of the groups of belligerent preda-tors. 
 The eyes of the working people have been opened because the Treaty of Versailles was a rapacious peace and showed thatFrance and Britain had actually fought Germany in orderto strengthen their rule over the colonies and to enhancetheir imperialist might. 
 That internal struggle growsbroader as time goes on. 
 Today I saw a wireless message from London dated November 21, in which American jour-nalists—men who cannot be suspected of sympathising withrevolutionaries—say that in France an unprecedented out-burst of hatred towards the Americans is to be observed, be-cause the Americans refuse to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. 
 Britain and France are victors, but they are up to their ears in debt to America, who has decided that the French and the British may consider themselves victors as much asthey like, but that she is going to skim the cream and exactusurious interest for her assistance during the war; and theguarantee of this is to be the American Navy which is nowbeing built and is overtaking the British Navy in size. 
 And the crudeness of the Americans’ rapacious imperialism may be seen from the fact that American agents are buying whiteslaves, women and girls, and shipping them to America forthe development of prostitution. 
 Just think, free, culturedAmerica supplying white slaves for brothels! Conflicts withAmerican agents are occurring in Poland and Belgium. 
 That is a tiny illustration of what is taking place on a vast scale in every little country which received assistance from theEntente. 
 Take Poland, for instance. 
 You find Americanagents and profiteers going there and buying up all thewealth of Poland, who boasts that she is now an independentpower. 
 Poland is being bought up by American agents. 
 There is not a factory or branch of industry which is not in the pockets of the Americans. 
 The Americans have become sobrazen that they are beginning to enslave that “great and free victor”, France, who was formerly a country of usurers, but is now deep in debt to America, because she has lost her economic strength, and has not enough grain or coal of her own and cannot develop her material resources on a largescale, while America insists that the tribute be paid unre-servedly and in full. 
 It is thus becoming increasingly appar-ent that France, Britain and other powerful countries areeconomically bankrupt. 
 In the French elections the Cleri-cals have gained the upper hand. 
 The French people, who were deceived into devoting all their strength supposedly tothe defence of freedom and democracy against Germany, havenow been rewarded with an interminable debt, with thesneers of the rapacious American imperialists and, on topof it, with a Clerical majority consisting of representatives of the most savage reaction. 
 The situation all over the world has become immeasurably more complicated. 
 Our victory over Kolchak and Yudenich,those lackeys of international capital, is a big one; butfar bigger, though not so evident, is the victory we aregaining on an international scale. 
 That victory consists in the internal decay of imperialism, which is unable to send its troops against us. 
 The Entente tried it, but to nopurpose, because its troops become demoralised when theycontact our troops and acquaint themselves with our RussianSoviet Constitution, translated into their languages. 
 Despitethe influence of the leaders of putrid socialism, our Consti-tution will always win the sympathy of the working people. 
 The word “Soviet” is now understood by everybody, and theSoviet Constitution has been translated into all languagesand is known to every worker. 
 He knows that it is the con-stitution of working people, the political system of workingpeople who are calling for victory over international capital, that it is a triumph we have achieved over the international imperialists. 
 This victory of ours has had its repercussionsin all imperialist countries, since we have deprived them oftheir own troops, won them over, deprived them of thepossibility of using those troops against Soviet Russia. 
 They tried to wage war with the troops of other coun-tries—Finland, Poland, and Latvia—but nothing came of it. 
 British Minister Churchill, speaking in the House of Com-mons several weeks ago, boasted—and it was cabled all over the world—that a campaign of fourteen nations against Soviet Russia had been organised, and that this would result in victory over Russia by the New Year. 
 And it is true that many nations participated in it—Finland, the Ukraine,Poland, Georgia, as well as the Czechoslovaks, the Japanese,the French, the British, and the Germans. 
 But we know whatcame of it! We know that the Estonians left Yudenich’sforces in the lurch; and now a fierce controversy is going on in the press because the Estonians do not want to help him, while Finland, much as her bourgeoisie wanted it, hasnot assisted Yudenich either. 
 Thus the second attempt toattack us has likewise failed. 
 The first stage was the dispatchby the Entente of its own troops, equipped according to allthe rules of military technique, so that it seemed they would defeat the Soviet Republic. 
 They have already withdrawn from the Caucasus, Archangel and the Crimea; they stillremain in Murmansk, as the Czechoslovaks do in Siberia,but only as isolated groups. 
 The first attempt of the Ententeto defeat us with its own forces ended in victory for us. 
 Thesecond attempt consisted in launching against us nations which are our neighbours, and which are entirely dependent finan-cially on the Entente, and in trying to force them to crushus, as a nest of socialism. 
 But that attempt, too, ended infailure: it turned out that not one of these little countriesis capable of waging such a war. 
 What is more, hatred of theEntente has taken firm root in every little country. 
 If Finland did not set out to capture Petrograd when Yudenich had already captured Krasnoye Selo, it was because shehesitated, realising that she could live independently side byside with Soviet Russia, but could not live in peace with theEntente. 
 All little nations have felt that. 
 It is felt in Finland,Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland, where chauvinism is ramp-ant, but where there is hatred of the Entente, which is expanding its exploitation in those countries. 
 And now,accurately assessing the course of developments, we may saywithout exaggeration that not only the first, but also thesecond stage of the international war against the SovietRepublic has failed. 
 All that remains for us to do now is to defeat Denikin’s forces, and they are already half-defeated. 
 Such is the present Russian and international situation which I have summarised briefly in my address. 
 Permit me /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR in conclusion, to say something about the situation that is developing in respect of the nationalities of the East. 
 You are representatives of the communist organisations and Communist Parties of various Eastern peoples. 
 I must saythat the Russian Bolsheviks have succeeded in forcing abreach in the old imperialism, in undertaking the exceeding-ly difficult, but also exceedingly noble task of blazing newpaths of revolution, whereas you, the representatives of the working people of the East, have before you a task that is still greater and newer. 
 It is becoming quite clear thatthe socialist revolution which is impending for the wholeworld will not be merely the victory of the proletariat ofeach country over its own bourgeoisie. 
 That would be pos-sible if revolutions came easily and swiftly. 
 We know that the imperialists will not allow this, that all countries are armed against their domestic Bolshevism and thattheir one thought is how to defeat Bolshevism at home. 
That is why in every country a civil war is brewing in whichthe old socialist compromisers are enlisted on the side ofthe bourgeoisie. 
 Hence, the socialist revolution will not be solely, or chiefly, a struggle of the revolutionary pro-letarians in each country against their bourgeoisie—no,it will be a struggle of all the imperialist-oppressed coloniesand countries, of all dependent countries, against interna-tional imperialism. 
 Characterising the approach of theworld social revolution in the Party Programme we adopted last March, we said that the civil war of the working people against the imperialists and exploiters in all the advancedcountries is beginning to be combined with national warsagainst international imperialism. 
 That is confirmed bythe course of the revolution, and will be more and moreconfirmed as time goes on. 
 It will be the same in the East. 
 We know that in the East the masses will rise as inde-pendent participants, as builders of a new life, becausehundreds of millions of the people belong to dependent, under-privileged nations, which until now have been objects ofinternational imperialist policy, and have only existed asmaterial to fertilise capitalist culture and civilisation. 
 And when they talk of handing out mandates for colonies, we know very well that it means handing out mandates forspoliation and plunder—handing out to an insignificant section of the world’s population the right to exploit the majority of the population of the globe. 
 That majority, which up till then had been completely outside the orbit of historical progress, because it could not constitute anindependent revolutionary force, ceased, as we know, toplay such a passive role at the beginning of the twentiethcentury. 
 We know that 1905 was followed by revolutions inTurkey, Persia and China, and that a revolutionary move-ment developed in India. 
 The imperialist war likewise contributed to the growth of the revolutionary movement,because the European imperialists had to enlist whole colo-nial regiments in their struggle. 
 The imperialist war arousedthe East also and drew its peoples into international politics. 
Britain and France armed colonial peoples and helped them to familiarise themselves with military technique and up-to-date machines. 
 That knowledge they will use against theimperialist gentry. 
 The period of the awakening of the Eastin the contemporary revolution is being succeeded by a periodin which all the Eastern peoples will participate in decidingthe destiny of the whole world, so as not to be simply objects of the enrichment of others. 
 The peoples of the East are becoming alive to the need for practical action, the needfor every nation to take part in shaping the destiny of allmankind. 
 That is why I think that in the history of the develop-ment of the world revolution—which, judging by its begin-ning, will continue for many years and will demand much effort—that in the revolutionary struggle, in the revolu-tionary movement you will be called upon to play a bigpart and to merge with our struggle against internationalimperialism. 
 Your participation in the international rev-olution will confront you with a complicated and difficult task, the accomplishment of which will serve as the founda-tion for our common success, because here the majority ofthe people for the first time begin to act independentlyand will be an active factor in the fight to overthrowinternational imperialism. 
 Most of the Eastern peoples are in a worse position than the most backward country in Europe—Russia. 
 But in our struggle against feudal survivals and capitalism, wesucceeded in uniting the peasants and workers of Russia; and it was because the peasants and workers united against capitalism and feudalism that our victory was so easy. 
 Here contact with the peoples of the East is particularly important, because the majority of the Eastern peoples aretypical representatives of the working people—not workerswho have passed through the school of capitalist factories,but typical representatives of the working and exploitedpeasant masses who are victims of medieval oppression. 
 The Russian revolution showed how the proletarians, after defeating capitalism and uniting with the vast diffuse massof working peasants, rose up victoriously against medievaloppression. 
 Our Soviet Republic must now muster all theawakening peoples of the East and, together with them, wagea struggle against international imperialism. 
 In this respect you are confronted with a task which has not previously confronted the Communists of the world:relying upon the general theory and practice of communism,you must adapt yourselves to specific conditions such as donot exist in the European countries; you must be able toapply that theory and practice to conditions in which the bulk of the population are peasants, and in which the task is to wage a struggle against medieval survivals and notagainst capitalism. 
 That is a difficult and specific task,but a very thankful one, because masses that have taken nopart in the struggle up to now are being drawn into it, and alsobecause the organisation of communist cells in the East gives you an opportunity to maintain the closest contact with the Third International. 
 You must find specific formsfor this alliance of the foremost proletarians of the worldwith the labouring and exploited masses of the East whoseconditions are in many cases medieval. 
 We have accomplishedon a small scale in our country what you will do on a big scale and in big countries. 
 And that latter task you will, I hope, perform with success. 
 Thanks to the communistorganisations in the East, of which you here are the repre-sentatives, you have contact with the advanced revolution-ary proletariat. 
 Your task is to continue to ensure that com-munist propaganda is carried on in every country in a lan-guage the people understand. 
 It is self-evident that final victory can be won only by the proletariat of all the advanced countries of the world, and we, the Russians, are beginning the work which the British, French or German proletariat will consolidate. 
 But we see that they will not be victorious without the aid of the working people of all the oppressed colonial nations,first and foremost, of Eastern nations. 
 We must realisethat the transition to communism cannot be accomplishedby the vanguard alone. 
 The task is to arouse the workingmasses to revolutionary activity, to independent action and to organisation, regardless of the level they have reached; to translate the true communist doctrine, which was intendedfor the Communists of the more advanced countries, into thelanguage of every people; to carry out those practical taskswhich must be carried out immediately, and to join the pro-letarians of other countries in a common struggle. 
 Such are the problems whose solution you will not find in any communist book, but will find in the common strugglebegun by Russia. 
 You will have to tackle that problem andsolve it through your own independent experience. 
 In thatyou will be assisted, on the one hand, by close alliancewith the vanguard of the working people of other countries, and, on the other, by ability to find the right approach to the peoples of the East whom you here represent. 
 You willhave to base yourselves on the bourgeois nationalism whichis awakening, and must awaken, among those peoples, andwhich has its historical justification. 
 At the same time,you must find your way to the working and exploited masses of every country and tell them in a language they understand that their only hope of emancipation lies in the victoryof the international revolution, and that the internationalproletariat is the only ally of all the hundreds of millionsof the working and exploited peoples of the East. 
 Such is the immense task which confronts you, and which, thanks to the era of revolution and the growth of the revo-lutionary movement—of that there can be no doubt—will,by the joint efforts of the communist organisations of theEast, be successfully accomplished and crowned by completevictory over international imperialism.

 members on Ukrainian territory must put into practice the right of the working people to study in the Ukrainian language and tospeak their native language in all Soviet institutions; they must in every way counteract attempts at Russification that push the Ukrainian language into the background and must convert that language into an instrument for the communist education of the working people. 
 Steps must be taken imme-diately to ensure that in all Soviet institutions there aresufficient Ukrainian-speaking employees and that in futureall employees are able to speak Ukrainian. 
 (4) It is essential to ensure the closest contact between Soviet institutions and the native peasant population of the country, for which purpose it must be made the rule,even at the earliest stages, that when revolutionary commit-tees and Soviets are being established the labouring peasantsmust have a majority in them with the poor peasants exercis-ing a decisive influence. 
 (5) Since the population of the Ukraine is predominantly peasant to an even greater extent than that of Russia, itis the task of the Soviet government in the Ukraine to winthe confidence, not only of the poor peasants, but also ofthe broad sections of the middle peasantry whose real inter-ests link them very closely with Soviet power. 
 In particu-lar, while retaining the food policy in principle (the state procurement of grain at fixed prices) the methods of itsapplication must be changed. 
 The immediate purpose of the food policy in the Ukraine must be the requisitioning of grain surpluses to the strictlylimited extent necessary to supply the Ukrainian rural poor, the workers and the Red Army. 
 When requisitioning surpluses, special attention must be paid to the interests ofthe middle peasants, who must be carefully distinguishedfrom kulak elements. 
 It is essential to expose to the Ukrain-ian peasantry the counter-revolutionary demagogy that triesto impress on them that the purpose of Soviet Russia is to channel grain and other food products from the Ukraine into Russia. 
 It must be made incumbent on all agents of the central authorities, all Party officials, Party instructors, etc,to draw the poor and middle peasantry extensively into thework of government. 
 For the same purpose (the establishment of the real power of the working people) measures must be immediatelytaken to prevent Soviet institutions from being flooded with Ukrainian urban petty bourgeoisie, who have no conception of the living conditions of the peasant masses and who frequently masquerade as Communists. 
 A condition for the admission of such elements into the ranks of the Party and into Soviet institutions must bea preliminary practical verification of their competenceand their loyalty to the interests of the working people,primarily at the front, in the ranks of the army. 
 Everywhere and under all circumstances such elements must be placed under the strict class control of the proletariat. 
 We know from experience that due to the unorganised state of the poor the large number of weapons in the handsof the Ukrainian rural population is inevitably beingconcentrated in the hands of the kulaks and counter-revolutionaries which actually leads to the domination of kulak bandits instead of the dictatorship of the workingpeople; in view of this a primary task in organising SovietUkraine is to withdraw all weapons and concentrate themin the hands of the workers’ and peasants’ Red Army. 
 (6) In the same way, the land policy must be effected with special attention paid to the farming of the poor and middle peasantry. 
 The tasks of the land policy in the Ukraine are: (1) The complete abolition of the landed proprietorship re-established by Denikin and the transfer of the landedestates to peasants possessing little or no land. 
 (2) State farms to be organised in strictly limited numbers and of limited size and in each case in conformity with theinterests of the surrounding peasantry. 
 (3) In organising peasants in communes, artels, etc. 
, the Party policy must be strictly adhered to, which in thisrespect does not permit any coercion, leaving it to the peas-ants to decide freely for themselves and penalising all attempts to introduce the principle of coercion.

 Comrades, according to Party Rules this type of confer-ence should be convened every three months, but the diffi-cult situation obtaining a few months ago in connection with the war forced us to bend our efforts and to reduce all bodies, both government and Party, to such an extent that we wereunfortunately unable to carry out the Rules to the letterand the conference was postponed. 
 Comrades, we are calling this conference in connection with the Congress of Soviets 55 at a time when we have suc-ceeded in achieving a tremendous improvement on the fronts, and when we are certain that we are on the eve of a giganticchange for the better in the international situation, inrespect of the war and in respect of our internal develop-ment. 
 The tasks that are unfolding before us have beenfrequently discussed at Party meetings and in the press, and we shall return to them when discussing definite individual items on the agenda. 
 I shall, therefore, get right down tobusiness and propose that you elect a presidium for theconference. 
 Let me have your proposals on that point, please. 
 Izvestia No. 
 217, Published according to December 3, 1919 the verbatim report, verified with the Izvestia text 2 POLITICAL REPORT OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE DECEMBER 2 (Applause . 
) Comrades, the present report of the Central Committee should, from the formal point of view, give youmainly a summary of experience acquired during the periodunder review. 
 I must say that such an approach—confiningoneself to history or, at any rate, making a report thatturns mainly on history—is too far removed from the spirit of the times in which we live and from the tasks that con-front us. 
 In the present report, which I should also liketo present to the Congress of Soviets, I intend to transferthe centre of gravity more to the lessons we are receiving,and which we must receive for our immediate practicalactivity, rather than to a description of what we have passed through. 
 Although we may say, without any exaggeration, that in the period under review we have achieved tremendous suc-cesses, although our main difficulty is now behind us, westill have ahead of us difficulties that are without doubt very,very great. 
 The Party must naturally concentrate its atten-tion wholly on the solution of those problems and may permit itself excursions into history only insofar as it is abso-lutely necessary for the solution of the problems facing us. 
 It stands to reason that in the past period of Soviet power the war question has persistently been the one on whichwe have mostly fixed our attention. 
 The Civil War has involved everyone and everything, of course, and it goes without saying that in our struggle for existence we had todivert the Party’s best forces from other work and other activities and use them for war work. 
 It was all we could do under war conditions. 
 And no matter how much we have suffered from this withdrawal of creative forces from many spheres of government and Party activity, in themilitary sphere we have actually managed to effect a concen-tration of forces and achieve excellent results such as notonly our enemies, not only the waverers, but probably evenmost of our own milieu would formerly have considered impossible. 
 To hold out for two years against all our enemies who were supported directly and indirectly, first byGerman imperialism and then by the much more powerfulEntente imperialism that has mastered the whole world—tohold out for two years in a country so badly ruined and sobackward was such a problem that its solution was an undoubted “miracle”. 
 It seems to me, therefore, that we must look closely to see how this “miracle” was effected and whatpractical deductions are to be made from it, deductions whichwill enable us to say conclusively—and I think we may sayconclusively—that great as the difficulties of internalorganisation are we shall surmount them in the near future with a success equal to that with which we have solved the problems of military defence. 
 World imperialism, that in reality brought about the Civil War in our country and is responsible for protractingit, has suffered defeat in these two years, and we mustfirst of all ask ourselves the question, how could it have happened that we were able to achieve such tremendous suc-cess in the struggle against world imperialism that eventoday is undoubtedly many times stronger than we are?To find an answer to this question we must make a generalreview of the history of the Civil War in Russia, the historyof Entente intervention. 
 In this war we must distinguish two periods that differ radically according to the methods of Entente activity employed, two periods or two basicmethods of conducting military operations against Russia. 
 When the Entente had defeated Germany, at first it naturally relied on its own troops to crush the SovietRepublic in Russia. 
 It stands to reason that if the Entente had used but a fraction of the gigantic armies that were released after the defeat of Germany, if it had been able touse even one-tenth of those armies in a proper manner against the Russian Soviet Republic we should not, of course, have been able to hold out. 
 It is typical of the first period of the Civil War in Russia that the attempt of the Entente to smash the Soviet Republic using its own troops was afailure. 
 The Entente had to withdraw the British troopsoperating on the Archangel Front. 
 The landing of Frenchforces in the South of Russia ended in a number of mutinieson the part of French sailors, and today, no matter how fran-tically the war-time censor may operate—there is no war but the former war-time censor, now the non-war-time cen-sor, continues to function in the supposedly free countries,Britain and France—and although copies of newspapers reachus on rare occasions we have very precise documentary evi-dence from Britain and France to the effect that information concerning, for instance, the mutiny of the sailors on French warships in the Black Sea has got into the French press,that the sentencing of several French sailors to penal servitudehas become known in France, that the entire communist,the entire revolutionary working-class press in France andBritain refers to the facts; the name of Comrade Jeanne Labourbe, whom the French shot in Odessa for Bolshevik propaganda, has become a slogan for the French working-class socialist press, not only for the Communist wing, buteven for a newspaper like l’Humanité 56 that in its basic principles is actually closer to the point of view of our Men-sheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, even for that newspa-per the name of Labourbe has become a slogan of struggle against French imperialism, for non-intervention in Rus-sian affairs. 
 In the same way letters from British soldierson the Archangel Front have been discussed in the Britishworking-class press. 
 We have very exact documentary evi-dence of this. 
 It is quite obvious to us, therefore, that the tremendous change that formerly we always spoke of and which we so deeply hoped for has taken place; it hasundoubtedly become a fact even though the process is anunusually slow one. 
 This change had to be evoked by the very course of events. 
 It is specifically those countries that always have been and still are regarded as the most democratic, civilised and cul-tured that conducted a war against Russia by the most bru-tal means, without even a shade of legality. 
 The Bolsheviks are accused of violating democracy—this is the most popular argument against us among the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries and in the entire European bourgeois press. 
 But not one of those democratic states has taken orwould dare to take the risk under the laws of its own countryof declaring war on Soviet Russia. 
 Parallel to this there isa protest, outwardly unnoticeable but nevertheless a pro-found protest on the part of the working-class press which asks where, in their constitution, in the constitution of France, Britain or America, are to be found laws permit-ting the conduct of war without having declared war andwithout having consulted parliament? The press of Britain,France and America has proposed to arraign their heads ofstate for a crime against the state, for declaring war with-out the permission of parliament. 
 Such proposals have been made, although it is true that it was in papers thatcome out not more than once a week and are probably confis-cated not less than once a month and have a circulation ofa few hundred or a few thousand copies. 
 The leaders of theresponsible government parties could afford to ignore such papers. 
 But here we have to consider two different tenden-cies; the ruling classes throughout the world publish well-known capitalist dailies in millions of copies and theseare packed with unprecedented lies and slander against theBolsheviks. 
 But down below, the working-class masses learnabout the falsity of that whole campaign from the soldiers who have returned from Russia. 
 That is why it became neces-sary for the Entente to withdraw its forces from Russia. 
 When we said at the very outset that we place our stakes on the world revolution we were laughed at, and hundredsof times it was said and is still being said that it cannotbe realised. 
 During the past two years we have obtained precise material with which to verify it. 
 If we speak of that stake as meaning hopes for a rapid, immediate insurrec-tion in Europe, then we know there has not been one. 
 Thatstake, however, proved to be fundamentally a true one andfrom the very outset it removed all possibility of an armedintervention on the part of the Entente; after two years and especially since the defeat of Kolchak and since the withdrawal of British forces from Archangel and from the en-tire Northern Front this has become an undoubted historical fact. 
 A very small part of the armies at the disposal of the Entente would have been enough to crush us. 
 But we were able to defeat the enemy because the sympathy of the workers of the whole world made itself felt at the mostdifficult moment. 
 And thus we succeeded in emerging honour-ably from this first period of the Entente invasion. 
 I remem-ber some article, Radek’s I think, said that the Ententetroops’ contact with the hot soil of Russia, the country that had started the fire of the socialist revolution, would also set those troops on fire. 
 Events showed that this reallydid happen. 
 It goes without saying, furthermore, that theprocesses that are taking place among the British and Frenchsoldiers and sailors who know the names of those who havebeen shot for Bolshevik agitation, no matter how weak these processes are, no matter how weak the communist organisa-tions are over there, are doing a gigantic job. 
 The results arevisible—they have compelled the Entente countries to with-draw their forces. 
 This alone gave us our first major victory. 
 The second method or second system employed by the Ente-nte in its struggle was to use small states against us. 
 It was reported in a Swedish newspaper 57 at the end of last August that the British Secretary for War, Churchill, had said thatfourteen states would attack Russia so that the fall ofPetrograd and Moscow was certain in the near future, at anyrate by the end of the year. 
 I believe Churchill later deniedhaving made this statement and said that the Bolsheviks had invented it. 
 We have, however, exact information as to which Swedish newspaper published it. 
 We therefore insistthat the report came from European sources. 
 Furthermore itis supported by facts. 
 We know from the example of Finlandand Estonia that the Entente has bent all its efforts toforce them to attack Soviet Russia. 
 I personally read one leading article in the British newspaper The Times on the question of Finland 58 at the time when Yudenich’s troops were a few versts from Petrograd and the city was in tremen-dous danger. 
 The article was seething with wrath and indig-nation, and was written in an unprecedentedly impassionedstyle, unusual for that newspaper (such newspapers usually write in diplomatic language similar to that used in Milyu-kov’s Rech 59 in Russia). 
 It was the wildest proclamation addressed to Finland and presenting the question bluntly—the fate of the world depended on Finland and the eyes of all civilised capitalist countries were fixed on her. 
 We know that that was the decisive moment when Yudenich’s troops were a few versts from Petrograd. 
 It makes no difference whetherChurchill made the statement quoted or not, he certainlypursued that policy. 
 It is well known what pressure theEntente brought to bear on those small countries that hadbeen hastily formed, were weak and wholly dependent on the Entente even in such basic questions as that of food and in all other respects. 
 They cannot break away from thatdependence. 
 All kinds of pressure—financial, food, mili-tary—have been applied to force Estonia, Finland, and nodoubt Latvia, Lithuania and Poland as well, to force thatwhole group of states to make war on us. 
 The history of Yudenich’s last campaign against Petrograd has shown to the full that the Entente’s second method of conducting warhas failed. 
 There can be no doubt that the least bit of aidfrom Finland or—a little more aid—from Estonia wouldhave been enough to decide the fate of Petrograd. 
 Nor isthere any doubt that the Entente, realising the gravity of the situation, did everything it could to obtain that aid but nevertheless suffered defeat. 
 This was the second major international victory that we achieved and it was a more complicated victory than thefirst. 
 The first was achieved because it turned out thatBritish and French troops could not be retained on the ter-ritory of Russia; they did not fight but provided Britain and France with rebels who raised the British and French work-ers against their own governments. 
 And so it has happenedthat although Russia has been deliberately encircled by aring of small states obviously created and maintained for thestruggle against Bolshevism, this weapon, too, has turned against the Entente. 
 There are bourgeois governments in all these states and almost everywhere there are bourgeoiscollaborators in those governments, people who, because oftheir class position, go against the Bolsheviks. 
 Every oneof these nations, of course, is definitely hostile to the Bol-sheviks, but we, nevertheless, have managed to turn those bourgeois and collaborators to our side. 
 This seems improb-able, but it is true, because each of those states, afterwhat it has experienced in the imperialist war, is bound to hesitate on the question of whether it is now worth its while to fight against the Bolsheviks when the only other claimant to power in Russia—a claimant that they have rea-son to consider serious—is either Kolchak or Denikin, thatis, representatives of old imperialist Russia; and there isno doubt that Kolchak and Denikin represent old Russia. 
We have, therefore, been given an opportunity to rely onanother crack in the imperialist camp. 
 During the first months following our revolution we were able to hold out because the German and British imperialists were at eachother’s throats, but after those six months we were ableto hold out for more than another six months because thetroops of the Entente were in no condition to fight againstus; the following year, however, the year that we now have mainly to render account for, we held out successfully be-cause the attempt of the Great Powers under whose influencethe small countries undoubtedly are, the attempt of thoseGreat Powers to mobilise the small countries against us hasbeen a failure because of the contradiction between theinterests of world imperialism and the interests of those countries. 
 The Entente has already had its paws on each of the small countries. 
 They know that when the French,American or British capitalists say, “We guarantee you in-dependence”, that means in practice, “We shall buy from youall the sources of your wealth and shall hold you in bondage. 
Furthermore, we shall treat you with the insolence of an officer who has come to a foreign country to administer it and to speculate in it and who will not consider anybody’sopinion”. 
 They know that the British Ambassador in almostall such countries is of greater significance than a localking or parliament. 
 And if petty-bourgeois democrats haveso far been unable to comprehend this verity, reality has now compelled them to understand it. 
 It has turned out that as far as concerns the bourgeois and petty-bourgeoiselements of the small countries the imperialists are plunder-ing, we are, maybe, not allies, but at any rate more reliableand more valuable neighbours than the imperialists. 
 That is the second victory over world imperialism that we have won. 
 That is why we now have every right to say that the main difficulties are behind us. 
 There is no doubt that the Entente will make many more attempts at armed inter-vention in our affairs. 
 Although the latest victories over Kolchak and Yudenich have now given spokesmen of all those powers cause to say that a campaign against Russiais hopeless and to offer us peace, we must realise clearly themeaning of such statements. 
 What I am now going to sayis not for the record.... 
 Since we have managed to extract admissions of this kind from bourgeois intellectuals, from our merciless ene-mies, we have every right to say that the sympathies, notonly of the working class, but also of extensive circles ofbourgeois intellectuals are on the side of Soviet power. 
The philistines, the petty bourgeoisie, those who waveredin the savage fight between labour and capital, have now come over definitely to our side, and we may to some extent anticipate their support. 
 We must take this victory into consideration and if we link it up with the way we, in the long run, achieved thevictory over Kolchak, the conclusion becomes more convinc-ing ... now you may begin writing again, the diplomacy is finished. 
 If we ask the question as to what forces made our vic-tory over Kolchak possible, we have to admit that the victoryover Kolchak, despite his having operated on territory wherethe proletariat was in a minority and we were unable togive the peasantry direct, real help to overthrow the power of the landowners as we did in Russia, despite Kolchak’s having begun on a front supported by Mensheviks and Social-ist-Revolutionaries who established the front of the Constit-uent Assembly, despite there having been the most favour-able conditions for the formation of a government that couldrely on the aid of world imperialism—despite all this the experiment ended in the complete defeat of Kolchak. 
 We have the right to draw the following conclusion from this,a conclusion that is very significant to us and should guide usin all our activities— the class that can lead the mass of the population must triumph historically . 
 The Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries are still talking about the Con-stituent Assembly, about the will of the nation, and so on, but during this period experience has convinced us that inrevolutionary times the class struggle is carried on in the most terrible forms but can lead to victory only when the class conducting the struggle is capable of giving leader-ship to the majority of the people. 
 In this respect, the comparison that was made, not by voting with tickets, but bymore than a year’s experience of the most arduous, mostbloody struggle that demanded a hundred times more sacri-fices than any political struggle—this experience in respectof Kolchak has shown that more than any other party we are putting into effect the rule of that class the majority of which we have proved capable of leading and that we are addingthe peasantry to our ranks as friends and allies. 
 The exampleof Kolchak demonstrated this. 
 In the social sphere this exam-ple has been the latest lesson for us; it shows on whom we candepend and who will go against us. 
 No matter how greatly the working class may have been weakened by the imperialist war and the economic ruin itis nevertheless effecting political leadership, but it wouldnot be able to if it had not gained the majority of the work-ing population, under Russian conditions the peasantry, asfriends and allies. 
 This has taken place in the Red Army where we have been able to employ specialists, the majority of whom were against us, and create the army which, accordingto the admission of our enemies, the Socialist-Revolution-aries, as evidenced by a resolution of the last Council oftheir party, is a people’s and not a mercenary army. 
 60 The working class was able to build up an army the majority of which does not belong to that class and was able to employ specialists hostile to it only because it led andmade friends and allies of that mass of working peopleconnected with petty proprietorship, who have property con-nections and who, therefore, have a profound interest infree trading, i. 
e. 
, in capitalism, in the return to the power of money. 
 This is at the bottom of everything we have achieved in the past two years. 
 In all our further work, inall our further activities, in those activities that must bebegun in the Ukraine now being liberated, in allthe organisational work that will be developing in all itsdifficulty and importance after the victory over Denikin, we must keep this basic lesson always before our eyes, we must remember it more than anything else. 
 This, in myopinion, sums up the political results of all our work. 
 Comrades, it has been said that war is a continuation of politics. 
 We have experienced that in our own war. 
 The imperialist war that was a continuation of the politics of the imperialists, of the ruling classes, of landowners andcapitalists, brought forth the hostility of the masses ofthe people and was the best means of revolutionising them. 
Here in Russia the war helped overthrow the monarchy,helped abolish landed proprietorship and overthrow the bour-geoisie, all of which was done with unparalleled ease only because the imperialist war was a continuation and anaggravation of imperialist politics that had become moreinsolent. 
 And our war was a continuation of our communistpolitics, the politics of the proletariat. 
 We still read in theMenshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary papers and we hear from non-party and from wavering people, “You promised peace and have given us war, you have deceived the workingpeople. 
” And we say that the masses of the working people whohave not studied Marxism have nevertheless learned full wellthe difference between imperialist and civil war, learned itthrough their class instinct, the instinct of oppressed people who have themselves for decades experienced what the landowner and capitalist are. 
 Those who have experiencedoppression for decades all realise that there is a differencebetween wars. 
 The imperialist war was a continuation of impe-rialist politics; it aroused the masses against their masters. 
The Civil War is a war against the landowners and capital-ists and is a continuation of the policy of overthrowing the power of those landowners and capitalists, and each monththe development of the war has strengthened the bondsbetween the mass of working people and the proletariat thathas assumed the leadership in the war. 
 No matter how greatthe trials may have been, no matter how frequent the big defeats, no matter how serious those defeats have been, no matter how many times the enemy has achieved tremendousvictories and the existence of Soviet power has hung by athread—there have been such moments, and there is no doubtthe Entente will again try to fight against us—it must besaid that the experience we have gained is a very sound one. 
 That experience has shown that war strengthens the politi-cal consciousness of the working people and shows them theadvantages of Soviet power. 
 Naïve people or those who are wholly wrapped up in the prejudices of the old petty bour-geoisie or of the old bourgeois-democratic parliamentarism expect the peasant to decide through an election slip whether he will follow the Bolshevik Communists or theSocialist-Revolutionaries; they do not want to recognise anyother decision because they are in favour of rights for thepeople, freedom, the Constituent Assembly, etc. 
 Events madeit necessary for the peasant to verify the issue in practice. 
 After having given the Socialist-Revolutionaries the major-ity in the Constituent Assembly, after the policy of theSocialist-Revolutionaries had failed and the peasants had todeal with the Bolsheviks in practice, they realised that ourgovernment is a sound one, it is a government that demandsrather a lot, it is a government that is able to ensure the fulfilment of those demands at all costs, it is a government that regards the loan of bread to the hungry to be the absoluteduty of the peasants even if they receive no equivalent inreturn, they realised that ours is a government that willensure the supply of bread to the hungry no matter at whatcost The peasant saw this and compared our government with that of Kolchak and Denikin, and he made his choice, not through the ballot-box but by deciding the issue in prac-tice, when he had had the experience of both kinds ofgovernment. 
 The peasant is deciding and will continue todecide the question in our favour. 
 That is what the history of Kolchak’s defeat has taught us and that is what our victories in the South have proved. 
 That is why we say that literally masses, millions of peopleliving in the villages, millions of peasants are coming overcompletely to our side I think this is the chief politicallesson that we have learned in this period and which we mustapply to the problems of internal organisation that will, with the victory over Denikin near, be placed on the order of the day now that it has become possible for us to concen-trate on internal development. 
 The chief accusation made against us by the European petty bourgeoisie concerns our terrorism, our crude suppres-sion of the intelligentsia and the petty bourgeoisie. 
 “You and your governments have forced all that upon us,” we say in reply. 
 When people shout about terror we answer,“When countries who have the world’s fleets at their disposal and have armed forces that are a hundred times greater than ours pounced upon us and compelled small states to make war on us—was that not terrorism?” That was real terrorism when all the powers united against a country that was one of the most backward and mostweakened by war. 
 Even Germany kept helping the Ententefrom the time before her defeat when she was supplyingKrasnov and up to the present day, when that same Germany is blockading us and giving direct help to our enemies. 
 This attack by world imperialism, this campaign against us, thisbribery of conspirators inside the country—was this not ter-rorism? The reason for our terrorism was that we wereattacked by armed forces against which we had to bend all ourefforts. 
 Inside the country we had to act with all persistence, we had to muster all our forces. 
 In this case we did not want to be—and we decided that we would not be—in the posi-tion in which those who collaborated with Kolchak inSiberia found themselves, the position in which the Germancollaborationists will find themselves tomorrow, those whoimagine they represent a government and are relying on the Constituent Assembly although at any moment a hundred or a thousand officers can push that government out of office. 
This can be understood because those officers constitute atrained, organised mass with an excellent knowledge of theart of war, that holds all the strings in its hands, that iswell-informed about the bourgeoisie and the landowners and enjoys their sympathies. 
 This has been demonstrated by the history of all countries since the imperialist war, and today, when faced withsuch terrorism on the part of the Entente, we have the rightto resort to terror ourselves. 
 It follows from this that the accusation of terror, inso-far as it is justified, should be against the bourgeoisie and not against us. 
 They forced terror upon us. 
 And we shall bethe first to take steps to confine it to the lowest possibleminimum as soon as we put an end to the chief source of ter-rorism—the invasion of world imperialism, the war plotsand the military pressure of world imperialism on our country. 
 While speaking of terrorism we must say something about our attitude to that middle stratum, the intelligentsia, that mostly complain about the brutality of Soviet power and that Soviet power puts them in a worse position than before. 
 Whatever we, with the meagre means at our disposal, can do for the intelligentsia we are doing. 
 We know, ofcourse, the little significance of the paper ruble, but wealso know the significance of the black market as an aidto those who cannot get enough food through our food organ-isations. 
 In this respect we give the bourgeois intelligentsia an advantage. 
 We know that at the moment when world imperialism pounced on us we had to introduce strict mili-tary discipline and defend ourselves with all the forces wecould muster. 
 When we are pursuing a revolutionary war wecannot, of course, do what all bourgeois states do—leave theworking people to hear the brunt of the war. 
 The burden of the Civil War must be and will be shared by the entire intel-ligentsia, all the petty bourgeoisie, and all middle-classelements—all of them will bear the burden. 
 It will naturallybe more difficult for them to bear that burden becausethey have been privileged for decades, but in the interestsof the social revolution we must place that burden on their shoulders, too. 
 This is the way we reason and the way we act, and we cannot do otherwise. 
 The end of the Civil War will be a step towards improv-ing the conditions of those groups. 
 We have already shown byour tariff policy and by the declaration in our programmethat we recognise the need to give these groups better condi-tions because the transition from capitalism to communism is impossible unless the bourgeois specialists are used; andall our victories—all the victories of the Red Army led bythe proletariat that has drawn over to its side the peasantrywho are half labourers and half property-owners—wereachieved partly because of our ability to use bourgeois specialists. 
 This policy of ours as expressed in matters mili-tary must become the policy of our internal development. 
 The experience gained in this period tells us that while laying the foundations of the building we have often under-taken work on the dome, on all sorts of ornament, etc. 
Perhaps this was, to a certain extent, necessary for a social-ist republic. 
 Perhaps we had to build up in all spheres of national life. 
 The craving to build up in all spheres is per-fectly natural. 
 If we were to look at what has been done in the sphere of state organisation we would see almost everywhere many things begun and abandoned; these are the sort that make one want to say when looking at them that they could have waited and we should have begun with the mainthing. 
 It is quite natural that all our leading people shouldbe interested in the tasks that can be carried out only afterthe foundations have been laid. 
 But on the basis of thisexperience we can now say that in future we shall concen-trate our efforts more on the main job, on the foundation, on those simple problems that are the most difficult to solvebut which we shall nevertheless solve. 
 These are the problemof bread, the problem of fuel and the problem of fightingthe lice. 
 These are three simple problems that will makepossible the building of a socialist republic and then our victory throughout the world will be a hundred times more certain and more triumphant than that with whichwe repulsed the attack of the Entente. 
 The bread problem. 
 We have achieved much with our requisitioning system. 
 Our food policy has made it possiblein the second year to acquire three times as much grain as in the first. 
 During three months of the last campaign more grain was procured than during three months of lastyear, although, as you will hear in the report by the People’sCommissar for Food, it was accompanied by what were,without doubt, great difficulties. 
 One raid by Mamontov thattook in the whole southern part of the central agricultural zone cost us very dear. 
 But we have learned to carry out the requisitioning system, i. 
e. 
, we have learned to make thepeasants sell their grain to the state at fixed prices, with-out an equivalent in exchange. 
 We know full well, of course,that paper money is not the equivalent of grain. 
 We knowthat the peasant is loaning us his grain, and we ask him, “Should you hold back your grain waiting for an equivalent so that the workers can die of starvation? Do you want totrade on a free market and take us thereby back to capitalism?”Many intellectuals who have read Marx do not understandthat freedom to trade is a return to capitalism; the peasant,however, understands it more easily. 
 He knows that to sell bread at free prices, when the starving are prepared to pay anything for it, are prepared to give up all they have to escapedeath from starvation—he knows that this is a return to exploitation, that it is freedom for the rich to make a profit and ruination for the poor. 
 We say that this is a crime against the state and we shall not yield an inch in this struggle. 
 In this struggle to requisition grain the peasant will have to loan his grain to the hungry worker—that is theonly way to begin proper organisation, to restore industry,etc. 
 If the peasant does not do this, there will be a returnto capitalism. 
 If the peasant feels that he has ties with the workers he will be prepared to surrender his grain sur-pluses at fixed prices, i. 
e. 
, for a simple piece of colouredpaper—this is something essential without which the starv-ing worker cannot be saved from death, without whichindustry cannot be rehabilitated. 
 It is an extremely difficultproblem and it cannot be solved by force alone. 
 No matter how much shouting there may be about the Bolsheviks being a party that coerces the peasantry, we still say, “Gentle-men, it is a lie!” If we were a party that coerces the peas-antry, how could we have held out against Kolchak, howcould we have formed a conscript army in which four-fifthsof the soldiers are peasants, all of whom are armed and who have the example of the imperialist war to show them that a rifle can easily be turned in any direction? How can webe a party that coerces the peasants—we, a party thatis putting into effect the alliance between the working classand the peasantry, a party that tells the peasantry thatthe transition to free trading is a return to capitalism and that our requisitioning of surpluses by force is directed against the profiteer and not against the working people? The requisitioning of grain must be the basis of all our activity. 
 The food problem is at the basis of all problems. 
We have to devote a great deal of effort to defeat Denikin. 
There must not be the slightest hesitation or carelessness until the victory is complete, for all sorts of turns are possi-ble. 
 Whenever there is the slightest improvement in the warsituation, however, we must devote greater effort to thework of food supplies because that is the basis of everything. 
The requisitioning must be carried out in full. 
 Only whenwe have solved that problem shall we have a socialist foun-dation, and on that socialist foundation we shall be able to erect the splendid edifice of socialism that we have so oftenbegun to build from the top and which has so often collapsed. 
 Another basic problem is that of fuel, the main founda-tion for our development. 
 This is the problem we have come up against now, since we cannot take advantage of our suc-cesses in food supplies, since we cannot transport the grain,cannot make full use of our victories because there is nofuel. 
 We still do not have a proper apparatus to settle thefuel problem, but it is possible to settle it. 
 There is a shortage of coal throughout Europe today. 
 If the fuel problem is so acute in the richest of the victor countries, even those like America that has never beenattacked or invaded, it naturally affects us too. 
 It willtake us several years to rehabilitate the coal industry, evenunder the best conditions. 
 We have to save ourselves with firewood. 
 We are devot-ing more and more Party forces to this work. 
 During the last week the greatest attention has been paid to this prob-lem in the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council ofDefence and a number of measures have been adopted thatshould effect a turning-point in this sphere similar to thateffected by our armies on the Southern Front. 
 Our activities in this field must not slacken and every step must bring us closer to victory in the battle against the fuel hunger. 
The material supplies are available. 
 Until we have restoredthe coal industry we can manage with firewood and keep in-dustry supplied with fuel. 
 We must devote all Party forces,comrades, to that basic problem. 
 Our third problem is that of the fight against lice, against the lice that carry typhus. 
 Typhus among a population thatis exhausted by hunger, is ill, has no bread, soap or fuel,may prove a calamity that will prevent our tackling anysort of socialist development. 
 This is the first step in our struggle for culture and this, too, is a struggle for existence. 
 These are the main problems. 
 To these I should like to draw the attention, more than to anything else, of comradeswho are members of the Party. 
 So far the attention we havebeen paying to these problems is so little as to be out ofall proportion. 
 Nine-tenths of the forces that are not engaged in war activities—which must not be lessened for a single minute—must be directed to these priority tasks. 
We now have a clear picture of the issues at stake. 
 Everyone must make the best possible effort; all our forces must be devoted to these tasks. 
 With this I shall end the political section of the report. 
 As far as the international part is concerned, Comrade Chi-cherin will report on that in detail and will read you the pro-posal we should like to make to the belligerent countriesin the name of the Congress of Soviets. 
 I shall deal very briefly with Party tasks. 
 In the course of the revolution our Party has been confronted with a most important task. 
 It is natural, on the one hand, that all theworst elements should cling to the ruling party merely be-cause it is the ruling party. 
 On the other hand, the workingclass is exhausted and is naturally weak in a country thatis in ruins. 
 Nevertheless it is only the advanced section of the working class, its vanguard, that is capable of leading the country. 
 To accomplish this task in the sphereof state organisation we have employed subbotniks as oneof the means. 
 The slogan we have put forward is this—thefirst who can join our Party are those who have volunteeredfor the front; those who cannot fight must show in their own places that they understand what the workers’ party is, they must show it by applying the principles of communismin practice. 
 And communism, if you take that word in itsstrict meaning, is voluntary unpaid work for the commongood that does not depend on individual differences, that wipesout all memories of everyday prejudices, wipes out stagnation, tradition, differences between branches of work, differences in the rate of pay for labour, etc. 
 This is one of the greatestguarantees that we are drawing the working class and allworking people into the work of peace-time organisation aswell as into war-time activities. 
 The further development ofcommunist subbotniks must be a school. 
 Every step must be accompanied by the attraction into the Party of working-class elements and the most reliable people from other classes. 
We achieve this by means of re-registration. 
 We are notafraid to remove those who are not fully reliable. 
 We alsoachieve this by trusting a Party member who comes to us ina difficult time. 
 Those Party members, as today’s Central Committee report shows, who came to us in hundreds and thousands when Yudenich was a few versts from Petrogradand Denikin was north of Orel, when the bourgeoisie were already jubilant—those Party members are worthy of our trust. 
 We value the extension of the Party on these lines. 
 After we have carried out the expansion of the Party on these lines we must shut the gates, we must be particularlycautious. 
 We must say that now the Party is victorious wedo not need new Party members. 
 We know full well that in adisintegrating capitalist society a mass of harmful peoplewill try to worm their way into the Party. 
 We must create a party that will be a party of workers in which there is no place for alien elements, but we must also draw the massesinto the work, those who are outside the Party. 
 How is thisto be done? The means to this end—workers’ and peasants’non-party conferences. 
 An article on non-party conferences 61 was recently published in Pravda . 
 This article, written by Comrade Rostopchin, deserves special attention. 
 I do not know any other way of solving this problem of profound his-torical importance. 
 The Party cannot throw its doors wideopen, because it is absolutely inevitable that in the epochof disintegrating capitalism it will gather to itself theworst elements. 
 The Party must be so narrow that it draws into its ranks only those elements from other classes that it has an opportunity to test with great caution. 
 But we have several hundred thousand Party members in a country with a population of more than a hundred million. 
How can such a party govern? In the first place there are,and must be, the trade unions to assist it, and these have millions of members; the second assistant is non-party con-ferences. 
 At these non-party conferences we must be ableto approach the non-proletarian section, we must overcomeprejudice and petty-bourgeois vacillation—that is one ofour most important, fundamental tasks. 
 We must assess the success of our Party organisations, not only by the number of Party members engaged in some kind of work, not only by the degree of success in carrying outthe re-registration, but by non-party workers’ and peasants’conferences, whether they are arranged correctly and oftenenough, that is, by the ability of the organisation toapproach those masses that cannot at the moment join the Party but which we must draw into the work. 
 If we have beaten the Entente it is probably because we have earned the sympathy of the working class, and of the non-party masses. 
 If we have succeeded in defeating Kolchak it is probably because he was no longer able to draw more forces from the reservoir of the working people. 
 We have a reservoir that no other government in the world hasand which no government in the world except the governmentof the working class can have, because only the governmentof the working class can draw with absolute confidence onthe most downtrodden and most backward working people. 
 We can and must draw our forces from among the non-party workers and peasants because they are our true friends. 
 Forthe solution of the bread and fuel problems and for the fightagainst typhus we can draw forces from these masses thatwere the most oppressed by the capitalists and landowners. 
And we are assured of the support of those masses. 
 We shall continue to draw more and more forces from these masses and we may say that in the end we shall defeat all our enemies. 
And we shall work miracles in the sphere of peaceful con-struction (to be developed in proper style after Denikin hasbeen defeated) that will be greater than those we have workedin the military sphere in the past two years.

 There is no doubt that we should listen towhat experienced local functionaries have to say. 
 All theiradvice is valuable to us. 
 But I ask you, what is there bad in what is written here? I was not acquainted with that point. 
 Sapronov gave it to me. 
 It says here, “Draft Instruc-tions to Gubernia, Uyezd and Volost Committees on Work inthe Countryside. 
” 62 So the instructions are addressed to those local functionaries through whom the work in the localitiesis carried on. 
 When agitators, commissars, agents or representatives of the Central Committee are sent they are undoubtedly always given instructions. 
 Clause 9 here says:“Obtain from state farms and from communes help for theneighbouring peasants, immediate and real help. 
” I assumedthat even an agent of the Central Committee would have ahead on his shoulders. 
 If regulations have been approved, how can he demand that they give up a cart, a horse or something? On this score we have instructions enough—some people saythere are too many of them. 
 And an agent of the C. 
C. 
 canmake demands only insofar as the instructions allow it, andno commune manager would allow a cart, a horse or a cow tobe given away. 
 But this is a serious question, because it often spoils our relations with the peasants, and in the Ukraine they may be spoiled a second time, if we are unable toput our political line into effect. 
 It is not difficult to carry it out, and the peasant will be glad of even a little help. 
 It is not enough to adopt an instruction, you must be able to carry it out. 
 If Comrade Sapronov is afraid that a state farm will be robbed of a cow, a horse or a cart, let him sharehis tremendous experience in this field with us and say“Let us give the peasants implements free of charge or atlow cost”. 
 That I can understand. 
 And in any case Clause 9will not be abolished by that, it will, on the contrary, receive confirmation. 
 The relations between the communes and state farms and the neighbouring peasants is one of themost painful aspects of our entire policy. 
 It will be stillmore serious in the Ukraine and tomorrow it will be the samein Siberia. 
 Today we have won over the Siberian peasantideologically by liberating him from Kolchak. 
 But it will not be of any duration unless we can so arrange matters that the peasant gets real assistance, and it stands to reasonthat every agent working in the countryside must be giventhe relevant instructions. 
 And when an agent makes hisreport he must be asked: “Where and in what way did thestate farms help the peasant?” Comrade Sapronov’s direc-tives on this point were incorrect. 
 It is our basic, uncon-ditional duty to make use of the experience of local Partyfunctionaries.

 The workers’ and peasants’ government has made repeated peace proposals to the Entente powers—the message from thePeople’s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs to the Americanrepresentative, Mr. 
 Poole, on August 5, 1918; to PresidentWilson on October 24, 1918; to all Entente governments,through representatives of neutral countries on November 3, 1918; a message from the Sixth All-Russia Congress of Soviets on November 7, 1918; Litvinov’s Note in Stockholm to allEntente representatives on December 23, 1918; then therewere the messages of January 12, January 17 and February 4,1919, and the draft treaty drawn up jointly with Bullitt onMarch 12, 1919; and a message through Nansen on May 7, 1919. 
 The Seventh Congress of Soviets fully approves these many steps taken by the Council of People’s Commissars andthe People’s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, once moreconfirms its lasting desire for peace and again proposes tothe Entente powers, Britain, France, the United States of America, Italy and Japan, individually and collectively, to begin immediately negotiations on peace; the Congressinstructs the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, the Council of People’s Commissars and the People’s Commis-sariat of Foreign Affairs to continue this peace policy sys-tematically (or: to continue this peace policy systematically, taking all appropriate measures to ensure its success). 
 Written on December 2, 1919 First published in 1932 Published according to the manuscript 5 SPEECH SUMMING UP THE DEBATE ON SOVIET POWER IN THE UKRAINE DECEMBER 3 Comrades, there is little for me to say, although unfortunately I shall have to raise objections, not so much toComrade Yakovlev who spoke before me, as to ComradesBubnov and Drobnis who spoke after me. 
 Nevertheless Ishall have to make only a partial comment. 
 Insofar as Comrade Rakovsky’s speech is concerned, I must say that when he said that state farms must be the basisof our communist construction he was wrong. 
 Under no cir-cumstances can we organise our affairs in that way. 
 We mustaccept the fact that we should convert only a very small partof the progressive farms into state farms, otherwise we shall not effect a bloc with the petty peasants—and we need that bloc. 
 When some of the comrades said that I recommend a blocwith the Borotba Party 64 they mistook my meaning. 
 Here I compared the policy that must be pursued in respect of theBorotba Party with the policy we had pursued in respect of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 We were then accused, in the first week after October—at peasant congresses, inci-dentally—of not wanting to use the forces of the peasantryonce we had seized power. 
 In reply I said that we had takenover their programme in its entirety so as to use the forcesof the peasantry—we want to do that, but we don’t want analliance with Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 Comrade Manuilsky, like Comrades Drobnis and Bubnov, was, therefore, making an extremely strange mistake in asserting that I recommend abloc with the Borotba Party. 
 My opinion is that we must demonstrate that we need a bloc with the Ukrainian peasantry, and in order to achieve that bloc we must polemise with the Borotba people in a way that differs from the present polem-ics. 
 All those who spoke about the national question—Com-rades Drobnis and Bubnov and many others spoke about it—show by their criticism of the C. 
C. 
 resolution that they arepursuing the very same policy of “independence” we reprovedthe Kiev people for. 
 Comrade Manuilsky is making a peculiar mistake in thinking that we accused them of independence in the national sense, in the sense of Ukrainian self-determination. 
 We reproved them for their “independence” inthe sense of their not wanting to consider Moscow’s views,the views of the Central Committee in Moscow. 
 The wordwas used jokingly and had a completely different meaning. 
 The issue is now the following. 
 Do we need a bloc with the Ukrainian peasantry, do we need a policy of the type weneeded at the end of 1917 and for many months in 1919?I maintain that we do and that for this reason most of thestate farms must be handed over for actual distribution. 
We need a struggle against kulak farms, we need a struggle against petty-bourgeois prejudices, we need a struggle against the guerrilla bands. 
 The Borotba Party talk a lotabout the national question but they say nothing about theguerrillas. 
 We must demand that the Borotba people disbandthe teachers’ union even though it uses the Ukrainian lan-guage and bears the state seal of the Ukraine—it must be disbanded for the sake of those principles of proletarian com-munist policy for which we disbanded our own All-RussiaTeachers’ Union; we disbanded it because it did not imple-ment the principles of proletarian dictatorship but defendedthe interests and pursued the policy of the petty bourgeoisie. 
 First published in 1932 Published according to the verbatim report SPEEC H DELIVERE D AT THE FIRS T CONGRESS OF AGRICULTURA L COMMUNE S AND AGRICULTURAL ARTEL S65 DECEMBER 4, 1919 Comrades, I am very glad to greet your first congress of agricultural communes and agricultural artels on behalf of the government. 
 Of course, from all the activities ofthe Soviet government you know what tremendous signifi-cance we attach to the communes, artels, and all organisations generally that aim at transforming and at gradually assist-ing the transformation of small, individual peasant farminginto socialised, co-operative, or artel farming. 
 You are awarethat the Soviet government long ago allotted the sum of onethousand million rubles to assist efforts of this kind. 
 66 The Statute on Socialist Agrarian Measures67 particularly stresses the significance of communes, artels, and all enter-prises for the joint cultivation of the land, and the Sovietgovernment is exerting every effort to ensure that this lawshall not remain on paper only, but shall really produce thebenefits it is intended to produce. 
 The importance of all enterprises of this kind is tremen-dous, because if the old, poverty-stricken peasant farmingremains unchanged there can be no question of building up astable socialist society. 
 Only if we succeed in proving to thepeasants in practice the advantages of common, collective, co-operative, artel cultivation of the soil, only if we succeedin helping the peasant by means of co-operative or artel farming, will the working class, which wields state power, be really able to convince the peasant that its policy is correctand thus secure the real and lasting following of the millions of peasants. 
 It is therefore impossible to exaggerate the importance of every measure intended to encourage co-opera-tive, artel forms of farming. 
 We have millions of individual farms in our country, scattered and dispersed throughoutremote rural districts. 
 It would be absolutely absurd toattempt to reshape these farms in any rapid way, by issuingan order or bringing pressure to bear from without. 
 Wefully realise that we can influence the millions of small peasant farms only gradually and cautiously and only by a successful practical example, for the peasants are fartoo practical and cling far too tenaciously to the oldmethods of farming to consent to any serious change merelyon the basis of advice or book instructions. 
 That is im-possible, and it would be absurd. 
 Only when it has been proved in practice, by experience comprehensible to the peas-ants, that the transition to the co-operative, artel form offarming is essential and possible, shall we be entitled to saythat in this vast peasant country, Russia, an importantstep towards socialist agriculture has been taken. 
 Con-sequently, the vast importance that attaches to communes, artels, and co-operative farms lays on all of you tremendous state and socialist obligations and naturally makes itimperative for the Soviet government and its representativesto treat this question with especial attention and caution. 
 In our law on socialist agrarian measures it is stated that we consider it the absolute duty of all co-operative, artel agricultural enterprises not to isolate and sever them-selves from the surrounding peasant population, but to affordthem assistance. 
 This is stipulated in the law, it is repeatedin the rules of all the communes, artels, and co-operatives;it is constantly stressed in the instructions and rulings ofour Commissariat of Agriculture and of all Soviet govern-ment bodies. 
 But the whole point is to find a really practical method of putting this into effect. 
 I am still not convincedthat we have overcome this principal difficulty. 
 And I shouldlike your congress, at which practical workers in collectivefarming from all parts of Russia have the opportunity ofsharing their experience, to put an end to all doubts and to prove that we are mastering, are beginning to master in practice, the task of consolidating the artels, co-operativefarms, and communes and every form of enterprise for collective and socialised farming generally. 
 But in order to prove this, practical results are required. 
 When we read the rules of the agricultural communes, or books devoted to this question, it might appear that wedevote too much space in them to propaganda and the theoreti-cal justification of the need to organise communes. 
 Of course,that is necessary, for without detailed propaganda, withoutexplaining the advantages of co-operative farming, and with-out repeating this idea thousands and thousands of times we cannot expect the broad masses of peasants to take aninterest in it and undertake practical tests of the methodsof carrying it into effect. 
 Of course, propaganda is necessary,and there is no need to fear repetition, for what may appearto us to be repetition is most likely for hundreds and thou-sands of peasants not repetition, but a truth revealed for the first time. 
 You may think that we are devoting too muchattention to propaganda, but it must be said that we oughtto devote a hundred times more. 
 And when I say this, I meanit in the sense that if we go to the peasant with generalexplanations of the advantages of organising agricultural communes, and at the same time are unable in actual fact to show the practical advantage that will accrue to him fromco-operative, artel farms, he will not have the slightestconfidence in our propaganda. 
 The law says that the communes, artels, and co-opera-tive farms must assist the surrounding peasant population. 
 But the state, the workers’ government, is providing a fund of one thousand million rubles for the purpose of assistingthe agricultural communes and artels. 
 And, of course, ifany commune were to assist the peasants out of this fund I amafraid it would only arouse ridicule among the peasants. 
And it would be absolutely justified. 
 Every peasant will say: “It goes without saying that if you are getting a fund of one thousand million rubles it means nothing to you tothrow a little our way. 
” I am afraid the peasant will onlyjeer, for he pays considerable attention to this matter, andis very distrustful of it. 
 He has been accustomed for centuriesto expect only oppression from the state, and he is there-fore in the habit of regarding everything that comes from the state with suspicion. 
 And if the agricultural communesgive assistance to the peasants merely for the purpose of fulfilling the letter of the law, such assistance will be not only useless but harmful. 
 For the name “agricultural com-mune” is a great one; it is associated with the conception of communism. 
 It will be a good thing if the communes;show in practice that they are indeed seriously workingfor the improvement of peasant farming; that will undoubted-ly enhance the prestige of the Communists and the CommunistParty. 
 But it has frequently happened that the communes have only succeeded in provoking a negative attitude among the peasantry, and the word “commune” has even at times becomea call to fight communism. 
 And this happened not only whenstupid attempts were made to drive the peasants into the com-munes by force. 
 The absurdity of this was so obvious thatthe Soviet government long ago forbade it. 
 And I hope that if isolated examples of such coercion are to be met with now, they are very few, and that you will take advantage of thepresent congress to see to it that the last trace of this out-rage is swept from the face of the Soviet Republic, and thatthe neighbouring peasant population may not be able topoint to a single instance in support of the old opinion that membership of a commune is in one way or another associated with coercion. 
 But even if we eliminate this old shortcoming, completely suppress this outrage, it will still be only a small fractionof what has to be done. 
 For it will still be necessary forthe state to help the communes, and we would not be Com-munists and champions of socialist economy if we did not give state aid to every kind of collective agricultural enter-prise. 
 We must do so because it is in accordance with allour aims, and because we know perfectly well that theseco-operatives, artels, and collective organisations are innova-tions, and if support is not given them by the working class in power they will not take root. 
 In order that they should take root, and in view of the fact that the state is affordingthem monetary and every other kind of support, we must seeto it that they do not provoke the ridicule of the peasants. 
What we must be most careful about is that the peasantsshould not say of members of communes, artels and co-opera-tives that they are state pensioners, that they differ from the peasants only by the fact that they are receiving privi-leges. 
 If we are to give land and subsidies for building /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR purposes out of the thousand-million-ruble fund, any fool will live somewhat better than the ordinary peasant. 
 What is there communistic here, the peasant will ask, and where is the improvement? What are we to respect them for? If youpick out a few score or a few hundred individuals and givethem a thousand million, of course they will work. 
 Such an attitude on the part of the peasants is most to be feared, and I should like to draw the attention of the comrades assembled at the congress to this. 
 The problem must be solved practically, so as to enable us to say that we havenot only averted this danger, but have also found meanswhereby the peasant will not be led to think in this way,but will, on the contrary, find in every commune and artelsomething which the state is assisting, will find in them new methods of farming which show their advantages over the old methods not by books and speeches (that is not worth much)but in practice. 
 That is why the problem is so difficult tosolve, and that is why it is hard for us, who have only dryfigures before us, to judge whether we have proved in prac-tice that every commune and every artel is really superior to every enterprise of the old system and that the workers’ government is here helping the peasant. 
 I think that for the practical solution of this problem, it would be very desirable for you, who have a practicalacquaintance with a number of neighbouring communes, artelsand co-operatives, to work out real, practical methods for the verification of the implementation of the law demanding that the agricultural communes give assistance to the sur-rounding population, the way the transition to socialistfarming is being put into effect and what concrete forms it istaking in each commune, artel and co-operative farm, how itis actually being put into practice, how many co-operatives and communes are in fact putting it into practice, and how many are only preparing to do so, how many cases have beenobserved when the communes have given assistance, and whatcharacter this assistance bears—philanthropic or socialist. 
 If out of the aid given them by the state the communes and artels set aside a portion for the peasants, that will only give the peasants grounds far believing that they are merely being helped by kind-hearted people, but will not byany means be proof of transition to a socialist system. 
 The peasants have for ages been accustomed to regard such “kind-hearted people” with suspicion. 
 We must know how to keep a check on the way this new social order has manifested it-self, by what methods it is being proved to the peasants thatco-operative, artel cultivation of the soil is better thanindividual peasant farming, and that it is better not because of state aid. 
 We must be able to show the peasants the prac-tical realisation of this new order even without state aid. 
 Unfortunately, I shall not be able to stay till the end of your congress and I shall therefore be unable to takepart in elaborating these methods of control. 
 But I am cer-tain that with the aid of the comrades in charge of our Com-missariat of Agriculture you will succeed in finding thesemethods. 
 I have read with great satisfaction an article by the People’s Commissar of Agriculture, Comrade Sereda, in which he stresses that the communes and co-operatives mustnot isolate themselves from the surrounding peasant popula-tion but must endeavour to improve the latter’s farms. 
A commune must be organised so that it will serve as a model,and the neighbouring peasants will be attracted to it. 
 We must be able to set them a practical example of how to assist people who are running their farms under the difficultconditions of a shortage of goods and general economic chaos. 
In order to define the practical methods of effecting this,instructions must be drawn up in the greatest detail andshould enumerate all forms of assistance that can be given to neighbouring peasants; the instructions should ask each commune to give an account of what it has done to helpthe peasants, and indicate methods whereby each of theexisting two thousand communes and nearly four thousandartels may become a nucleus capable of strengthening thepeasants’ conviction that collective farming, as a form of transition to socialism, is something of benefit to them, and not a whim or the ravings of a disordered mind. 
 I have already said that the law requires the communes to render assistance to the surrounding peasant population. 
We could not express ourselves otherwise in the law, orgive any practical instructions in it. 
 It was our business to establish the general principles, and to count on polit-ically-conscious comrades in the localities scrupulouslyapplying the law and being able to find a thousand ways of /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR applying it practically in the concrete economic conditions of each given locality. 
 But, of course, every law can be evaded, even under pretence of observing it. 
 And so the law on assisting the peasants, if it is not scrupulously applied,may become a mere game, and lead to results quite contraryto those intended. 
 The communes must develop in such a way that peasant farming conditions will begin to change by contact with them and by the economic help they give, so that every com-mune, artel, and co-operative will be able to make the begin-nings of an improvement in these conditions and put theminto effect, thereby proving to the peasants in practice thatthis change can be only of benefit to them. 
 Naturally, you may think we shall be told that in order to improve farming we need conditions that differ from the present economic chaos caused by four years ofimperialist war and the two years of civil war forced on usby the imperialists. 
 With such conditions as now exist inour country, how can one think of any widespread improve-ment in farming—God grant that we may carry on somehow and not die of starvation! It will be only natural for doubts of this kind to be expressed. 
 But if I had to reply to such objections, I would saythis: assume that owing to the disorganisation of economiclife, to economic chaos, goods shortage, poor transportand the destruction of cattle and implements, an extensive improvement of farming cannot be effected. 
 But there is no doubt that a certain, not extensive, improvement is possiblein a number of individual cases. 
 But let us assume that eventhis cannot be done. 
 Does that mean that the communes can-not produce changes in the life of the neighbouring peasantsand cannot prove to the peasants that collective agricultural enterprises are not an artificial hothouse growth, but a new form of assistance to the working peasants on the part of theworkers’ government, and an aid to the working peasants intheir struggle against the kulaks? I am convinced that evenif the matter is regarded in this way, even if we grant theimpossibility of effecting improvements under the present conditions of economic chaos, a very great deal may never-theless be accomplished if there are conscientious Commu-nists in the communes and artels. 
 To bear this out, I would refer to what in our cities has been called subbotniks. 
 This is the name given to the several hours’ unpaid voluntary work done by city workers over and above the usual working day and devoted to somepublic need. 
 The subbotniks were initiated in Moscow by theworkers of the Moscow-Kazan Railway. 
 One of the appeals ofthe Soviet government pointed out that the Red Army men atthe front are making unprecedented sacrifices, and that, in spite of all the hardships they are obliged to undergo, they are gaining unprecedented victories over our enemies, andat the same time stated that we can clinch our victories onlyif such heroism and such self-sacrifice are displayed notonly at the front, but also in the rear. 
 The Moscow workersresponded to this appeal by organising subbotniks. 
 There can be no doubt that the workers of Moscow are experiencing greater privation and want than the peasants. 
 If you wereto acquaint yourselves with their conditions of life andgive some thought to the fact that in spite of these incredi-bly hard conditions they were able to organise subbotniks,you would agree that no reference to arduous conditions can serve as an excuse for not doing what can be done under any conditions by applying the method of the Moscow work-ers. 
 Nothing helped so much to enhance the prestige ofthe Communist Party in the towns, to increase the respectof non-party workers for the Communists, as these subbot-niks when they ceased to be isolated instances and when non-party workers saw in practice that the members of the governing Communist Party have obligations and duties,and that the Communists admit new members to the Partynot in order that they may enjoy the advantages connectedwith the position of a governing party, but that they mayset an example of real communist labour, i. 
e. 
, labour per-formed gratis. 
 Communism is the highest stage in the development of socialism, when people work because they real-ise the necessity of working for the common good. 
 We knowthat we cannot establish a socialist order now—God grantthat it may be established in our country in our children’stime, or perhaps in our grandchildren’s time. 
 But we say that the members of the governing Communist Party assume the greater burden of the difficulties in the fight against capi-talism, mobilise the best Communists for the front, and demand of such as cannot be used for this purpose that they take part in subbotniks. 
 By organising these subbotniks, which have become wide-spread in every large industrial city, participation in whichthe Party now demands from every one of its members,punishing non-fulfilment even by expulsion from the Party—by applying this method in the communes, artels, andco-operatives, you can, and must, even under the very worst conditions, see to it that the peasant regards every commune, artel, and co-operative as an association which is distin-guished not by the fact that it receives state subsidies, but bythe fact that within it are gathered some of the best working-class people who not only preach socialism for others, butare themselves capable of realising it, who are capable of showing that even under the worst conditions they can con-duct their farms on communist lines and help the surroundingpeasant population in every possible way. 
 On this questionthere can be no such excuses as the goods shortage, or absenceof seed, or loss of cattle. 
 This will be a test which, at allevents, will enable us to say definitely to what extent the difficult task we have taken on ourselves has been carried out in practice. 
 I am certain that this general meeting of representatives of communes, co-operatives and artels will discuss this andwill realise that the application of this method will reallyserve as a powerful instrument for the consolidation of the communes and co-operatives, and will achieve such practi-cal results that nowhere in Russia will there be a singlecase of hostility towards the communes, artels, and co-oper-atives on the part of the peasants. 
 But that is not enough. 
What is required is that the peasants should show a sympa-thetic attitude towards them. 
 For our part, we representa-tives of the Soviet government will do everything in our power to help to bring this about and to see to it that stateassistance from the thousand-million-ruble fund, or fromother sources, shall be forthcoming only in cases when thelabour communes or artels have actually established closercontacts with the life of their peasant neighbours. 
 Unless these conditions are fulfilled, we consider any assistance given to the artels and the co-operatives not only useless, butdefinitely harmful. 
 Assistance given by the communes to the neighbouring peasants must not be regarded as assistance which is merely given out of superfluity; this assistance must be socialist assistance, i. 
e. 
, it must enable the peasants to replace their isolated, individual farming by co-operativefarming. 
 And this can be done only by the subbotnik methodof which I have here spoken. 
 If you learn from the experience of the city workers, who, although living in conditions immeasurably worse than those of the peasants, initiated the movement for subbotniks, I am certain that, with your general and unanimous support, weshall bring about a situation when each of the several thou-sand existing communes and artels will become a genuinenursery for communist ideas and views among the peasants,a practical example showing them that, although it is still a small and feeble growth, it is nevertheless not an artificial, hothouse growth, but a true growth of the new socialistsystem. 
 Only then shall we gain a lasting victory over theold ignorance, impoverishment and want, and only thenwill the difficulties we meet in our future course hold out noterrors for us.

 Delegates greet Lenin with a standing ovation . 
) Comrades, in accordance with a decision of the Presidiumthe political report I am making is to be the joint report ofthe All-Russia Central Executive Committee and the Coun-cil of People’s Commissars. 
 I trust that you are not expecting me to enumerate the laws and administrative measuresintroduced by us during the year under review. 
 No doubt thenewspapers have made you familiar with them. 
 Further-more, small booklets published by most of our commissariatsand describing their main activities during the period under review are being distributed to all Congress delegates; I should like to draw your attention to a number of summarisedresults, which in my opinion may be deduced from ourexperience and which may serve as useful instructions andmaterial for the future work of all comrade delegates in thelocalities. 
 When speaking of the political results and lessons of our activities, the Soviet Republic’s international positionnaturally takes first place. 
 Both prior to October and duringthe October Revolution, we always said that we regard our-selves and can only regard ourselves as one of the contin-gents of the international proletarian army, a contingent which came to the fore, not because of its level of develop-ment and preparedness, but because of Russia’s exceptionalconditions; we always said that the victory of the socialist revolution, therefore, can only be regarded as final when it becomes the victory of the proletariat in at least several advanced countries. 
 It was in this respect that we experi-enced the greatest difficulties. 
 Our banking on the world revolution, if you can call it that, has on the whole been fully justified. 
 But from thepoint of view of the speed of its development we have enduredan exceptionally difficult period; we have seen for our-selves that the revolution’s development in more advanced countries has proved to be considerably slower, considerablymore difficult, considerably more complicated. 
 This shouldnot surprise us for it was naturally easier for a country suchas Russia to start a socialist revolution than it is for theadvanced countries. 
 But, in any case, this slower, more complicated, more zigzag development of the socialist revolution in Western Europe has burdened us with incredi-ble difficulties. 
 The question that primarily comes to mind is:how was it possible for such a miracle to have occurred, forSoviet power to have held out for two years in a backward,ruined and war-weary country, in the face of the stubborn struggle waged against it first by German imperialism, which at that time was considered omnipotent, and then by Ententeimperialism, which a year ago settled accounts with Ger-many, had no rivals and lorded it over all the countries onearth? From the point of view of a simple calculation of theforces involved, from the point of view of a military assess-ment of these forces, it really is a miracle, because the En-tente was and continues to be immeasurably stronger than weare. 
 Nevertheless, the year under review is noteworthy mostof all for our having won a tremendous victory, so great avictory that I think we may say without exaggeration thatour main difficulties are already behind us . 
 No matter how great the dangers and difficulties in store for us, the main ones are evidently behind us. 
 We must understand thereasons for this, and, what is most important, must correctlydetermine our future policy, since the future will almostcertainly bring many further attempts by the Entente atintervention, and possibly a rebirth of the previous pred-atory alliance between international and Russian capital-ists to restore the power of the landowners and capitalists,to overthrow Soviet rule in Russia, in short, an alliance pursuing the old aim of extinguishing the centre of the world socialist conflagration—the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. 
 Examining the history of the Entente intervention and its political lesson for us from this point of view, I wouldsay that it could be divided into three main stages, eachof which has successively given us full and lasting victory. 
 The first stage, naturally the most convenient and easiest for the Entente countries, involved their attempt to settle matters with Soviet Russia by using their own troops. 
 Ofcourse, after the Entente countries had defeated Germanythey had armies of millions of men who had not yet openlydeclared for peace and who did not immediately recoverfrom the fright given them by the bogey of German imperial-ism, which had been used to scare them in all the Western countries. 
 At that time, of course, from the military pointof view, and from the point of view of foreign policy, itwould have been easy for the Entente countries to take atenth part of their armies and dispatch them to Russia. 
Note that they completely dominated at sea, that they had complete naval supremacy. 
 Troop transportation and sup-plies were always completely under their control. 
 Had theEntente countries, who hated us as only the bourgeoisie canhate the socialist revolution, then been able to fling even atenth part of their armies against us with any success, therecannot be the slightest doubt that Soviet Russia would have been doomed and would have met the same fate as Hungary. 
 Why did the Entente countries fail to achieve this? They landed troops in Murmansk. 
 The drive into Siberia wasundertaken with the aid of Entente troops, and Japanesetroops continue to hold a distant slice of Eastern Siberia, while there were military units, even if not big ones, from all the Entente states in all parts of Western Siberia. 
 ThenFrench troops were landed in the South of Russia. 
 That wasthe first stage of international intervention in our affairs,the first attempt, so to speak, to crush the Soviets with troopsfrom the Entente’s own countries, i. 
e. 
, with the aid of work-ers and peasants of the more advanced countries, who were splendidly equipped; generally speaking the Ententecountries lacked nothing in the way of technical and material means for the campaign. 
 There were no obstacles confront-ing them. 
 How, then, are we to explain the failure of that attempt? It ended in the Entente countries having to with-draw their troops, because they proved incapable of waginga struggle against revolutionary Soviet Russia. 
 That, com-rades, has always been our main and principal argument. 
From the very outset of the revolution we have said thatwe constitute a party of the international proletariat, and that, however great the difficulties facing the revolution, there would come a time when, at the most decisive moment,the sympathy, the solidarity of the workers oppressed byinternational imperialism would make itself felt. 
 For thiswe were accused of being utopians. 
 But experience has shownthat while we cannot always and in all cases rely on action by the proletariat, at any rate we may say that during these two years of the world’s history we have been proved correcta thousand times. 
 The attempt by the British and French tocrush Soviet Russia with their own troops, an attempt thatpromised them certain and very easy success in a minimumof time, ended in failure: the British troops have left Archan-gel, and the French troops that had landed in the South have all been sent home. 
 Despite the blockade, despite thering drawn around us, news does reach us from WesternEurope, we do get British and French newspapers, even ifonly sporadically, from which we learn that letters sent byBritish soldiers from Archangel Region have somehow reached Britain and been published there. 
 We know that the name of the Frenchwoman, Comrade Jeanne Labourbe, whoengaged in communist activity among French soldiers andworkers and was shot in Odessa, became known to the entireFrench proletariat and became a battle-cry, a name aroundwhich all French workers united for action against interna-tional imperialism despite the apparently insurmountable factional trends of syndicalism. 
 The words of Comrade Ra-dek, who fortunately, as today’s reports state, has been libe-rated by Germany and whom we shall perhaps see soon,that the soil of Russia, aflame with the fire of revolution,would prove inaccessible to the Entente troops—these words, which seemed to be just a writer’s flight of fancy, were ac-tually realised. 
 Despite all our backwardness, despite allthe burden of our struggle, the troops of Britain and France proved incapable of fighting us on our own soil. 
 The result was a victory for us. 
 The first time that they tried to send massive military forces against us—and without them vic-tory is impossible—the only result was that, thanks to theircorrect class instinct, the French and British soldiers broughthome from Russia the very ulcer of Bolshevism that theGerman imperialists were fighting when they expelled ourenvoys from Berlin. 
 69 They thought they would protect themselves in this way against the ulcer of Bolshevism, which now spreads over the whole of Germany in the shape of astrengthened labour movement. 
 The victory we won in com-pelling the evacuation of the British and French troops wasthe greatest of our victories over the Entente countries. 
 Wedeprived them of their soldiers. 
 Our response to the unlimit-ed military and technical superiority of the Entente coun-tries was to deprive them of it through the solidarity of theworking people against the imperialist governments. 
 This revealed how superficial and uncertain it is to judge these so-called democratic countries by accepted criteria. 
Their parliaments have stable bourgeois majorities. 
 This they call “democracy”. 
 Capital dominates and weighs down every-thing and they still resort to military censorship. 
 And theycall that “democracy”. 
 Among the millions of copies of theirnewspapers and magazines you would be hard put to findany but an insignificant few that contain even a hint ofanything favourable about the Bolsheviks. 
 That is why they say: “We are protected against the Bolsheviks, there is order in our countries”, and they call it “democracy”. 
How could it happen that a small section of British soldiersand French sailors were able to compel the withdrawal ofthe Entente troops from Russia? There is something wronghere. 
 It means that even in Britain, France and America the mass of the people are for us; it means that all these external features, as socialists who refuse to betray socialismhave always asserted, are a deception; it means that the bour-geois parliamentary system, bourgeois democracy, bourgeoisfreedom of the press are merely freedom for the capitalists,freedom to bribe public opinion, to exert pressure on it by all the power of money. 
 That is what socialists always said until the imperialist war scattered them to their nationalcamps and turned each national group of socialists into lackeys of their own bourgeoisie. 
 That was said by social-ists before the war, that was always said by the interna-tionalists and Bolsheviks during the war—and it all proved to be absolutely correct. 
 All the external features, all thewindow-dressings, are a fraud; and this is becoming increas-ingly obvious to the people. 
 They all shout about democracy,but in no parliament in the world did they dare to say thatthey were declaring war on Soviet Russia. 
 That is why we read in the numerous French, British and American publi-cations now available the proposal to “place the heads ofstate in the dock for having violated the Constitution, forwaging war on Russia without declaring war”. 
 When andwhere was it sanctioned, what article of the Constitution,what parliament sanctioned it? Where did they gather their parliamentary representatives together, even after taking the precaution to imprison all Bolsheviks and near-Bolshe-viks, to use the expression of the French press? Even underthose conditions they did not dare to state in their parlia-ments that they were fighting Russia. 
 That was why thesplendidly armed, previously undefeated troops of Britain and France were unable to defeat us and departed from Archangel Region in the North, and from the South. 
 That was our first and chief victory, because it was not only a military victory, it was not really a military victoryat all—it was actually a victory of that international soli-darity of the working people for which we began the whole revolution, and which we pointed to and said that, however numerous the trials we would have to undergo, all thesesacrifices would be repaid a hundredfold by the develop-ment of the world revolution, which is inevitable. 
 It wasapparent from the fact that in the sphere where the grossestmaterial factors play the greatest part, namely, in the milita-ry sphere, we defeated the Entente countries by depriving them of the workers and peasants in soldiers’ uniforms. 
 The first victory was followed by the second period of Entente intervention in our affairs. 
 Each nation is headedby a group of politicians who possess wonderful experience,and that is why, after losing this stake, they placed another, taking advantage of their dominant position in the world. 
 There is not a single country, not a single bit of the earth’ssurface, which is not in fact totally dominated by British, French and American finance capital. 
 That was the basis for the new attempt they made, namely, to compel the small countries surrounding Russia, many of which had been libe-rated and had been able to declare themselves independentonly during the war—Poland, Estonia, Finland, Georgia,the Ukraine, etc. 
—to compel these small states to go to waragainst Russia on British, French and American money. 
 You may remember, comrades, that our newspapers report-ed a speech by Churchill, the well-known British Cabinet Minister, in which he said that 14 states would attack Rus-sia and that September would see the fall of Petrograd, andDecember that of Moscow. 
 I heard that Churchill then dis-claimed this report, but it was taken from the SwedishFolkets Dagblad —Politiken of August 25. 
 But even if this source proved unreliable we know full well that Churchill and the British imperialists acted precisely in this way. 
 Weare perfectly well aware that everything was done to exertpressure on Finland, Estonia and other small countries, inorder to persuade them to wage war on Soviet Russia. 
 I hap-pened to read a leading article in The Times , the most in-fluential bourgeois newspaper in Britain, a leader written when Yudenich’s troops, obviously supplied, equippedand conveyed on board Entente transports, were a few verstsfrom Petrograd, and Detskoye Selo had been taken. 
 Thearticle was a veritable onslaught, in which the maximumpressure was exerted—military, diplomatic and historical. 
 British capital flung itself on Finland and faced her with an ultimatum: The eyes of the whole world are on Finland,said the British capitalists, the entire fate of Finland de-pends on whether she understands her role, whether she willhelp to crush the filthy, dirty, bloody wave of Bolshevismand liberate Russia. 
 And in return for this “great and mo-ral” work, for this “noble, civilised” work, Finland was prom-ised so many million pounds, such-and-such a piece ofterritory, and such-and-such benefits. 
 And what was theresult? There was a time when Yudenich’s troops were afew versts away from Petrograd, when Denikin stood tothe north of Orel, when the slightest assistance to them would have quickly settled the fate of Petrograd to the advantage of our enemies, in a minimum of time and at negligiblecost. 
 The entire pressure of the Entente countries was brought to bear on Finland, a country that is up to its neck in debt to them. 
 And not only in debt: Finland cannot carry on for one month without the aid of these countries. 
 But howdid the “miracle” of our having won the battle against suchan enemy happen? And win it we did. 
 Finland did not enterthe war, Yudenich was defeated, so was Denikin, and thatat a time when joint action by them would most surely, most swiftly have settled the whole struggle to the advantage of international capitalism. 
 We won the battle with interna-tional imperialism in this most serious and desperate trialof strength. 
 But how did we do it? How could such a“miracle” have taken place? It took place because the Ententebacked the same card as all capitalist states, which operate wholly and solely by deception and pressure; that was why everything they did aroused such resistance that the resultwas to our advantage. 
 We were very poorly armed, wornout, and we said to the Finnish workers, whom the Finnishbourgeoisie had crushed, “You must not fight against us. 
”The Entente countries appeared strong in their armaments, with all their outward might, with the food they were in a position to supply to these countries, and demanded thatthey fight against us. 
 We won this battle. 
 We won becausethe Entente countries had no troops of their own to flingagainst us, they had to resort to the forces of the small na-tions, but here, not only the workers and peasants, but even the considerable section of that very bourgeoisie that had crushed the working class did not in the end go against us. 
 When the Entente imperialists spoke of democracy and independence, these nations had the impudence from theEntente viewpoint, and foolishness from our viewpoint,to take these promises seriously and to understand indepen-dence as really implying independence, and not a means of enriching the British and French capitalists. 
 They thoughtthat democracy meant living as free men, and not that allAmerican multimillionaires would be able to plunder theircountry, or that every tinpot aristocrat of an officer shouldbe able to behave like a swine and turn into a brazen black-marketeer prepared, for the sake of a few hundred per cent profit, to do the filthiest of jobs. 
 That was how we won!The Entente encountered opposition to its pressure on these small countries, on each of these 14 countries. 
 The Finnish bourgeoisie who employed White Terror to crush tens of thousands of Finnish workers know that this will not be forgotten, and that the German bayonets that made it pos-sible no longer exist—these Finnish bourgeois hate the Bol-sheviks as intensely as an exploiter would hate the workerswho kicked him out. 
 Nevertheless the Finnish bourgeoisiesaid to themselves, “If we follow the instructions of the Entente, that means we shall undoubtedly lose all hope of independence. 
” And this independence was given to them bythe Bolsheviks in November 1917, when Finland had abourgeois government. 
 The attitude of wide sections of theFinnish bourgeoisie, therefore, proved to be one of vacilla-tion. 
 We won the battle with the Entente countries because they counted on the small nations and at the same time repelled them. 
 This experience confirms, on an enormous, global scale, what we have always said. 
 There are two forces on earththat can decide the destiny of mankind. 
 One force is inter-national capitalism, and should it be victorious it will display this force in countless atrocities as may be seen from the history of every small nation’s development. 
 Theother force is the international proletariat that is fightingfor the socialist revolution through the dictatorship of theproletariat, which it calls workers’ democracy. 
 Neither thevacillating elements here in Russia, nor the bourgeoisie of the small countries believed us; they called us utopians or bandits or even worse, for there is no stupid and monstrousaccusation that they will not fling at us. 
 But when theyfaced up squarely to the issue of either going with the Ententecountries and helping them to crush the Bolsheviks, orof helping the Bolsheviks by neutrality, we proved to have won the battle and to have got that neutrality. 
 We had no treaties, whereas Britain, France and America had all sortsof promissory notes, all sorts of treaties; nevertheless thesmall nations did as we wanted them to; they did so notbecause the Polish, Finnish, Lithuanian or Latvian bour-geoisie derived satisfaction from conducting their policy in a way that suited the Bolsheviks—that, of course, is nonsense— but because our definition of the historical forces involvedwas correct, namely, that either brute capital would be victorious, and then, even if it were in the most democratic republic, it would crush all the small nations of the world— or the dictatorship of the proletariat would be victorious, which is the sole hope of all working people and of the small,downtrodden and weak nations. 
 It turned out that we wereright not only in theory, but also in practical world politics. 
When this battle for the troops of Finland and Estonia tookplace we won it, although they could have crushed us with insignificant forces. 
 We won the battle despite the Entente countries having thrown the enormous weight of their finan-cial pressure, their military might, and their food suppliesinto the fray in order to compel Finland to take action. 
 That, comrades, was the second stage of international intervention, our second historic victory. 
 First, we won the workers and peasants away from Britain, France and America. 
 These troops could not fight against us. 
 Secondly,we won away from them these small countries, all of whichare against us, and in which not Soviet, but bourgeois ruledominates. 
 They displayed friendly neutrality towards usand acted contrary to the desires of that mighty world force, the Entente, for it was a beast that wanted to crush them. 
 We witness here on a world scale the same thing that happened to the Siberian peasants, who believed in the Con-stituent Assembly and helped the Socialist-Revolutionariesand Mensheviks to join forces with Kolchak and to strike atus. 
 When they learned to their own cost that Kolchak repre-sented the dictatorship of the very worst exploiters, a plun-derous dictatorship of landowners and capitalists which wasworse than that of the tsar, they organised the tremendousnumber of revolts in Siberia about which comrades havegiven us reliable information, and which now guarantee thecomplete return to us of Siberia, this time politically con-scious. 
 What happened to the Siberian peasant, with all his backwardness and political ignorance, has now happenedon a broader scale, on a world scale, to all the small nations. 
They hated the Bolsheviks; some of them had suppressed theBolsheviks with a bloody hand, with furious White Terror,but when they saw their “liberators”, the British officers, they understood the meaning of British and American “democ-racy”. 
 When representatives of the British and Americanbourgeoisie appeared in Finland and Estonia, the acts of suppression they began were more brazen than those of the Russian imperialists had been, because the Russian imperial-ists had belonged to an older period and did not know how to suppress properly, whereas these people do know, and goabout it thoroughly. 
 That is why this victory at the second stage is a far more lasting one than is apparent at the moment. 
 I am not exag-gerating at all, and consider exaggerations to be extremely dangerous. 
 I have not the slightest doubt that further attempts will be made by the Entente to set against us now one, nowanother of the small states that are our neighbours. 
 Suchattempts will occur because the small states are wholly de-pendent on the Entente, because all this talk about freedom,independence and democracy is sheer hypocrisy, and the Entente may compel them once again to raise their hand against us. 
 But if this attempt was foiled at such a convenientmoment when it was so easy to wage a struggle against us,we may, I think, say definitely that in this respect the maindifficulty is undoubtedly behind us. 
 We are entitled to saythis, and to say it without the slightest exaggeration, fully conscious that the Entente countries possess a tremendous advantage in strength. 
 We have won a lasting victory. 
 At-tempts will be made against us, but we shall defeat them withgreater ease, because the small states, despite their bourgeoissystem, have become convinced by experience, not theory—these gentlemen are theory-proof—that the Entente is a more brazen and predatory brute than the one they have in their minds when they think of the Bolsheviks, the bogeyused to scare children and cultured philistines all overEurope. 
 But our victories were not limited to this. 
 In the first place we won over to our side the workers and peasants of the Entente countries; secondly, we gained the neutrality of the small nations under the Entente’s domination and,thirdly, we began to win over, within the Entente countries,the petty bourgeoisie and educated townsfolk who had beencompletely opposed to us. 
 To prove this I will quote thenewspaper l’Humanité of October 26 which I have here. 
 This newspaper has always belonged to the Second International, was rabidly chauvinistic during the war, adhered to the view-point of socialists similar to our Mensheviks and Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, and still plays the role of a concil-iator; it now announces that it has become convinced of a change in mood among the workers. 
 The paper did not see this in Odessa but on the streets and at meetings in Paris,when the workers stopped everyone who dared say a wordagainst Bolshevik Russia. 
 As politicians who have learned afair amount during the course of several revolutions, as per-sons who understand what sort of force the people are, they dare not say a word in favour of intervention, and are all speaking against it. 
 Moreover, it is not only the socialistswho say this (they call themselves socialists, but for a longtime we have been aware what sort of socialists they are);the same issue of l’Humanité of October 26, which I quoted, contains a statement by a large number of French intel-lectuals, representative of French public opinion. 
 The signa-tories to this statement are headed by Anatole France andinclude Ferdinand Buisson; altogether I counted the namesof 71 bourgeois intellectuals famed throughout France, whostate that they are against intervention in Russia’s affairs,because the blockade of Russia, the attempt to starve her out from which children and the aged are perishing, cannot be tolerated—it is incompatible with culture and civilisa-tion. 
 The well-known French historian Aulard, who supportsthe bourgeois point of view in full, writes in his letter, “Asa Frenchman I am an enemy of the Bolsheviks, as a French-man I support democracy, it is ridiculous to suspect me of the contrary, but when I read that France has invited Germany to participate in the blockade of Russia, when I read thatFrance has approached Germany with this proposal—thenI feel myself blushing with shame. 
” It may be that this isjust an expression of an intellectual’s feelings but we arejustified in saying that this is our third victory, a victory over imperialist France within the country itself. 
 Such is the implication of this statement, feeble and pathetic as itis, the statement of intellectuals whose bark, as we knowfrom hundreds of examples, is far worse than their bite,but who serve as a good barometer, an indicator of the trenddeveloping amongst the petty bourgeoisie, of the way in which public opinion is reacting, permeated as it is with bourgeois sentiment. 
 If we have achieved such results withinFrance herself, where all the bourgeois papers write about us only in the most lying terms, then we say to ourselves: it looks as if a second Dreyfus case70 is beginning in France, only on a much larger scale. 
 At that time the bourgeois intellectuals fought against clerical and military reactionaries,while the working class could not consider it their business,as the objective conditions were absent, the deep revolu-tionary feeling of today did not then exist. 
 And now? If,after the recent electoral victory of the most rabid reaction-aries and in the face of a regime hostile to the Bolsheviks, the French bourgeois intellectuals say that they are ashamedof the alliance between reactionary France and reactionaryGermany for the purpose of starving out the workers and peas-ants of Russia, then we can say to ourselves that this isthe third and greatest of our victories. 
 And I should like to see how, with this situation within the country, Clemen-ceau, Lloyd George and Wilson will carry out the plan offresh attacks on Russia they dream of. 
 Just try it, gentle-men! ( Applause . 
) Comrades, I repeat that it would be a great mistake to jump to hasty conclusions because of all this. 
 There can be no doubt that the imperialists will resume their attempts, but we are absolutely confident that these attempts, nomatter by what powerful forces they may be undertaken, willend in failure. 
 We can say that the Civil War which we con-ducted with such tremendous sacrifices has ended in victory. 
It has been victorious, not only on a Russian scale, but on a world-historical scale. 
 Every argument I have presented to you has been based on the results of the military campaign. 
That is why, I repeat, new attempts are doomed to failurebecause the imperialists have become much weaker and wehave become much stronger after our victory over Kolchak,over Yudenich, and when there are signs that the victory over Denikin, now in its early stages, is imminent. 
 Did not Kolchak have the aid of the all-powerful Entente? Did notthe peasants of the Urals and Siberia, who returned thesmallest number of Bolsheviks to the Constituent Assembly,solidly support the Constituent Assembly front, which at thattime was the front of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolu-tionaries? Were not they the best human material against the Communists? Is it not a fact that Siberia was a countrywith no landed estates and where we were not immediately able to assist the mass of peasants in the same way as we were able to help all other Russian peasants? What did Kolchak lack to defeat us? He lacked what all imperialists lack. 
 He remained an exploiter and had to act in the backwash of aworld war, in circumstances in which he could only babbleabout democracy and freedom, but which made possibleone of two dictatorships—either the dictatorship of theexploiters which frenziedly defends their privileges and insists on payment of interest on the bills, whereby they wish to squeeze millions out of all peoples, or the dictatorship of theworkers which fights the power of the capitalists and wishesto establish firmly the power of the working people. 
 It wasonly because of this that Kolchak came to grief. 
 It was inthis way—not by voting, which is, of course, in certain cir-cumstances not a bad way—that the Siberian and Ural peas-ants actually determined their destiny. 
 In the summer of1918 they were dissatisfied with the Bolsheviks. 
 They sawthat the Bolsheviks forced them to sell their surplus grainat a non-speculative price and so they turned to Kolchak. 
Now the peasant has seen, compared and arrived at a differ-ent conclusion. 
 Despite all he was taught in the past, he has understood, because he has learned from his own experiencewhat many Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks do notwant to understand from theory ( applause )—that there must be one of two dictatorships, that he must choose either thedictatorship of the workers—and this means to assist all work-ing people to throw off the yoke of the exploiters—or the dictatorship of the exploiters. 
 We have won the peasants toour side, we have proved in practice through the most bitterexperience, through unprecedented difficulties that we, asrepresentatives of the working class, can give the peasantsbetter and more successful leadership than any other party. 
 Other parties like to accuse us of carrying on a struggle against the peasants, of being unable to arrive at a properagreement with them, and they all offer their kind and nobleservices to reconcile us with the peasants. 
 We are mostgrateful to you, gentlemen, but we do not think that youwill manage it. 
 We, at any rate, showed long ago that we were able to do this. 
 We did not paint the peasant rosy pictures that told him he would be able to make the transi-tion from capitalist society without iron discipline and the firm rule of the working class; or that merely gathering votes would decide the world-historical problem of the struggle against capital. 
 We said openly that dictatorship is a harsh, severe and even bloody word, but we said thatthe dictatorship of the workers will ensure the end of theyoke of the exploiters, and we proved to be correct. 
 Thepeasant, having experienced both dictatorships, chose thedictatorship of the working class, and will go forward with it to complete victory. 
 ( Applause . 
) Comrades, from what I have said about our international successes it follows—and, I think, it is not necessary todwell at length on this—that we must repeat our peaceproposal in a manner that is calm and business-like to themaximum degree. 
 We must do this because it is a proposal we have made many times, and each time we gained something in the eyes of every educated man, even if he was our enemy,that made him blush with shame. 
 That was the case whenBullitt came here, was received by Comrade Chicherin,talked with him and with me, and when we concluded a pre-liminary agreement on peace in the course of a few hours. 
 And he assured us (those gentlemen like to boast) that Amer-ica is everything, and who would worry about France inface of America’s strength? But when we signed the agree-ment the French and British ministers did this. 
 ( Lenin makes an expressive gesture with his foot . 
 Laughter . 
) Bullitt was left with a useless piece of paper and he was told, “Who would have thought you were naïve and foolish enough to believe in the democracy of Britain and France?” ( Applause . 
) The result is that in the same issue I read the full textof the agreement with Bullitt in French 71—and it was pub-lished in all the British and American newspapers. 
 The resultis that they are showing themselves to the whole world to be either rogues or infants—let them take their choice! (Applause . 
) All the sympathies even of the petty bourgeoi-sie, even of those bourgeois who have any sort of an educa-tion and who recall how they once fought their own tsarsand kings, are on our side, because we signed the hardestpossible peace terms in a business-like manner and said, “The price of the blood of our workers and soldiers is too high for us; we shall pay you businessmen a heavy tribute as theprice of peace; we consent to a heavy tribute to preserve the lives of our workers and peasants. 
” That is why I think there is no reason for us to dwell long on this, and in conclusion I shall read a draft resolution that will express, in the name of the Congress of Soviets, our unwavering desire to pursuea policy of peace. 
 ( Applause . 
) Now I wish to pass from the international and military to the political section of the report. 
 We have gained three tremendous victories over the Entente, and they were not only military victories. 
 They were victories achieved by the dictatorship of the working class,and each victory strengthened our position, and not only be-cause it weakened our enemy and lost him his troops; ourinternational position was strengthened because on eachoccasion we won out in the eyes of all working people and even of many bourgeois. 
 In this connection, the victories which we won over Kolchak and Yudenich, and are nowwinning over Denikin, will make it possible in the future togain much greater sympathy by peaceful means. 
 We have always been accused of terrorism. 
 This is a fa-vourite accusation that is never absent from the columns of the press. 
 We are accused of making terrorism a principle. 
 To this we reply, “You yourselves do not believe this slan-der. 
” The historian Aulard, who sent a letter to l’Humanité , writes, “I have studied history and taught it. 
 When I readthat the Bolsheviks are freaks, monsters and scarecrows,I say that the same things were written about Robespierre and Danton. 
 By no means do I compare these great men to the present Russians, nothing of the sort, there is absolutelyno resemblance between them. 
 But I say as a historian thatyou must not believe every rumour. 
” When a bourgeois his-torian begins speaking in this way we see that the lie beingspread about us is fizzling out. 
 We say that terror was thrust upon us. 
 They forget that terror was provoked by the attack of the all-powerful Entente. 
 Is it not terror forthe world’s fleet to blockade a starving country? Is it notterror for foreign representatives, relying on their so-calleddiplomatic immunity, to organise whiteguard insurrection?You must, after all, take something of a sober view of things. 
 It must be realised that international imperialism has staked everything on suppressing the revolution, that it stops atnothing, and says, “For one officer—one Communist, and we shall will. 
” And they are right. 
 If we had attempted to in-fluence these troops, brought into being by international banditry and brutalised by war—if we had attempted to influence them by words and persuasion or by any means otherthan terror, we would not have held out for even two monthsand we would have been fools. 
 The terror was forced on usby the terror of the Entente, the terror of mighty worldcapitalism which has been throttling the workers and peas-ants, and is condemning them to death by starvation because they are fighting for their country’s freedom. 
 Our everyvictory over this prime cause of and reason for the terrorwill inevitably and invariably mean that we shall be ableto run the country without this method of persuasion andinfluence. 
 What we say about terrorism also applies to our attitude towards all waverers. 
 We are accused of having created extra-ordinarily difficult conditions for the middle sections ofthe population, for the bourgeois intellectuals. 
 We replythat the imperialist war was a continuation of the imperial-ist politics and for this reason it led to revolution. 
 During the imperialist war everyone felt that the war was being conducted by the bourgeoisie in their own selfish interests,that in this war the people died while the bourgeoisie profit-ed. 
 Profit is the basic motive behind the policy of the bour-geoisie in all countries, and it is ruining them and will sealtheir fate. 
 Our war is the continuation of the politics of revolution, and every worker and peasant knows (and if he does not know, then he instinctively feels and sees) that thisis a war of defence against the exploiters, a war demandingthe greatest sacrifices from the workers and peasants, butwhich stops at nothing in order to ensure that these sacrificesare also borne by the other classes. 
 We know that it is more difficult for them than it is for the workers and peasants, because they formerly belonged to a privileged class. 
 But wesay that when it is a case of freeing millions of working peoplefrom exploitation, a government that did not make otherclasses bear the burden would not be a socialist governmentbut a traitor government. 
 We have burdened the middle classes because we have been placed in extraordinarily dif-ficult conditions by the Entente governments. 
 Every stepin our victories—as we see it from the experience of our revolution, though I cannot deal with this in detail—is char-acterised by the fact that through all the waverings and innumerable attempts to return to the past, more and more waverers are becoming convinced that the only real choiceis between the dictatorship of the working people and therule of the exploiters. 
 If these waverers have had a hardtime, it is not the fault of the Bolshevik government, but thefault of the whiteguards, the fault of the Entente; a victory over them will be a real and sound condition for improving the lot of all these classes. 
 In this connection, comrades,I should like, in passing on to the lessons of the politicalexperience inside the country, to say a few words about thesignificance of the war. 
 Our war is the continuation of the politics of revolution , the politics of overthrowing the exploiters, capitalists and landowners. 
 The workers and peasants are therefore drawnto our side despite the infinite gravity of our war. 
 War isnot only a continuation of politics, it is the epitome of po-litics; this unprecedentedly difficult war which the landown-ers and capitalists have brought down on us with the aid of the mighty Entente is political education. 
 The workers and peasants have learned a great deal during this ordeal. 
The workers have learned how to use state power, and how toutilise every step for propaganda and education, how tomake the Red Army, consisting mainly of peasants, an instru-ment for their education, how to make it an instrument for the employment of bourgeois specialists. 
 We know that in their overwhelming majority these bourgeois specialists are,and must be, against us because of their class character; weneed have no doubts on this score. 
 Hundreds and thousands ofthese specialists have betrayed us, and tells of thousandshave come to serve us more faithfully, drawn to us in the course of the struggle itself because that revolutionary enthusiasm which did wonders in the Red Army came fromour having served and satisfied the interests of the workersand peasants. 
 This situation, in which masses of workersand peasants act in harmony and know what they are fight-ing for, has had its effect, and still larger and larger sections of the people who came over to our side from the other camp, some of them unknowingly, have turned and are turning intoour conscious supporters. 
 Comrades, the task which now confronts us is to transfer our war-time experience to the sphere of peaceful construc-tion. 
 There is nothing which gives us so much pleasure or provides us with such an opportunity of greeting the SeventhAll-Russia Congress of Soviets as the turning-point in thehistory of Soviet Russia, as the fact that the main period ofthe civil wars we have been fighting lies behind us, and thatahead of us lies the main period of peaceful construction which means so much to all of us, which we desire, which we must carry out and to which we shall dedicate all our ener-gies and our whole lives. 
 We can now say, on the basis ofthe severe ordeals of the war, that in the main, in the mili-tary and in the international sphere, we have been victorious. 
The path of peaceful construction opens up before us. 
 We have, of course, to remember that the enemy is always watch-ing every step we take and will make many more attemptsto overthrow us by all the means in his power—force,fraud, bribery, conspiracies, etc. 
 Our task is to direct allthe experience gained in war towards the solution of themain problems of peaceful construction which I shall now enumerate. 
 First and foremost there is the question of food supplies , the question of grain . 
 We have pursued a most difficult struggle against prejudices and old customs. 
 On the one hand, the peasant is a work-ing man, who for decades suffered the oppression of thelandowner and the capitalist; with the instinct of the op-pressed man he knows that they are beasts who will walk through seas of blood to regain their power. 
 On the otherhand, the peasant is a proprietor. 
 He wants to sell hisgrain freely, he wants “freedom of trade”, he does not under-stand that the free sale of grain in a starving country meansfreedom to profiteer, freedom for the rich to make profits. 
 And we say that we shall never agree to this, all of us would sooner die than make this concession. 
 We know that in this case we conduct a policy whereby the workers persuade the peasants to loan them grain, becausethe piece of paper the peasants receive in return is not theequivalent of the grain’s value. 
 The peasant sells us grain at fixed prices but does not receive goods in return because we have none; instead he receives a piece of coloured paper. 
He is giving us the grain as a loan and we say to him “If you are a working man, can you deny that this is fair? How can you not agree that it is essential to loan the existing grain surpluses at fixed prices and not to dispose of them by profiteering, which means a return to capitalism, a returnto exploitation, to all that we have fought against?” It wasextremely difficult to do this, and we hesitated a good deal. 
We have taken many steps gropingly and continue to do sobut we have gained some fundamental experience. 
 When you hear the report of Comrade Tsyurupa or of others con-cerned with food supplies you will see that when the govern-ment says to the peasants they must loan their grain theyare becoming accustomed to this system of requisitioning,for we have information from a number of volosts of its 100per cent fulfilment. 
 Although the successes are meagre, they are nevertheless successes, and our food supply policy enables the peasants to understand more and more clearly—if youwant free sale of grain in a ruined country, go back, tryout Kolchak and Denikin! We shall fight against this to thelast drop of blood. 
 There can be no concessions in this mat-ter. 
 On this fundamental question, the question of grain, we shall fight with all our might to prevent profiteering, to ensure that the sale of grain does not enrich the already rich,and that all grain surpluses raised on state land by the effortsof generations of working people become the property of thestate and that now, when the state is impoverished, thesesurpluses should be loaned by the peasants to the workers’ state. 
 If the peasant does this, we shall emerge from all our difficulties, we shall rehabilitate industry, and theworker will repay his debt to the peasant a hundredfold. 
He, the worker, will guarantee the peasant and his childrena livelihood without their having to work for the landownerand the capitalist. 
 That is what we tell the peasant, and he is becoming convinced there is no alternative. 
 The peas-ant is being convinced of this, not so much by us, as by ourenemies, Kolchak and Denikin. 
 They, more than anybodyelse, are giving the peasant practical lessons in living andsending him to our side. 
 However, comrades, after the problem of grain comes the second question —that of fuel . 
 At the moment sufficient stocks of grain have been collected in the grain-growingregions to feed the starving workers of Petrograd and Moscow. 
 But if you walk through the workers’ districts of Moscow you will find them in the grip of the most frightful cold, terrible privations intensified by the fuel problem. 
 Here we are suffering from a desperate crisis, we are lagging behindrequirements. 
 Recently a number of meetings of the Councilof Defence and the Council of People’s Commissars weredevoted entirely to the elaboration of measures to solve thefuel crisis. 
 Comrade Ksandrov has supplied me with figures for my speech which show that we have begun to emerge from this desperate crisis. 
 At the beginning of October16,000 railway trucks were loaded in a week; by the end ofOctober this figure had dropped to 10,000 a week. 
 Thiswas a crisis, a catastrophe; it meant hunger for the workersof a whole number of factories in Moscow, Petrograd and many other places. 
 The results of this catastrophe are still being felt. 
 And then we came to grips with the problem, bent allour energies on solving it, and did the same as we had donein military matters. 
 We said that all politically-consciouspeople must throw their full weight into solving the fuelproblem, not in the old, capitalist way, when the profiteers were given a bonus and enriched themselves on contracts— no, we said, solve this problem in a socialist way, by self-sacrifice; solve this problem in the same way as we saved RedPetrograd, liberated Siberia, the way we gained victory inall those difficult moments, in the face of all the difficultproblems of the revolution, the way that will always bring us victory. 
 We have advanced from loading 12,000 trucks in the last week of October and now load 20,000. 
 We areemerging from this catastrophe, but we are far from havingsolved the problem. 
 It is essential that all workers knowand bear in mind that without bread for the people, withoutbread for industry, that is, without fuel, the country is doomed to calamity. 
 And this applies not only to us. 
 Today’s newspapers carry the news that in France, a victor country,the railways are grinding to a halt. 
 What can you expect ofRussia? France will crawl out of the crisis the capitalistway, that is, through the enrichment of the capitalists andthe continued deprivation of the people. 
 Soviet Russia will emerge from the crisis through the discipline and devotion of the workers, through a firm attitude towards the peasants,that firm attitude which, in the final analysis, the peasant can always understand. 
 The peasant is learning from experi-ence that no matter how difficult the transition, no matter how firm the state rule of the workers, it is the rule of the working man who is fighting for the alliance of the workingpeople, for the complete abolition of all exploitation. 
 A third scourge is assailing us, lice, and the typhus that is mowing down our troops. 
 Comrades, it is impossible toimagine the dreadful situation in the typhus regions, where the population is broken, weakened, without material re-sources, where all life, all public life ceases. 
 To this we say,“Comrades, we must concentrate everything on this prob-lem. 
 Either the lice will defeat socialism, or socialism will defeat the lice! ” And here too, comrades, by using the same methods as elsewhere, we are beginning to achieve success. 
 There are still some doctors, of course, who hold preconceived notions and have no faith in workers’ rule, who preferto draw fees from the rich rather than fight the hard battleagainst typhus. 
 But these are a minority, they are becomingfewer, and the majority see that the people are strugglingfor their very existence, they realise that by their struggle the people desire to solve the fundamental question of pre-serving civilisation. 
 These doctors are behaving in thisarduous and difficult matter with no less devotion than themilitary specialists. 
 They are willing to put themselves atthe service of the working people. 
 I must say that we arebeginning to emerge also from this crisis. 
 Comrade Semashko has given me some information about this work. 
 According to news from the front, 122 doctors and 467 assistants hadarrived at the front by October 1. 
 One hundred and fiftydoctors have been sent from Moscow. 
 We have reason tobelieve that by December 15 another 800 doctors will havearrived at the front to help in the battle against typhus. 
 We must pay great attention to this affliction. 
 We must concentrate on consolidating our foundation— grain, fuel, and the battle against typhus. 
 I particularlywish to mention these matters because a certain lack ofco-ordination has been noted in our socialist construction,and understandably so. 
 When people have decided to trans-form the whole world, it is only natural that inexperienced workers and inexperienced peasants should be drawn intothis work. 
 There can be no doubt that a considerable period must elapse before we are able to determine where our chief attention should be concentrated. 
 It is not surprising that such great historical tasks frequently give rise to great visions, which develop side by side with many small, un-successful dreams. 
 There have been many instances whenwe wanted to build a house from above, starting from a smallupper wing, a cornice, but paid no real attention to the foun-dations. 
 I must tell you that from my own experience, from my observations of the work being performed, it is my opinion that the essential task for our policy is to lay that foundation. 
It is necessary for every worker, every organisation, everyinstitution to bear this in mind at every meeting. 
 If we areable to supply grain, if we succeed in increasing the fuelsupply, if we devote all our efforts to wiping out typhus in Russia—the typhus which comes from a lack of culture, from poverty, backwardness and ignorance—if we devote to thisbloodless war all the strength and experience gained ina bloody war we can be certain that we shall achieve evergreater successes in this work, which is, after all, much easierand much more humane than a war. 
 We have carried out military mobilisation. 
 The parties which were our most uncompromising opponents, which toa far greater extent than others supported and still supportthe ideas of capitalism (the Socialist-Revolutionaries, forinstance), have had to recognise, despite all the accusationsrained on us by the bourgeois imperialists, that the Red Army has become a people’s army. 
 This indicates that in this most difficult task we have achieved the alliance ofthe working class with the great mass of peasants who arecoming over to the side of the working class, and we have,by this means, shown the peasants what is meant by theleadership of the working class. 
 The words “dictatorship of the proletariat” frighten the peasants. 
 In Russia it was a bogey for the peasants but thesewords now recoil on the heads of people who try to use themas a bogey. 
 The peasants now realise that, while the words“dictatorship of the proletariat” are perhaps too fancy Latinwords, in practice they stand for that selfsame Soviet power which transfers the stale apparatus to the workers. 
 This being the case, the dictatorship is the true friend and allyof the working people and the merciless enemy of any form of exploitation. 
 That is why we shall ultimately defeat all imperialists, for we possess a profound source of strength, a deep and extensive reservoir of human material, such as has never been accessible to any bourgeois government andnever will be. 
 We possess the material from which we candraw ever greater and more profound strength starting fromthe most advanced workers and continuing with averageworkers, and even lower down the scale, with labouring peas-ants, poor and greatly impoverished peasants. 
 The Petro-grad comrades have recently said that Petrograd has givenup all its workers and can supply no more. 
 But when a criti-cal hour struck, Petrograd showed itself to be remarkable,as Comrade Zinoviev justly said, it proved to be a townthat seemed able to give birth to new forces. 
 Workers, who had no experience in politics or government, who were con-sidered below the average in political consciousness, drewthemselves up to their full stature, provided the huge forcesfor propaganda, agitation, organisation, and performed newmiracles. 
 We still have a great deal of this source of newmiracles. 
 Every new section of workers and peasants that has not yet been drawn into our work is, nevertheless, our true friend and ally. 
 At the present moment we frequently haveto rely on a very small section of leading workers in govern-ment work. 
 In the course of our Party work and our Sovietpractice we must approach non-party people, non-party work-ers and peasants, more boldly, approach them again and again, not for the purpose of winning them over to our side immediately, or of drawing them into the Party—that isnot so important for us—but of making them understandthat their help is needed to save the country. 
 When thosewhom the landowners and capitalists least of all permittedto participate in running the state are brought to realise that we are calling on them to join us in building the solid foundation for the Socialist Republic our cause will be reallyinvincible. 
 That is why, on the basis of two years’ experience, we can say to you with absolute certainty that every one of ourmilitary victories will greatly hasten the approach of the time—now very near—when we can devote the whole of our energy to peaceful construction. 
 On the basis of experiencegained, we can guarantee that in the next few years we shall perform even greater miracles in peaceful construction than we did in the two years of victorious war against the all-powerful Entente. 
 ( Applause . 
) Comrades, in conclusion, allow me to read to you the draft of a motion which I now put before you. 
 “The Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic wishes to live in peace with all peoples and devote all its effortsto internal development in order to establish the smooth run-ning of production, transport and government affairs on the basis of the Soviet system; this has so far been preventedby the intervention of the Entente and the starvationblockade. 
 “The workers’ and peasants’ government has made frequent peace proposals to the Entente powers—the message from the People’s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs to the American representative, Mr. 
 Poole, on August 5, 1918; to PresidentWilson on October 24, 1918; to all Entente governmentsthrough representatives of neutral countries on November 3,1918, a message from the Sixth All-Russia Congress of Sovietson November 7, 1918; Litvinov’s Note in Stockholm to all Entente representatives on December 23, 1918; then there were the messages of January 12, January 17 and February 4,1919, and the draft treaty drawn up jointly with Bullitt onMarch 12, 1919; and a message through Nansen on May 7,1919. 
 “The Seventh Congress of Soviets fully approves these many steps taken by the Council of People’s Commissars and the People’s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, once moreconfirms its unwavering desire for peace and again proposesto the Entente powers, Britain, France, the United Statesof America, Italy and Japan, individually and collectively,to begin immediately negotiations on peace; the Congress instructs the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, the Council of People’s Commissars and the People’s Commis-sariat of Foreign Affairs to continue this peace policy system-atically, taking all appropriate measures to ensure its success. 
” 2 CONCLUDING SPEECH ON THE REPORT OF THE ALL -RUSSIA CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS DECEMBER 6 (Voices : “Long live Comrade Lenin! Hurrah!” Applause . 
) Comrades, it seems to me that in his speech and by hisdeclaration, Martov has managed to give us an extraordi-narily fine sample of the attitude towards Soviet power of the groups and parties that formerly belonged, and still belong, to the Second International, and against which wehave now founded the Communist International. 
 The differ-ence between Martov’s speech and his declaration musthave struck each one of you—the difference that ComradeSosnovsky stressed in the remark he shouted to Martov from the presidium, “Isn’t that last year’s declaration you have?” Martov’s speech, indeed, most certainly belongs to 1919, tothe end of that year, but his declaration is so compiled thatit contains a complete repetition of what was said in 1918. 
(Applause . 
) And when Martov replied to Sosnovsky by say-ing that the declaration was “for all eternity” I was quite ready to take the Mensheviks under my wing and defend them from Martov. 
 ( Applause . 
 Laughter . 
) I, comrades, have watched the development and activities of the Mensheviks,probably longer and more attentively—which has by no meansbeen pleasant—than anybody else. 
 On the basis of this fif-teen years of study I assert that the declaration, far from being “for all eternity”, will not last a single year ( applause ), be-cause the entire development of the Mensheviks, especiallyin a great period such as has begun in the history of the Russian revolution, reveals the greatest vacillation among them and, taken by and large, this boils down to their parting company with the bourgeoisie and their prejudices, only with the greatest difficulty and against their own will. 
 A numberof times they have fought shy of the dictatorship of the prole-tariat but they are now beginning to approach it—to approachit very slowly but very surely—and I am certain that inanother year they will take a few more steps. 
 And then it will be impossible to repeat that declaration, because if you remove its envelope of general democratic phrases andparliamentary expressions that would do credit to the leaderof a parliamentary opposition, if you cast aside thosespeeches that so many people like but which we find boring,and get down to the real root of the matter, then the entire declaration says “Back to bourgeois democracy” and nothing more. 
 ( Applause . 
) And when we hear people who profess sympathy with us making such declarations we say toourselves, “Yes, the terror and the Cheka 72 are absolutely indispensable. 
” ( Applause . 
) Comrades, so that you will not now accuse me, and so that nobody will be able to accuse me, of picking holes in that declaration, I assert, on the basis of political facts,that a Right Menshevik and a Right Socialist-Revolutionarywould readily subscribe to it with both hands. 
 I have proofof this. 
 The Council of the Party of Right Socialist-Revolu-tionaries from which Volsky and his group had to break away—Volsky is the Chairman of the Constituent Assembly Committee, you heard him speak here—the Council of theRight Socialist-Revolutionaries which met this year hasresolved that they wish to merge with the Menshevik Partywhich they consider close to them. 
 Why? Because RightSocialist-Revolutionaries, who support Mensheviks whose declaration is construed throughout on the same principles as that of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, stand behindthe printing of the things that are in the declaration and inMenshevik publications (which are supposed to be purelytheoretical and which we are wrong in prohibiting, as theBund 73 representative said when she complained that the country does not enjoy full freedom of the press). 
 At that time, after a long struggle, Volsky’s group had to break away. 
That is the mess which shows quite clearly that the matter is not one of our cavilling at the Mensheviks but of the real state of affairs—this is shown by the Socialist-Revolutionary minority group. 
 Here, quite rightly, the Menshevik Rozanov was mentioned, whom Martov and the party would probablyhave expelled—and it is this declaration the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks subscribe to. 
 This means that until now there are two different trends among them—one of them is sorry, weeps, condoles and wishes to return to democracy theoretically, while the other acts. 
 And Martov was wrong in saying I was trying to jus-tify myself on the question of terrorism. 
 That one expressionalone shows how infinitely far the views of the petty-bour-geois democrats are from ours and how close they are to thoseof the Second International. 
 Actually there is nothing at all socialist in them, but the exact opposite. 
 Now that socialism is near, old bourgeois views are again being preached to us. 
I did not try to justify myself, I spoke about a special party,a party that has been created by the war, a party of officerswho were in command throughout the imperialist war, whohave come to the fore in this war and who know what real politics are. 
 When we are told “You must either abolish your Cheka or organise it better” we reply, comrades, bysaying that we do not claim that everything we are doing isof the best and we are ready and willing to learn withoutthe slightest bias. 
 But as those people who were in theConstituent Assembly want to teach us how to organise a security force against sons of landowners, against whiteguard officers, we tell them, “You were in power and fought withKerensky against Kornilov, and you were with Kolchak,and those same whiteguards kicked you out like little chil-dren without a struggle. 
 And after that you still say thatour Cheka is badly organised!” ( Applause . 
) Oh, no, our Cheka is magnificently organised. 
 ( Applause . 
) And when the conspirators in Germany now mistreat workers, when offi-cers led by Field Marshals over there shout “Down with theBerlin government”, when, over there, they can murderCommunist leaders with impunity and when a crowd ofwhiteguards treats leaders of the Second International like children, we see clearly that this collaborationist government is nothing more than a plaything in the hands of the groupof plotters. 
 When we have this example before us, when we are only just stepping out on to the road, these people say “You have exaggerated terror”. 
 How many weeks is it since we discovered the conspiracy in Petrograd ?74 How many weeks is it since Yudenich was a few versts from Petrograd and Denikin a few versts from Orel? Spokesmen of those waveringparties and of that wavering democracy say to us “We areglad that Yudenich and Kolchak have been defeated”. 
 I amquite willing to believe that they are glad because they know what Yudenich and Kolchak had in store for them. 
 ( Applause . 
) I do not suspect these people of insincerity. 
 But I ask them: when the Soviet government is experiencing a difficultperiod and plots are being hatched by bourgeois elementsand when at a critical moment we manage to lay bare theseplots—do they think they are discovered accidentally? Oh, no, not accidentally. 
 They are discovered because the plot-ters live among the masses, because they cannot succeed intheir plots without the workers and peasants and it is therethat, in the long run, they run up against people who go tothat badly organised, as they said here, Cheka and say thatexploiters are gathered in a certain place. 
 ( Applause . 
) And when some people come to us a short time after we have beenin mortal danger and when we are faced with a conspiracythat is obvious to everyone, and tell us that the Constitutionis not being observed and that the Cheka is badly organised,one may say that they have not learned any politics duringthe struggle against the whiteguards, they have not given any thought to their experience of Kerensky, Yudenich and Kolchak and have not been able to draw any practical con-clusions from it. 
 But since, gentlemen, you are beginning tounderstand that Kolchak and Denikin constitute a seriousdanger, that you must choose in favour of Soviet power, itis time for you to drop Martov’s declaration “for all eternity”. 
 (Laughter . 
) The Constitution contains all the experience of our two years of rule, and without that rule, as I said in my speech, and nobody even tried to refute it, without itwe could not have held out for two months, let alone twoyears. 
 Let anyone who wishes to be at all objective aboutSoviet power, if only from the standpoint of an historian and not of a politician who wishes to talk to the working-class masses, act with them and influence them—let himtry to refute that. 
 It is said that the Soviets meet rarely and are not re-elected often enough. 
 It seems to me that such reproaches should not be answered by speeches and resolutions but by deeds. 
 In my opinion the best answer would be for you to finishthe work begun by the Soviet government of assessing howmany elections to uyezd and urban Soviets there have been,how many congresses of Soviets, etc. 
 Comrade Vladimirsky,Deputy People’s Commissar for Internal Affairs, has pub-lished material on the history of those congresses. 
 When I saw that material I said that this is historical material thatproves, among other things, that there has never been in thehistory of civilised nations a country that has applied prole-tarian democracy as widely as we have in Russia. 
 It is saidthat Soviets are not re-elected often enough, that we rarely convene congresses, but I invite every delegate to apply to the relevant bodies for additional questionnaires to be dis-tributed at this Congress on which every delegate can recordon which day, month and year and in which uyezd, town orvillage congresses of Soviets met. 
 If you do this simple joband each of you fills in a questionnaire of that sort you will ob-tain material to complement our incomplete data and which will show that in a time as difficult as war-time, when thecentury-old European constitutions that have become a matterof habit for the West-European people have been almostcompletely suspended, the Soviet Constitution is in forcein the localities to a greater degree than a constitution any-where else in the world insofar as concerns the participation of the masses in government and in the independent solu-tion of government matters at congresses, in the Soviets andat elections. 
 And if it is still said that this is not enough,and if there is criticism and it is asserted that “it is really aterrible crime if your Central Executive Committee has not met”, well, Comrade Trotsky gave a splendid answer to the Bund representative on this score when he said that the Cen-tral Executive Committee was at the front. 
 The representa-tive of the Bund—that Bund which upholds the Sovietplatform and for that reason might really be expected at longlast to understand what the foundation of Soviet power is— said this (I wrote it down), “How strange that the Central Executive Committee was at the front, it could have sentothers. 
” We are fighting against Kolchak, Denikin and the others— there have been a lot of them! It ends with Russian troops chasing them away like children. 
 We are conducting a diffi-cult and victorious war. 
 You know that with every invasionwe had to send all the members of the Central ExecutiveCommittee to the front and then we are told “How strange,they should have found others”. 
 Were we functioning outsidetime and space, or what? Or are we supposed to give birth to Communists ( applause ) at the rate of a few every week? That is something we cannot do; workers who have been tem-pered by several years of struggle and who have acquired thenecessary experience to be able to lead are fewer in ourcountry than in any other. 
 We have to adopt all measuresto train young workers, trainees, and that will take several months, years even. 
 And when this is taking place under very difficult circumstances, we are treated to grins for ourtrouble. 
 These grins only prove a complete failure to under-stand these conditions. 
 It is really a ridiculous intellectual-ist lack of understanding, when we are compelled in thesewar conditions to act differently from the way we have acted up to now. 
 We have to strain our forces to the utmost and for this reason have to give up our best officials and Centraland local Executive Committee members for the front. 
 I amsure that nobody who has any practical experience in adminis-tration will condemn us; he will, on the contrary, approveof our having done the maximum possible to reduce colle-giate bodies belonging to executive committees to a minimum until, under pressure of war, only the executive committeeitself was left, because the functionaries hurried to the frontin the same way as they are now rushing in hundreds andthousands to engage in fuel supply work. 
 That is the foun-dation without which the Soviet Republic cannot exist. 
 And if the less frequent meetings of the Soviets for a few months is the price at which this has to be purchased, thenany sensible worker or peasant will understand the need forit and will approve of it. 
 I have said that in respect of democracy and the democrats we are still being offered the prejudices of bourgeois democ-racy in their entirety. 
 An opposition party has said here that the suppression of the bourgeoisie must be stopped. 
 Oneshould think of what one is saying. 
 What does the suppression of the bourgeoisie mean? The landowner could be sup-pressed and destroyed by abolishing landed proprietorship and transferring the land to the peasants. 
 But can the bourgeoisie be suppressed and destroyed by the abolitionof big capital? Anyone who knows the ABC of Marxism knowsthat the bourgeoisie cannot be suppressed in this way, knowsthat the bourgeoisie is born of commodity production; thepeasant who has a surplus of hundreds of poods of grain that he does not need for his family and does not deliver to the workers’ state as a loan to help the hungry worker, andprofiteers under the prevailing conditions of commodityproduction—what is he? Is he not a bourgeois? Is the bourgeoi-sie not born in this way? On this issue, the grain issue, andon the question of the torments of hunger being suffered by all industrial Russia, do we get any assistance from those who reproach us with not observing the Constitution, withhaving suppressed the bourgeoisie? No! Do they help usin this respect? They hide behind the words “concord ofthe workers and peasants”. 
 That concord, of course, is neces-sary. 
 We showed how we achieve it on October 26, 1917, when we took that part of the programme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries which supports the peasants and put it intooperation in full. 
 In that way we showed that the peasantwho had been exploited by the landowners, who lives by hisown labour and does not profiteer, finds a true protector in theworker sent to him by the central state authority. 
 In this way we have effected concord with the peasants. 
 When we pursue a food policy requiring that surplus grain not neededby the peasant family be given to the workers as a state loan,any objection to it supports profiteering. 
 This still existsamong the petty-bourgeois masses who are accustomed toliving in the bourgeois way. 
 This is a terrible thing, this is a danger to the social revolution! Have the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries ever done anything to help us inthis respect, even the most Left of them? No, they neverhave! And their publications, that we are supposed to permitfor the sake of “principles of liberty” and samples of whichwe have in our possession, show that they never by a single word—to say nothing of deeds—do anything to help us. 
 Until we have fully conquered the old habit, the accursedold gospel of everyone for himself and God for all, we have no alternative but to requisition grain surpluses as a loan to the hungry workers. 
 It is terribly difficult to do this—we know that. 
 Here nothing can be accomplished by force. 
 Neverthe-less it is ridiculous to say that we represent a minority ofthe working class—that can only make one laugh. 
 That couldbe said in Paris, although workers’ meetings there wouldnot listen to such statements either. 
 In a country where thegovernment has been overthrown with unusual ease, where the workers and peasants are defending their own interests arms in hand, where they employ the rifle as the instrumentof their will—to say in such a country that we represent aminority of the working class is absurd. 
 I can understand suchstatements on the lips of Clemenceau, Lloyd George orWilson. 
 They are their words and their ideas! But when the speeches of Wilson, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George, the worst of the predators, the wild beasts of imperialism, are repeatedhere by Martov in the name of the Russian Social-Demo-cratic Labour Party ( laughter ), then I say to myself that we have to be on the alert and to realise that the Cheka isindispensable! ( Applause . 
) All the opposition speakers, the Bund representatives included, accuse us of not abiding by the Constitution. 
I maintain that we observe the Constitution most strictly. 
(Voice from a box : “Oho!”) And although I hear an ironic “Oho!” from a box that was once the royal box and is now theopposition box ( laughter ) I shall nevertheless prove it. 
 (Applause . 
) I will read to you the article of the Constitu-tion that we observe most strictly and which shows that inall our activities we stick to the Constitution. 
 WheneverI have had to speak about the Constitution at meetingsattended by followers of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolu-tionaries there has always been difficulty in finding the text of the Constitution to quote. 
 The meetings, however, were mostly held in halls where there was a Constitutionhanging on the wall. 
 In this hall there is none, but ComradePetrovsky has saved the situation by lending me a pam-phlet entitled Constitution of the R. 
 S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 I shall read Article 23: “Guided by the interests of the working class as a whole, the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 deprives certain persons and certain groups of rights they use to the detriment of the interestsof the socialist revolution. 
” I say once again, comrades, that we have never regarded our activity in general and our Constitution in particular us models of perfection. 
 The question of changes to the Constitution has been raised at this Congress. 
 We agree tomake changes, let us take a look at the changes; they willnot, however, remain constant “for all eternity”. 
 If youstill want to fight, let it be a clean fight. 
 If you want us toabide by the Constitution, why don’t you want us to abide by Article 23? ( Applause . 
) If this is not what you want, then let us discuss whether it is necessary to annul the arti-cle which says we should not go to the people with talk aboutuniversal freedom and the universal equality of the work-ing people. 
 You have made an excellent study of constitu-tional law, but you have learned from old bourgeois text-books. 
 You recall words about “democracy and freedom”, you refer to the Constitution and you recall former words, andyou promise the people everything in order not to fulfilthat promise. 
 We do not promise anything of the sort,we do not propose equality of workers and peasants. 
 You do,so let’s dispute the issue. 
 There shall be complete equality, friendship and a fraternal alliance with those peasants who were exploited by the landowners and capitalists and who arenow working to support their families on land taken from thelandowners. 
 We shall not, however, grant equality to thosepeasants who, because of their old habits, ignorance andavarice, are pulling back towards the bourgeoisie. 
 You use general phrases about freedom and equality for the working people, about democracy and about the equality of workersand peasants. 
 We do not promise that the Constitution willguarantee liberty and equality in general. 
 Freedom—butfor which class and for what purpose? Equality—who shallbe equal to whom? For those who labour, who were exploited for dozens and hundreds of years by the bourgeoisie and who are now fighting against the bourgeoisie? It is so stated inthe Constitution: “The dictatorship of the workers and poorpeasants for the suppression of the bourgeoisie. 
” When youspeak about the Constitution, why don’t you quote thosewords: “for the suppression of the bourgeoisie, for the sup-pression of the profiteers”? Show us a model country, a model of your splendid Menshevik constitution. 
 Perhaps you willfind such a model in the history, say, of Samara, where the Mensheviks were in power. 
 Perhaps you will find it in Geor-gia where the Mensheviks are in power today, where the suppression of the bourgeoisie, the profiteers, is proceeding under conditions of complete freedom and equality, underconditions of consistent democracy and without a Cheka. 
Show us such a model and we shall learn from it. 
 You can-not, however, demonstrate such a model for you know thatin all places where the collaborationists hold power, where the government is Menshevik or semi-Menshevik, feverish, unhampered speculation reigns. 
 And the Vienna that Trotskyjustly spoke about in his speech, where people like FriedrichAdler are in the government and which does not know “the hor-rors of Bolshevism”, is as hungry and tormented as Petrogradand Moscow, but without the knowledge that the Viennese workers at the cost of hunger are breaking a road to victory over the bourgeoisie. 
 Vienna is suffering more from hungerthan Petrograd or Moscow and right there the Austrian andViennese bourgeoisie are committing monstrous acts of specu-lation and plunder in the Viennese streets, in the NevskyProspekt and Kuznetsky Most * of Vienna. 
 You do not abide by the Constitution, but we do when we recognise freedom and equality only for those who help the proletariat defeatthe bourgeoisie. 
 And in Article 23 we say that the land willnot flow with milk and honey during the transition period. 
We say that we have to hold out, not for months, but foryears, in order to complete the transition period. 
 After two years we can say (and we shall most likely be believed) that we are able to hold out for several years only because we haveinscribed in the Constitution that certain persons and groupsare deprived of rights. 
 We do not conceal from whom we havetaken away the rights, we say openly that it is the group ofMensheviks and Right Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 The leaders of the Second International condemned us for this, but we say outright to the group of Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries that we are ready to grant everything, butthey must help us pursue the policy of the working peopleagainst the profiteers, against those who are helping foodprofiteering, those who are helping the bourgeoisie. 
 Insofar *Nevsky Prospekt and Kuznetsky Most were the shopping centres of pre-revolutionary Petrograd and Moscow respectively. 
— Ed. 
 as you prove this to us by deeds we shall free you from what has been done to you by the Constitution, but until then your empty words are mere evasion. 
 Our Constitution is not noted for its rhetoric, it says to the peasants—if you area labouring peasant you possess all rights, but there can beno equality of rights for all in a society in which workers arestarving and where a fight against the bourgeoisie is underway. 
 And it says to the workers—equality for those peasants who are helping in the struggle against the bourgeoisie, but no generalisations! In this field there will be a hard struggle. 
We accept with the greatest pleasure anyone who wants tohelp, irrespective of his past and irrespective of all titles. 
And we know that more and more such people are comingto us from other parties and from among the non-party people and this is a guarantee of our victory. 
 ( Loud applause . 
 Shouts of “Bravo”. 
) /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR 3 SPEECH IN THE ORGANISATION SECTION75 DECEMBER 8 Comrades, I have received a number of notes from dele-gates asking me to speak on this issue. 
 I did not think there was any need for it, and I refrained from speaking untilI received these invitations because I unfortunately havehad no opportunity of acquiring a practical knowledge ofwork in the localities and it stands to reason that the knowl-edge obtained through work in the Council of People’s Commissars is insufficient. 
 I am, furthermore, in complete agreement with what Comrade Trotsky has said and shall,therefore, confine myself to some brief comments. 
 When the question was raised in the Council of People’s Commissars of the state farms and their transfer to gubernialand departments, and when the question of chief administra-tions and central boards was raised, there was no doubt in my mind that there are more than a few counter-revolutionaryelements in both types of institution. 
 But when attemptsare made to accuse the state farms of being particularlycounter-revolutionary institutions it has always seemed tome, and still does, that it is missing the mark, for neither the state farms, nor the chief administrations and central boards, nor any kind of big industrial establishment, or, ingeneral, any central or local organisation administeringa branch of economy of any importance, can and does managewithout solving the problem of the employment of bourgeoisspecialists. 
 It seems to me that attacks on the chief admin-istrations and boards, though fully justified because a thorough purge of them is needed, are nevertheless mistaken,because in the present case this type of institution is chosen indiscriminately from a number of similar institutions. 
 It is, however, as clear as daylight from the work of the Economic Council that on no account must the chief adminis-trations and boards and the state farms be specially selectedin this matter because all our Soviet work, whether in themilitary field, or in the health services, or in education,has everywhere been up against, and is still up against,problems of this sort. 
 We cannot recast the state apparatus and train a sufficient number of workers and peasants to make them fully acquainted with the government of the statewithout the aid of the old specialists. 
 This is the main lessonto be learned from all our organisational work, and thisexperience tells us that in all spheres, including the mili-tary sphere, the old specialists—they are called old because of this—cannot be taken from anywhere except from capital-ist society. 
 That society made possible the training ofspecialists from far too narrow strata of the population, thosethat belonged to the families of landowners and capitalists,with only an insignificant number of peasant origin and onlyfrom among the wealthy peasants at that. 
 If, therefore, we take into consideration the situation in which those people grew up and that in which they are now working, it is abso-lutely inevitable that these specialists, i. 
e. 
, those skilledin administration on a broad, national scale, are to nine-tenths permeated with old bourgeois views and prejudicesand even in those cases when they are not downright traitors (and this is not something that happens occasionally but is a regular feature), even then they are not capable ofunderstanding the new conditions, the new tasks and the newrequirements. 
 On these grounds friction, failures and disorderare apparent everywhere, in all commissariats. 
 It seems to me, therefore, that people are missing the mark when they shout about reactionaries in the state farms, chief administrations and boards, attempting to separate thisquestion from the general one of how to teach a large numberof workers and peasants to administrate on a broad nationalscale. 
 We are doing this at a speed that, if you take intoconsideration the backwardness of the country and the difficulty of our conditions, is certainly unknown in world history. 
 No matter how great that speed is, it still does notsatisfy us, because our requirements in workers and peasants capable of administrative work and acquainted with special branches of administration are tremendous and are not being met even ten, even one per cent. 
 When we are told, or when it is demonstrated at meetings of the Council of Peo-ple’s Commissars, that the state farms everywhere arehiding-places for old landowners who are slightly disguised orare not disguised at all, that nests of the bureaucracy are beingbuilt there, and that similar things are often to be observed in chief administrations and central boards, I never doubt that it is true. 
 But I did say that if you think you can remedythis evil by handing the state farms over to the gubernia landdepartments you are mistaken. 
 Why are there more counter-revolutionary elements left in the chief administrations and central boards and in the state farms than there are in the army? Why are there fewer of them among the military? Because greater attention was,on the whole, paid to the military sphere and more Commu-nists, more workers and peasants were sent there, politicaldepartments worked on a broader scale there, in short, theinfluence of advanced workers and peasants on the entire military apparatus was broader, more profound and more regular. 
 Owing to this we have succeeded, if not in eradicatingthe evil, at least in being close to eradicating it. 
 To this,I say, the greatest attention should be paid. 
 We are taking only the first steps towards getting the state farms in close contact with the neighbouring peasants and with communist groups so that there will be commissars everywhere, not only in the army and not only on paper. 
No matter whether they will be called members of a collegi-um, assistant managers or commissars, there must be indi-vidual responsibility—this and individual management areas necessary as collectivism is essential in discussing basic questions if there is to be no red tape and no opportunity to evade responsibility. 
 We need people who will learn toadminister independently in all cases. 
 If this is done weshall overcome the evil in the best manner. 
 I am in complete agreement, let me say in conclusion, with Comrade Trotsky when he says that here many incorrect attempts have been made to present our disputes as being between workers and peasants and that the question of theadministrations and boards has been woven into the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 In my opinion this is radically wrong. 
 The question of the dictatorship of the proletariat may be raised when the issue is that of suppress-ing the bourgeoisie. 
 Then we have to think about this ques-tion, then we need the dictatorship because only throughit can we suppress the bourgeoisie and place power in thehands of that section of the working people that is capableof acting unwaveringly and attracting to itself ever greater numbers of the vacillating. 
 In the present case we are not faced with anything of the sort. 
 We are discussing how muchmore or how much less centralism is needed in a certainfield at a certain moment. 
 Since the comrades from thelocalities assure us (and Comrade Trotsky and many people’scommissars confirm it) that in recent times in the gubernias and, to a considerable degree, in the uyezds, functionaries of a higher type have appeared (I am constantly hearing suchan assertion also from Comrade Kalinin who has visitedmany places, and from comrades arriving here from the prov-inces), we shall have to take that into consideration andask ourselves whether the matter of centralism is rightly understood in the present instance. 
 I am sure we shall have to undertake a very great deal of this sort of correcting inthe work of Soviet institutions. 
 We are only now beginningto acquire organisational experience in this field. 
 Insofar aswe can see this experience from inside the Council of De-fence and the Council of People’s Commissars, it is quite obvious that it cannot be expressed by any figures and that it is impossible to talk about it in a short speech. 
 We aresure, however, that in the localities work is being done inaccordance with the general instructions of the centralauthorities. 
 This has been achieved only in recent times. 
 This is by no means a question of a conflict between the dictatorship of the proletariat and other social elements. 
 It is a matter of the experience of our Soviet organisationalwork, experience which, in my opinion, does not even con-cern the Constitution. 
 Much has been said here about changesto the Constitution. 
 But I do not think it has anything to dowith this. 
 The Constitution speaks of centralism as the basic principle. 
 This basic principle is so indisputable for all of us (we all learned it from the impressive and even brutalobject-lesson of Kolchak, Yudenich, Denikin and guer-rilla bands) that here it cannot come into question. 
 Nor does Comrade Sapronov reject the basic principle of centralism when it is a matter of granting a people’s commissar or the Council of People’s Commissars the right to challenge acandidate. 
 It is not a constitutional question but one ofpractical convenience. 
 We have to bring pressure to bear,first in one, then in another direction, in order to achievepositive results. 
 When we are talking about gubernia state farm boards, or gubernia land departments, the stress is on placing them under the control of workers and neighbouringpeasants. 
 This is irrespective of whom they are subordinatedto. 
 It seems to me that no changes to the Constitution willever enable you to kick out the hidden landowners or the dis-guised capitalists and bourgeois. 
 We must introduce into our institutions a sufficient number of workers and peasants who are loyal beyond all doubt and who have practical expe-rience as members of small collegiums, as assistants to somemanagers or as commissars. 
 That’s the crux of the matter!In this way you will have an ever greater number of workersand peasants who are learning to administer, and if they go through a complete schooling side by side with the old spe-cialists they will take their places, carry out the sametasks and will train for our civil business, for the manage-ment of industry, for the direction of economic activities,a corps of officers to replace the personnel in the same wayas that is being done in our war department. 
 Therefore, I do not think there is any reason to proceed from considerations of principle as has here sometimes been the case; we mustexamine the question as one of practical experience and notas a constitutional one. 
 If the majority of local function-aries, after an all-round discussion of the problem, come tothe conclusion that gubernia state farm boards should be subordinated to the gubernia land departments—so well and good, we’ll experiment on those lines and then decidethe issue from the point of view of practical experience. 
 Firstof all, however, we have to decide whether we shall get ridof the disguised landowners in this way, whether we shallmake better use of the specialists. 
 Shall we in this way train a larger number of workers and peasants to take over the man-agement themselves? Shall we be drawing the neighbouringpeasantry into the practical check-up of the state farms? Shall we be elaborating practical forms for that check-up? That is what really matters! If we solve these problems I do not think we shall have wasted our time and our labour. 
 Let us try different systems in the different people’s commis-sariats; let us establish one system for state farms, chiefadministrations and central boards and another for the armyor the Commissariat of Health. 
 Our job is to attract, by wayof experiment, large numbers of specialists, then replace them by training a new officers’ corps, a new body of special-ists who will have to learn the extremely difficult, new andcomplicated business of administration. 
 The forms this willtake will not necessarily be identical. 
 Comrade Trotsky wasquite right in saying that this is not written in any of thebooks we might consider our guides, it does not follow from any socialist world outlook, it has not been determined by anybody’s experience but will have to be determined by ourown experience. 
 It seems to me that in this respect we mustpool experience of communist organisation and test it byits practical implementation, so that we shall fully determinehow we must tackle the problems that confront us. 
 4 SPEECH DELIVERED ON THE CLOSING OF THE CONGRESS DECEMBER 9 (Prolonged applause . 
 Delegates and visitors rise and applaud stormily for several minutes . 
) Comrades, I should like to say a few words apropos of the most important itemswe have dealt with at this Congress. 
 We had a brief discussion, comrades, on the question of democracy and Soviet power. 
 Although it may seem at first glance that this discussion was far removed from the burning, practical, day-to-day problems of the SovietRepublic, I nevertheless think that it was far from useless. 
Comrades, in workers’ organisations throughout the worldand very often in bourgeois parliaments, and, in any case,during elections to bourgeois parliaments, there is today the same basic discussion on democracy—which, although many people do not realise it, is the old bourgeois democracy—and on the new, Soviet, power. 
 Old or bourgeoisdemocracy proclaims freedom and equality, equalityirrespective of whether a person owns anything or not,irrespective of whether he is the owner of capital or not; it proclaims freedom for private owners to dispose of land and capital and freedom for those who have neither to sell theirworkers’ hands to a capitalist. 
 Comrades, our Soviet power has made a determined break with that freedom and that equality which is a lie ( applause ) and has said to the working people that socialists who under-stand freedom and equality in the bourgeois way have forgot-ten the germ, the ABC and all the content of socialism. 
 We,and all the socialists who have not yet betrayed socialism, have always exposed the lies, fraud and hypocrisy of bour-geois society that talk about freedom and equality, or, at any rate, about the freedom and equality of elections, although actually the power of the capitalists, the privateownership of land and factories, predetermines not freedombut the oppression and deception of the working people underevery possible kind of “democratic and republican” system. 
 We say that our aim, being the aim of world socialism, is the abolition of classes and that classes are groups of people, one of which lives by the labour of another, one ofwhich appropriates the labour of another. 
 And so, if weare to speak of that freedom and that equality we shall haveto admit, as most of the working people in Russia do, thatno other country has as yet given as much in such a short time for real freedom and real equality, no other country has, in such a short time, given the working people freedomfrom the main class that oppresses them, the class of land-owners and capitalists, and no other country has granted suchequality in respect of the chief means of subsistence, theland. 
 It is along this road, that of emancipation from the exploiting bourgeois classes up to the complete abolition of the classes, that we have begun and are continuing a resolutestruggle for the complete abolition of classes. 
 We know fullwell that those classes have been defeated but not destroyed. 
We know full well that the landowners and capitalists havebeen defeated but not destroyed. 
 The class struggle con-tinues, and the proletariat, together with the poor peasantry, must continue the struggle for the complete abolition ofclasses, attracting to their side all those who stand in themiddle, and by their entire experience, their example ofstruggle they must ensure that all those who until now havestood in the ranks of the wavering are attracted to their side. 
 Comrades, going over to the business of our Congress, I must say that the Seventh Congress, is the first that hasbeen able to devote a lot of time to the practical tasks oforganisation, for the first time we have succeeded in makinga start on a practical discussion, based directly on practical experience, of those tasks that concern the better organisa-tion of Soviet economy and the better organisation of Sovietgovernment. 
 We have, of course, had too little time to deal with this problem in great detail but we have, nevertheless, done a lot here, and all the further work of the Central Execu-tive Committee and of the comrades in the localities willfollow the lines laid down here. 
 In conclusion, comrades, I should like to make special mention of the way the present Congress is to become effec-tive insofar as our international situation is concerned. 
 Comrades, we have here repeated our peace proposal to all the powers and countries of the Entente. 
 We have hereexpressed confidence based on experience that is already veryrich and of a very serious nature—our confidence that themain difficulties are behind us and that we are undoubtedlyemerging victorious from the war forced on us by the Entente, the war that we have been fighting for two years against an enemy considerably stronger than we are. 
 But I think, comrades, that the appeal we have just heard from a representative of our Red Army was neverthe-less very timely. 
 If the main difficulties have been leftbehind, comrades, we have to admit that ahead of us, too, organisational tasks are developing on an extremely broad scale. 
 There can be no doubt that there are still very influen-tial and very strong capitalist groups, groups that areobviously dominant in many countries and that have decidedto continue the war against Soviet Russia to the end, costwhat it may. 
 There can be no doubt that now we have achieved a certain decisive victory we shall have to devote additional efforts, we shall have to bend still greater effortin order to exploit that victory and carry it through to theend. 
 ( Applause . 
) Comrades, there are two things you must not forget— first, our general weakness connected, perhaps, with the Slav character—we are not stable enough, not persistent enough in pursuing the aims we set ourselves—and secondly,experience has shown, once in the East and again in the South,that in a decisive moment we were unable to press hardenough on a fleeing enemy and have allowed him to rise tohis feet again. 
 There can be not a shadow of doubt that governments and the military classes of Western Europe are now drawing up new plans to save Denikin. 
 There cannot bethe slightest doubt that they will try to increase tenfold the aid they have been giving him because they realise how great is the danger threatening him from Soviet Russia. 
 We must, therefore, tell ourselves at a time when the victories are beginning, as we did in times of difficulty, “Comrades,remember that it may now depend on a few weeks or perhapstwo or three months whether we end this war, not merely witha decisive victory, but with the complete destruction of theenemy, or whether we shall condemn tens and hundreds of thousands of people to a lengthy and tormenting war. 
 On the basis of the experience we have acquired we can now saywith full confidence that if we can redouble our effortsthe possibility of not only achieving a final victory, butalso of destr oying the enemy and gaining for ourselves a durable and lengthy peace depends on a few weeks or on two or three months.... 
 ” Therefore, comrades, I should like more than anything to ask each of you on arriving in your locality to presentthis question to every Party organisation, to every Sovietinstitution and to every meeting of workers and peasants—comrades, this winter campaign will most certainly lead to the complete destruction of the enemy if we, encouraged by success and by the clear prospects for Soviet developmentthat now open up before us, regard the forthcoming weeksand months as a period of hard work in which we must re-double our war effort and other work connected with it, andwe shall then in the shortest time destroy the enemy, and put an end to the Civil War, which will open up before us the possibility for peaceful socialist construction for a long time.

) THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS AND THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT The symposium issued by the Socialist-Revolutionaries, A Year of the Russian Revolution. 
 1917-18 (Moscow, Zemlya i Volya Publishers, 1918), contains an extremely interest-ing article by N. 
 V. 
 Svyatitsky: “Results of the All-RussiaConstituent Assembly Elections (Preface)”. 
 The author gives the returns for 54 constituencies out of the total of 79. 
 The author’s survey covers nearly all the gubernias of European Russia and Siberia, only the following beingomitted: Olonets, Estonian, Kaluga, Bessarabian, Podolsk,Orenburg, Yakut and Don gubernias. 
 First of all I shall quote the main returns published by N. 
 V. 
 Svyatitsky and then discuss the political conclusionsto be drawn from them. 
 I The total number of votes polled in the 54 constituencies in November 1917 was 36,262,560. 
 The author gives thefigure of 36,257,960, distributed over seven regions (plusthe Army and Navy), but the figures he gives for the variousparties total up to what I give. 
 The distribution of the votes according to parties is as follows: the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries polled 16. 
5 million votes; if we add the votes polled by the Socialist-Revolutionaries of the other nations (Ukrainians, Moslems, and others), the total will be 20. 
9 million, i. 
e. 
, 58 per cent. 
 The Mensheviks polled 668,064 votes, but if we add the votes polled by the analogous groups of Popular Socialists(312,000), Yedinstvo (25,000), Co-operators (51,000), Ukrainian Social-Democrats (95,000), Ukrainian socialists (507,000), German socialists (44,000) and Finnish socialists (14,000),the total will be 1. 
7 million. 
 The Bolsheviks polled 9,023,963 votes. 
 The Cadets polled 1,856,639 votes. 
 By adding the Associa-tion of Rural Proprietors and Landowners (215,000), theRight groups (292,000), Old Believers (73,000), national-ists—Jews (550,000), Moslems (576,000), Bashkirs (195,000),Letts (67,000), Poles (155,000), Cossacks (79,000), Germans (130,000), Byelorussians (12,000)—and the “lists of various groups and organisations” (418,000), we geta total for the landowning and bourgeois partiesof 4. 
6 million. 
 We know that the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks formed a bloc during the whole period of the revolution from February to October 1917. 
 Moreover, the entire development of events during that period and after itshowed definitely that those two parties together representpetty-bourgeois democracy, which mistakenly imagines it is,and calls itself, socialist, like all the parties of the SecondInternational. 
 Uniting the three main groups of parties in the Constitu-ent Assembly elections, we get the following total: Party of the Proletariat (Bolsheviks) 9.

6 From these figures it is evident that during the Constitu-ent Assembly elections the Bolsheviks were the partyof the proletariat and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the party of the peasantry. 
 In the purely peasant districts, Great-Russian (Volga-Black Earth, Siberia, East-Urals) andUkrainian, the Socialist-Revolutionaries polled 62 -77 per cent. 
 In the industrial centres the Bolsheviks had a major-ity over the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 This majority isunderstated in the district figures given by N. 
 V. 
 Svyatitsky, for he combined the most highly industrialised districts with little industrialised and non-industrial areas. 
 For ex-ample, the gubernia figures of the votes polled by theSocialist-Revolutionary, Bolshevik, and Cadet parties, andby the “national and other groups”, show the following: In the Northern Region the Bolshevik majority seems to be insignificant: 40 per cent against 38 per cent. 
 But in this region non-industrial areas (Archangel, Vologda, Novgorodand Pskov gubernias), where the Socialist-Revolution-aries predominate, are combined with industrial areas: *The author divides Russia into districts in a rather unusual way: Northern : Archangel, Vologda, Petrograd, Novgorod, Pskov, Baltic. 
 Central-Industrial : Vladimir, Kostroma, Moscow, Nizhni-Novgorod, Ryazan, Tula, Tver Yaroslavl. 
 Volga-Black Earth : Astrakhan, Voro-nezh, Kursk, Orel Penza Samara, Saratov, Simbirsk, Tambov. 
 Western : Vitebsk, Minsk, Mogilev, Smolensk. 
 East-Urals : Vyatka, Kazan, Perm, Ufa. 
 Siberia : Tobolsk, Tomsk, Altai, Yeniseisk, Irkutsk, Transbaikal, Amur. 
 The Ukraine : Volhynia, Ekaterinoslav, Kiev, Poltava, Taurida, Kharkov, Kherson, Chernigov. 
 **Svyatitsky obtains the figure in brackets, 62 per cent, by adding the Moslem and Chuvash Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 *** The figure in brackets, 77 per cent, is mine, obtained by adding the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
Per cent Per cent Petrograd City—Bolsheviks 45 per cent (of the votes), Socialist-Revolutionaries 16 per cent; Petrograd Gubernia— Bolsheviks 50 per cent, Socialist-Revolutionaries 26 per cent; Baltic—Bolsheviks 72 per cent, Socialist-Revolutionaries—0. 
 In the Central-Industrial Region the Bolsheviks in Mos-cow Gubernia polled 56 per cent and the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries 25 per cent; in Moscow City the Bolsheviks polled50 per cent and the Socialist-Revolutionaries 8 per cent; in Tver Gubernia the Bolsheviks polled 54 per cent and the Socialist-Revolutionaries 39 per cent; in Vladimir Guberniathe Bolsheviks polled 56 per cent and the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries 32 per cent. 
 Let us note, in passing, how ridiculous, in face of such facts, is the talk about the Bolsheviks having only a “minor-ity” of the proletariat behind them! And we hear this talk from the Mensheviks (668,000 votes, and with Transcaucasiaanother 700,000-800,000, against 9,000,000 votes polledby the Bolsheviks), and also from the social-traitors of theSecond International. 
 II How could such a miracle have occurred? How could the Bolsheviks, who polled one-fourth of the votes, have won avictory over the petty-bourgeois democrats, who were inalliance (coalition) with the bourgeoisie, and who togetherwith the bourgeoisie polled three-fourths of the votes? To deny this victory now, after the Entente—the all-mighty Entente—has been helping the enemies of Bolshe-vism for two years, is simply ridiculous. 
 The point is that the fanatical political hatred of those who have been defeated, including all the supporters of theSecond International, prevents them from even raising seriously the extremely interesting historical and political question of why the Bolsheviks were victorious. 
 The pointis that this is a “miracle” only from the standpoint ofvulgar petty-bourgeois democracy, the abysmal ignoranceand deep-rooted prejudices of which are exposed by thisquestion and the answer to it. 
 From the standpoint of the class struggle and socialism, from that standpoint, which the Second Internationalhas abandoned, the answer to the question is indisputable. 
 The Bolsheviks were victorious, first of all, because they had behind them the vast majority of the proletariat, which included the most class-conscious, energetic and revolutionary section, the real vanguard, of that advancedclass. 
 Take the two metropolitan cities, Petrograd and Moscow. 
 The total number of votes polled during the ConstituentAssembly elections was 1,765,100, of which Socialist-Revolutionaries polled 218,000, Bolsheviks—837,000 and Cadets—515,400. 
 No matter how much the petty-bourgeois democrats who call themselves socialists and Social-Democrats (the Cher-novs, Martovs, Kautskys, Longuets, MacDonalds and Co. 
)may beat their breasts and bow to the Goddesses of “equality”, “universal suffrage”, “democracy”, “pure democracy”, or “consistent democracy”, it does not do away with theeconomic and political fact of the inequality of town and country. 
 That fact is inevitable under capitalism in general, and in the period of transition from capitalism to communism in particular. 
 The town cannot be equal to the country. 
 The country cannot be equal to the town under the historical conditionsof this epoch. 
 The town inevitably leads the country. 
 The country inevitably follows the town . 
 The only question is which class, of the “urban” classes, will succeed in leading the country, will cope with this task, and what forms will leadership by the town assume? In November 1917, the Bolsheviks had behind them the vast majority of the proletariat. 
 By that time, the partywhich competed with the Bolsheviks among the proletariat,the Menshevik party, had been utterly defeated (9,000,000 votes against 1,400,000, if we add together 668,000 and 700,000-800,000 in Transcaucasia). 
 Moreover, that partywas defeated in the fifteen-year struggle (1903-17) whichsteeled , enlightened and organised the vanguard of the proletariat, and forged it into a genuine revolutionary vanguard. 
 Furthermore, the first revolution, that of 1905, prepared the subsequent development, determined in a practical way the relations between-the two parties, and served as the general rehearsal of the great events of 1917-19. 
 The petty-bourgeois democrats who call themselves socialists of the Second International are fond of dismissing this extremely important historical question with honeyed phrases about the benefits of proletarian “unity”. 
 When theyuse these honeyed phrases they forget the historical fact of theaccumulation of opportunism in the working-class movement of 1871-1914; they forget (or do not want) to think about the causes of the collapse of opportunism in August 1914, about the causes of the split in international socialism in 1914-17. 
 Unless the revolutionary section of the proletariat is thoroughly prepared in every way for the expulsion andsuppression of opportunism it is useless even thinking aboutthe dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 That is the lesson of the Russian revolution which should be taken to heart by the leaders of the “independent” German Social-Democrats, 76 French socialists, and so forth, who now want to evadethe issue by means of verbal recognition of the dictatorshipof the proletariat. 
 To continue. 
 The Bolsheviks had behind them not only the majority of the proletariat, not only the revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat which had been steeled in thelong and persevering struggle against opportunism; they had,if it is permissible to use a military term, a powerful“striking force” in the metropolitan cities. 
 An overwhelming superiority of forces at the decisive point at the decisive moment—this “law” of military success is also the law of political success, especially in that fierce,seething class war which is called revolution. 
 Capitals, or, in general, big commercial and industrial centres (here in Russia the two coincided, but they do noteverywhere coincide), to a considerable degree decide the political fate of a nation, provided, of course, the centres are supported by sufficient local, rural forces, even if thatsupport does not come immediately. 
 In the two chief cities, in the two principal commercial and industrial centres of Russia, the Bolsheviks had an over-whelming, decisive superiority of forces. 
 Here our forces were nearly four times as great as those of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 We had here more than the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Cadets put together . 
 Moreover, our adver-saries were split up, for the “coalition” of the Cadets with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks (in Petrograd and Moscow the Mensheviks polled only 3 per cent of the votes) was utterly discredited among the working people. 
 Realunity between the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Menshe-viks and the Cadets against us was quite out of the questionat that time. 
 * It will be remembered that in November 1917, even the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Men-sheviks, who were a hundred times nearer to the idea of a bloc with the Cadets than the Socialist-Revolutionary andMenshevik workers and peasants, even those leaders thought(and bargained with us) about a bloc with the Bolshevikswithout the Cadets! We were certain of winning Petrograd and Moscow in October-November 1917, for we had an overwhelming superi-ority of forces and the most thorough political preparation,insofar as concerns both the assembly, concentration,training, testing and battle-hardening of the Bolshevik“armies”, and the disintegration, exhaustion, disunity anddemoralisation of the “enemy’s” “armies”. 
 And being certain of winning the two metropolitan cities, the two centres of the capitalist state machine (economic andpolitical), by a swift, decisive blow, we, in spite of thefurious resistance of the bureaucracy and intelligentsia,despite sabotage, and so forth, were able with the aid ofthe central apparatus of state power to prove by deeds to the non-proletarian working people that the proletariat was their only reliable ally, friend and leader. 
 III But before passing on to this most important question— that of the attitude of the proletariat towards the non-proletarian working people—we must deal with the armed forces . 
 *It is interesting to note that the above figures also reveal the unity and solidarity of the party of the proletariat and the extremelyfragmented state of the parties of the petty bourgeoisie and of the bourgeoisie. 
 The flower of the people’s forces went to form the army during the imperialist war; the opportunist scoundrels of the Second International (not only the social-chauvinists, i. 
e. 
, the Scheidemanns and Renaudels who directly went overto the side of “defence of the fatherland”, but also the Cen-trists 77) by their words and deeds strengthened the subordi-nation of the armed forces to the leadership of the imperialistrobbers of both the German and Anglo-French groups, but the real proletarian revolutionaries never forgot what Marx said in 1870: “The bourgeoisie will give the proletariatpractice in arms!” 78 Only the Austro-German and Anglo-Franco-Russian betrayers of socialism could talk about“defence of the fatherland” in the imperialist war, i. 
e. 
, awar that was predatory on both sides; the proletarian revo-lutionaries, however (from August 1914 onwards), turned all their attention to revolutionising the armed forces, toutilising them against the imperialist robber bourgeoisie, to converting the unjust and predatory war between the twogroups of imperialist predators into a just and legitimatewar of the proletarians and oppressed working people in each country against “their own”, “national” bour-geoisie. 
 During 1914-17 the betrayers of socialism did not make preparations to use the armed forces against the imperialist government of each nation. 
 The Bolsheviks prepared for this by the whole of their propaganda, agitation and underground organisational work from August 1914 onwards. 
 Of course, the betrayers of social-ism, the Scheidemanns and Kautskys of all nations, got outof this by talking about the demoralisation of the armed forces by Bolshevik agitation, but we are proud of the fact that we performed our duty in demoralising the forces of our class enemy, in winning away from him the armed masses of the workers and peasants for the struggle against the exploiters. 
 The results of our work were seen in, among other things, the votes polled in the Constituent Assembly elections inNovember 1917, in which, in Russia, the armed forces also participated.

3 &? Summary: the Socialist-Revolutionaries polled 1,885,100 votes; the Bolsheviks polled 1,671,300 votes. 
 If to the lat-ter we add the 120,000 votes (approximately) polled in theBaltic Fleet, the total votes polled by the Bolsheviks willbe 1,791,300. 
 The Bolsheviks, therefore, polled a little less than the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 And so, by October-November 1917, the armed forces were half Bolshevik . 
 If that had not been the case we could not have been victorious. 
 We polled nearly half the votes of the armed forces as a whole, but had an overwhelming majority on the frontsnearest to the metropolitan cities and, in general, on those not too far away. 
 If we leave out the Caucasian Front, theBolsheviks obtained on the whole a majority over theSocialist-Revolutionaries. 
 And if we take the Northern and Western fronts, the votes polled by the Bolsheviks will amount to over one million , compared with 420,000 votes polled by the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 *The figure is Approximate. 
 Two Bolsheviks were elected. 
 N. 
 V. 
 Svyatitsky counts an average of 60,000 votes per elected person. 
 That is why I give the figure 120,000. 
 **No information is given as to which party polled 19,500 votes in the Black Sea Fleet. 
 The other figures in this column evidently apply almost entirely to the Ukrainian socialists for 10 Ukrainian socialists and one Social-Democrat (i. 
e. 
, a Menshevik) were elected. 
 Thus, in the armed forces, too, the Bolsheviks already had a political “striking force ”, by November 1917, which ensured them an overwhelming superiority of forces at the decisive point at the decisive moment. 
 Resistance on thepart of the armed forces to the October Revolution of theproletariat, to the winning of political power by the prole-tariat, was entirely out of the question, considering that theBolsheviks had an enormous majority on the Northern and Western fronts, while on the other fronts, far removed from the centre, the Bolsheviks had the time and opportunity towin the peasants away from the Socialist-Revolutionary Party . 
 With this we shall deal later. 
 IV On the basis of the returns of the Constituent Assembly elections we have studied the three conditions whichdetermined the victory of Bolshevism: (1) an overwhelmingmajority among the proletariat; (2) almost half of thearmed forces; (3) an overwhelming superiority of forces at thedecisive moment at the decisive points, namely: in Petrograd and Moscow and on the war fronts near the centre. 
 But these conditions could have ensured only a very short-lived and unstable victory had the Bolsheviks beenunable to win to their side the majority of the non-proletarian working masses, to win them from the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the other petty-bourgeois parties. 
 That is the main thing. 
 And the chief reason why the “socialists” (read: petty-bourgeois democrats) of the Second International fail tounderstand the dictatorship of the proletariat is that theyfail to understand that state power in the hands of one class , the proletariat, can and must become an instrument for winning to the side of the proletariat the non-proletarian working masses , a n instrument for winning those masses from the bourgeoisieand from the petty-bourgeois parties . 
 Filled with petty-bourgeois prejudices, forgetting the most important thing in the teachings of Marx about the state, the “socialists” of the Second International regard state power as something holy, as an idol, or as the result of for-mal voting, the absolute of “consistent democracy” (or what-ever else they call this nonsense). 
 They fail to see that state power is simply an instrument which different classes can and must use (and know how to use) for their class aims . 
 The bourgeoisie has used state power as an instrument of the capitalist class against the proletariat, against allthe working people. 
 That has been the case in the most demo-cratic bourgeois republics. 
 Only the betrayers of Marxismhave “forgotten” this. 
 The proletariat must (after mustering sufficiently strong political and military “striking forces”) overthrow thebourgeoisie, take state power from it in order to use thatinstrument for its class aims. 
 What are the class aims of the proletariat?Suppress the resistance of the bourgeoisie; Neutralise the peasantry and, if possible, win them over—at any rate the majority of the labouring, non-exploiting section—to the side of the proletariat; Organise large-scale machine production, using factories, and means of production in general, expropriated from thebourgeoisie; Organise socialism on the ruins of capitalism. 
 * * * In mockery of the teachings of Marx, those gentlemen, the opportunists, including the Kautskyites, “teach” the peo-ple that the proletariat must first win a majority by meansof universal suffrage, then obtain state power, by the voteof that majority, and only after that, on the basis of “con-sistent” (some call it “pure”) democracy, organise socialism. 
 But we say on the basis of the teachings of Marx and the experience of the Russian revolution: the proletariat must first overthrow the bourgeoisie and win for itself state power, and then use that state power, that is, the dictatorship of the proletariat, as an instrumentof its class for the purpose of winning the sympathy of themajority of the working people. 
 * * * How can state power in the hands of the proletariat become the instrument of its class struggle for influence over the non-proletarian working people, of the struggle to draw them to its side, to win them over, to wrest them from thebourgeoisie? First, the proletariat achieves this not by putting into operation the old apparatus of state power, but by smashing it to pieces, levelling it with the ground (in spite of the howls of frightened philistines and the threats of saboteurs) and building a new state apparatus. 
 That new state apparatus is adapted to the dictatorship of the proletariat and to its strug-gle against the bourgeoisie to win the non-proletarian working people. 
 That new apparatus is not anybody’s invention, itgrows out of the proletarian class struggle as that struggle becomes more widespread and intense. 
 That new apparatus of state power, the new type of state power, is Soviet power . 
 The Russian proletariat, immediately, a few hours after winning state power, proclaimed the dissolution of the oldstate apparatus (which, as Marx showed, had been for centu-ries adapted to serve the class interests of the bourgeoisie, even in the most democratic republic 79) and transferred all power to the Soviets ; and only the working and exploited people could enter the Soviets, all exploiters of every kindwere excluded. 
 In that way the proletariat at once, at one stroke, imme-diately after it had taken state power, won from the bour-geoisie the vast mass of its supporters in the petty-bourgeois and “socialist” parties; for that mass, the working and ex-ploited people who had been deceived by the bourgeoisie (andby its yes-men, the Chernovs, Kautskys, Martovs and Co. 
),on obtaining Soviet power , acquired, for the first time , an instrument of mass struggle for their interests against the bourgeoisie. 
 Secondly, the proletariat can, and must, at once, or at all events very quickly, win from the bourgeoisie and frompetty-bourgeois democrats “ their ” masses , i. 
e. 
, the masses which follow them—win them by satisfying their most urgent economic needs in a revolutionary way by expropriating the landowners and the bourgeoisie . 
 The bourgeoisie cannot do that, no matter how “mighty” its state power may be. 
 The proletariat can do that on the very next day after it has won state power, because for this it has both an apparatus (the Soviets) and economic means (the expropria-tion of the landowners and the bourgeoisie). 
 That is exactly how the Russian proletariat won the peas-antry from the Socialist-Revolutionaries, and won them literally a few hours after achieving state power; a few hours after the victory over the bourgeoisie in Petrograd, the victorious proletariat issued a “decree on land”,80 and in that decree it entirely, at once, with revolutionary swift-ness, energy and devotion, satisfied all the most urgent eco-nomic needs of the majority of the peasants, it expropriated the landowners, entirely and without compensation. 
 To prove to the peasants that the proletarians did not want to steam-roller them, did not want to boss them, but to help them and be their friends, the victorious Bolsheviksdid not put a single word of their own into that “decree on land”, but copied it, word for word, from the peasantmandates (the most revolutionary of them, of course) whichthe Socialist-Revolutionaries had published in the Socialist-Revolutionary newspaper. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries fumed and raved, protested and howled that “the Bolsheviks had stolen their programme”,but they were only laughed at for that; a fine party,indeed, which had to be defeated and driven from the govern-ment in order that everything in its programme that was revolutionary and of benefit to the working people could be carried out! The traitors, blockheads and pedants of the Second International could never understand such dialectics; theproletariat cannot achieve victory if it does not win the ma-jority of the population to its side. 
 But to limit that winning to polling a majority of votes in an election under the rule of the bourgeoisie , or to make it the condition for it, is crass stupidity, or else sheer deception of the workers. 
 In order towin the majority of the population to its side the proletariatmust, in the first place, overthrow the bourgeoisie and seizestate power; secondly, it must introduce Soviet power and completely smash the old state apparatus, whereby it imme-diately undermines the rule, prestige and influence of thebourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois compromisers over the non-proletarian working people. 
 Thirdly, it must entirely destroy the influence of the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois compromisers over the majority of the non-proletarian masses by satisfying their economic needs in a revolutionary way at the expense of the exploiters . 
 It is possible to do this, of course, only when capitalist development has reached a certain level. 
 Failing that fun-damental condition, the proletariat cannot develop into a separate class, nor can success be achieved in its prolonged training, education, instruction and trial in battle duringlong years of strikes and demonstrations when the oppor-tunists are disgraced and expelled. 
 Failing that fundamentalcondition, the centres will not play that economic and po-litical role which enables the proletariat, after their capture, to lay hold of state power in its entirety, or more correctly, of its vital nerve, its core, its node. 
 Failing that fundamentalcondition, there cannot be the kinship, closeness and bondbetween the position of the proletariat and that of the non-proletarian working people which (kinship, closeness andbond) are necessary for the proletariat to influence those masses, for its influence over them to be effective. 
 V Let us proceed further. 
 The proletariat can win state power, establish the Soviet system, and satisfy the economic needs of the majority of the working people at the expense of the exploiters. 
 Is that sufficient for achieving complete and final victory? No, it is not. 
 The petty-bourgeois democrats, their chief present-day representatives, the “socialists” and “Social-Democrats”,are suffering from illusions when they imagine that the working people are capable, under capitalism, of acquiring the high degree of class-consciousness, firmness of character,perception and wide political outlook that will enable themto decide, merely by voting , or at all events, to decide in advance , without long experience of struggle, that they will follow a particular class, or a particular party. 
 It is a mere illusion. 
 It is a sentimental story invented by pedants and sentimental socialists of the Kautsky, Longuetand MacDonald type. 
 Capitalism would not be capitalism if it did not, on the one hand, condemn the masses to a downtrodden, crushed and terrified state of existence, to disunity (the country-side!) and ignorance, and if it (capitalism) did not, on theother hand, place in the hands of the bourgeoisie a giganticapparatus of falsehood and deception to hoodwink the massesof workers and peasants, to stultify their minds, and soforth. 
 That is why only the proletariat can lead the working people out of capitalism to communism. 
 It is no use think-ing that the petty-bourgeois or semi-petty-bourgeois massescan decide in advance the extremely complicated politicalquestion: “to be with the working class or with the bour-geoisie”. 
 The vacillation of the non-proletarian sections of the working people is inevitable; and inevitable also is their own practical experience , which will enable them to compare leadership by the bourgeoisie with leadership by the proletariat. 
 This is the circumstance that is constantly lost sight of by those who worship “consistent democracy” and who imagine that extremely important political problems can be solved by voting. 
 Such problems are actually solved by civil war if they are acute and aggravated by struggle, and theexperience of the non-proletarian masses (primarily of the peasants), their experience of comparing the rule of theproletariat with the rule of the bourgeoisie, is of tremendous importance in that war. 
 The Constituent Assembly elections in Russia in Novem-ber 1917, compared with the two-year Civil War of 1917-19,are highly instructive in this respect. 
 See which districts proved to be the least Bolshevik. 
 First, the East-Urals and the Siberian where the Bolshe-viks polled 12 per cent and 10 per cent of the votes respec-tively. 
 Secondly, the Ukraine where the Bolsheviks polled10 per cent of the votes. 
 Of the other districts, the Bolshe-viks polled the smallest percentage of votes in the peasantdistrict of Great Russia, the Volga-Black Earth district,but even there the Bolsheviks polled 16 per cent of the votes. 
 It was precisely in the districts where the Bolsheviks polled the lowest percentage of votes in November 1917 thatthe counter-revolutionary movements, the revolts and the organisation of counter-revolutionary forces had the great-est success. 
 It was precisely in those districts that the rule of Kolchak and Denikin lasted for months and months. 
 The vacillation of the petty-bourgeois population was particularly marked in those districts where the influenceof the proletariat is weakest. 
 Vacillation was at first infavour of the Bolsheviks when they granted land and whenthe demobilised soldiers brought the news about peace; later—against the Bolsheviks when, to promote the inter-national development of the revolution and to protect itscentre in Russia, they agreed to sign the Treaty of Brest andthereby “offended” patriotic sentiments, the deepest of petty-bourgeois sentiments. 
 The dictatorship of the proletariatwas particularly displeasing to the peasants in those places where there were the largest stocks of surplus grain, when the Bolsheviks showed that they would strictly and firmlysecure the transfer of those surplus stocks to the state at fixedprices. 
 The peasants in the Urals, Siberia and the Ukraineturned to Kolchak and Denikin. 
 Further, the experience of Kolchak and Denikin “democ-racy”, about which every hack writer in Kolchakia and Deni-kia shouted in every issue of the whiteguard newspapers,showed the peasants that phrases about democracy and aboutthe “Constituent Assembly” serve only as a screen to concealthe dictatorship of the landowners and capitalists. 
 Another turn towards Bolshevism began and peasant revolts spread in the rear of Kolchak and Denikin. 
 The peasants welcomed the Red troops as liberators. 
 In the long run, it was this vacillation of the peasantry, the main body of the petty-bourgeois working people, thatdecided the fate of Soviet rule and of the rule of Kolchakand Denikin. 
 But this “long run” was preceded by a fairly lengthy period of severe struggle and painful trial, which have not ended in Russia after two years, have not endedprecisely in Siberia and in the Ukraine. 
 And there is noguarantee that they will end completely within, say, another year or so. 
 The supporters of “consistent” democracy have not given thought to the importance of this historic fact. 
 They invent-ed, and are still inventing, nursery tales about the prole-tariat under capitalism being able to “convince” the majority of the working people and win them firmly to its side by vot-ing. 
 But reality shows that only in the course of a long and fierce struggle does the stern experience of the vacillating petty bourgeoisie lead it to the conclusion, after comparing the dictatorship of the proletariat with thedictatorship of the capitalists, that the former is betterthan the latter. 
 In theory, all socialists who have studied Marxism and are willing to take into account the lessons of the nineteenth-century political history of the advanced countries recognisethat the vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie between the proletariat and the capitalist class is inevitable. 
 The eco-nomic roots of this vacillation are clearly revealed by econom-ic science, the truths of which have been repeated millions of times in the newspapers, leaflets and pamphlets issued by the socialists of the Second International. 
 But these people cannot apply those truths to the peculiar epoch of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 They substitutepetty-bourgeois-democratic prejudices and illusions (aboutclass “equality”, about “consistent” or “pure’ democracy, about solving great historic problems by voting, and so forth) for the class struggle. 
 They will not understand thatafter capturing state power the proletariat does not therebycease its class struggle , but continues it in a different form and by different means. 
 The dictatorship of the proletariat isthe class struggle of the proletariat conducted with the aid of an instrument like state power, a class struggle, one of whose aims is to demonstrate to the non-proletarian sectionsof the working people by means of their long experience anda long list of practical examples that it is more to theiradvantage to side with the dictatorship of the proletariat thanwith the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and that there can be no third course. 
 The returns of the Constituent Assembly elections held in November 1917 give us the main background to the pictureof the development of the Civil War that has raged for twoyears since those elections. 
 The main forces in that warwere already clearly evident during the Constituent Assembly elections—the role of the “striking force” of the proletarian army, the role of the vacillating peasantry, and the role ofthe bourgeoisie were already apparent. 
 In his article N . 
V. 
 Svyatitsky writes: “The Cadets were most successful in the same regions where the Bolsheviks were most successful—in the Northern and Central-Industrial regions” (p. 
 116). 
 Natural-ly, in the most highly developed capitalist centres, the inter-mediary elements standing between the proletariat and thebourgeoisie were the weakest. 
 Naturally, in those centres,the class struggle was most acute. 
 It was there that the mainforces of the bourgeoisie were concentrated and there, only there, could the proletariat defeat the bourgeoisie. 
 Only the proletariat could rout the bourgeoisie, and only after rout-ing the bourgeoisie could the proletariat definitely win thesympathy and support of the petty-bourgeois strata of thepopulation by using an instrument like state power. 
 If properly used, if correctly read, the returns of the Constituent Assembly elections reveal to us again and again the fundamental truths of the Marxist doctrine of the classstruggle. 
 These returns, incidentally, also reveal the role and impor-tance of the national question. 
 Take the Ukraine. 
 At thelast conferences on the Ukrainian question some comrades accused the writer of these lines of giving too much “promi-nence” to the national question in the Ukraine. 
 The returnsof the Constituent Assembly elections show that in theUkraine, as early as November 1917, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionaries and socialists polled a majority (3. 
4 millionvotes & 0. 
5 = 3. 
9 million against 1. 
9 million polled by the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries, out of a total poll in the whole of the Ukraine of 7. 
6 million votes). 
 In the armyon the South-Western and Rumanian fronts the Ukrainian socialists polled 30 per cent and 34 per cent of the total votes(the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries polled 40 per centand 59 per cent). 
 Under these circumstances, to ignore the importance of the national question in the Ukraine—a sin of which GreatRussians are often guilty (and of which the Jews are guiltyperhaps only a little less often than the Great Russians)—is a great and dangerous mistake. 
 The division between theRussian and Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionaries as early as 1917 could not have been accidental. 
 As internationalists it is our duty, first, to combat very vigorously the survivals(sometimes unconscious) of Great-Russian imperialism and chauvinism among “Russian” Communists; and secondly, it is our duty, precisely on the national question, which is a relatively minor one (for an internationalist the question of state frontiers is a secondary, if not a tenth-rate, question),to make concessions. 
 There are other questions—the funda-mental interests of the proletarian dictatorship; the interestsof the unity and discipline of the Red Army which is fightingDenikin; the leading role of the proletariat in relation to the peasantry—that are more important; the question whether the Ukraine will be a separate state is far less important. 
 Wemust not be in the least surprised, or frightened, even by theprospect of the Ukrainian workers and peasants trying outdifferent systems, and in the course of, say, several years,testing by practice union with the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, or seceding from the latter and forming an independent Ukrainian S. 
S. 
R. 
, or various forms of their close alliance, and so on, and soforth. 
 To attempt to settle this question in advance, once and for all, “firmly” and “irrevocably”, would be narrow-mindednessor sheer stupidity, for the vacillation of the non-proletarian working people on such a question is quite natural, even inevitable, but not in the least frightful for the proletariat. 
 Itis the duty of the proletarian who is really capable of beingan internationalist to treat such vacillation with the greatest caution and tolerance, it is his duty to leave it to the non-proletarian masses themselves to get rid of this vacillation as a result of their own experience. 
 We must be intolerant and ruthless, uncompromising and inflexible on other, morefundamental questions, some of which I have alreadypointed to above. 
 VI The comparison of the Constituent Assembly elections in November 1917 with the development of the proletarianrevolution in Russia from October 1917 to December 1919enables us to draw conclusions concerning bourgeois parlia-mentarism and the proletarian revolution in every capital-ist country. 
 Let me try briefly to formulate, or at least to outline, the principal conclusions. 
 1. 
 Universal suffrage is an index of the level reached by the various classes in their understanding of their problems. 
 It shows how the various classes are inclined to solve their problems. 
 The actual solution of those problems is not provided by voting, but by the class struggle in all its forms including civil war. 
 2. 
 The socialists and Social-Democrats of the Second International take the stand of vulgar petty-bourgeoisdemocrats and share the prejudice that the fundamentalproblems of the class struggle can be solved by voting. 
 3. 
 The party of the revolutionary proletariat must take part in bourgeois parliaments in order to enlighten themasses; this can be done during elections and in the strugglebetween parties in parliament. 
 But limiting the classstruggle to the parliamentary struggle, or regarding thelatter as the highest and decisive form, to which all the other forms of struggle are subordinate, is actually desertion to the side of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat. 
 4. 
 All the representatives and supporters of the Second International, and all the leaders of the German, so-called“independent”, Social-Democratic Party, actually go over tothe bourgeoisie in this way when they recognise the dicta-torship of the proletariat in words, but in deeds, by their propaganda, imbue the proletariat with the idea that itmust first obtain a formal expression of the will of themajority of the population under capitalism (i. 
e. 
, a majorityof votes in the bourgeois parliament) to transfer politicalpower to the proletariat, which transfer is to take place later. 
 All the cries, based on this premise, of the German “inde-pendent” Social-Democrats and similar leaders of decayedsocialism against the “dictatorship of a minority”, and soforth, merely indicate that those leaders fail to understandthe dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, which actually reigns even in the most democratic republics, and that they fail to understand the conditions for its destruction by the classstruggle of the proletariat. 
 5. 
 This failure to understand consists, in particular, in the following: they forget that, to a very large degree,the bourgeois parties are able to rule because they deceive the masses of the people, because of the yoke of capital, and to this is added self-deception concerning the nature ofcapitalism, a self-deception which is characteristic mostly of the petty-bourgeois parties, which usually want to sub-stitute more or less disguised forms of class conciliation for the class struggle. 
 “First let the majority of the population, while private property still exists, i. 
e. 
, while the rule and yoke of capitalstill exist, express themselves in favour of the party of theproletariat and only then can and should the party takepower”—so say the petty-bourgeois democrats who call themselves socialists but who are in reality the servitors of the bourgeoisie. 
 “Let the revolutionary proletariat first overthrow the bourgeoisie, break the yoke of capital, and smash the bour-geois state apparatus, then the victorious proletariat willbe able rapidly to gain the sympathy and support of the majority of the non-proletarian working people by satisfying their needs at the expense of the exploiters”—say we. 
 Theopposite will be rare exception in history (and even in suchan exception the bourgeoisie can resort to civil war, as theexample of Finland showed 81). 
 6. 
 Or in other words: “First we shall pledge ourselves to recognise the prin-ciple of equality, or consistent democracy, while preservingprivate property and the yoke of capital (i. 
e. 
, actual inequali-ty under formal equality), and try to obtain the decisionof the majority on this basis”—say the bourgeoisie andtheir yes-men, the petty-bourgeois democrats who call themselves socialists and Social-Democrats. 
 “First the proletarian class struggle, winning state power, will destroy the pillars and foundations of actual inequality,and then the proletariat, which has defeated the exploiters,will lead all working people to the abolition of classes , i. 
e. 
, to socialist equality , the only kind that is not a deception”— say we. 
 7. 
 In all capitalist countries, besides the proletariat, or that part of the proletariat which is conscious of its revo-lutionary aims and is capable of fighting to achieve them,there are numerous politically immature proletarian, semi-proletarian, semi-petty-bourgeois strata which follow the bourgeoisie and bourgeois democracy (including the “socialists” of the Second International) because they havebeen deceived, have no confidence in their own strength, or in the strength of the proletariat, are unaware of the possi-bility of having their urgent needs satisfied by means of the expropriation of the exploiters. 
 These strata of the working and exploited people provide the vanguard of the proletariat with allies and give it astable majority of the population; but the proletariat canwin these allies only with the aid of an instrument likestate power, that is to say, only after it has overthrown the bourgeoisie and has destroyed the bourgeois state apparatus. 
 8. 
 The strength of the proletariat in any capitalist country is far greater than the proportion it represents of the totalpopulation. 
 That is because the proletariat economicallydominates the centre and nerve of the entire economic system of capitalism, and also because the proletariat ex-presses economically and politically the real interests of theoverwhelming majority of the working people under capi-talism. 
 Therefore, the proletariat, even when it constitutes a minority of the population (or when the class-conscious and really revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat constitutes a minority of the population), is capable of overthrowingthe bourgeoisie and, after that, of winning to its side numer-ous allies from a mass of semi-proletarians and petty bour-geoisie who never declare in advance in favour of the rule ofthe proletariat, who do not understand the conditions and aims of that rule, and only by their subsequent experience become convinced that the proletarian dictatorship isinevitable, proper and legitimate. 
 9. 
 Finally, in every capitalist country there are always very broad strata of the petty bourgeoisie which inevitablyvacillate between capital and labour. 
 To achieve victory, the proletariat must, first, choose the right moment for its decisive assault on the bourgeoisie, taking into account,among other things, the disunity between the bourgeoisieand its petty-bourgeois allies, or the instability of theiralliance, and so forth. 
 Secondly, the proletariat must, afterits victory, utilise this vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie in such a way as to neutralise them, prevent their siding with the exploiters; it must be able to hold on for some timein spite of this vacillation , and so on, and so forth. 
 10. 
 One of the necessary conditions for preparing the proletariat for its victory is a long, stubborn and ruthless struggle against opportunism, reformism, social-chauvinism, and similar bourgeois influences and trends, which areinevitable, since the proletariat is operating in a capitalistenvironment. 
 If there is no such struggle, if opportunismin the working-class movement is not utterly defeatedbeforehand, there can be no dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 Bolshevism would not have defeated the bourgeoisie in 1917-19 if before that, in 1903-17, it had not learned to de-feat the Mensheviks, i. 
e. 
, the opportunists, reformists, social-chauvinists, and ruthlessly expel them from the party ofthe proletarian vanguard. 
 At the present time, the verbal recognition of the dic-tatorship of the proletariat by the leaders of the German “Independents”, or by the French Longuetists, 82 and the like, who are actually continuing the old, habitual policy of big and small concessions to and conciliation with opportun-ism, subservience to the prejudices of bourgeois democracy(“consistent democracy” or “pure democracy” as they call it) and bourgeois parliamentarism, and so forth, is the most dangerous self-deception—and sometimes sheer fooling ofthe workers.

 Ulyanov (Lenin ) Smena No. 
 1, Published according to December 18, 1919 the Smena text SPEECH AT A MEETING IN PRESNYA DISTRICT ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE DECEMBER UPRISING, 1905 DECEMBER 19, 1919 Comrades, we are gathered here today to celebrate the anniversary of the December uprising in Moscow and thebattle that took place in Presnya District fourteen years ago. 
 Comrades, the 1905 insurrection in Moscow was one of the greatest movements by Russian worker revolutionaries and although it could not have been a success at that time it was nevertheless of tremendous significance. 
 It is only today,when we have before us a picture of the many years ofhistorical preparatory work for the Russian revolution, thatwe can properly appreciate the significance of the Decemberuprising in 1905 and of the battles that the workers of Red Presnya then fought against the forces of tsarism. 
 Comrades, we now see clearly how insignificant the forces of the Russianworkers then were; and we see that the sacrifices made atthat time have been repaid a hundredfold. 
 I must say, however, that in December 1905, tsarism had to muster all its forces in order to suppress the still weak, embryonic revolt of the workers. 
 The Moscow organisation of our Party has recently published two collections ofreminiscences of the December insurrection, the events inPresnya, and about the way the weak underground Partyorganisation of that time prepared the insurrection and aboutthe tremendous enthusiasm with which not only factory workers, but all the working people of Moscow supported it. 
 Among these newly published articles there is a parti-cularly interesting one by a gendarme and police officer which admits that the revolutionaries in December 1905 still did not know how weak they, the supporters of tsarism, were at that time. 
 “If the blow struck by the revolutionaries had been a little more powerful and had lasted a littlelonger,” admits this servant of the tsar, “we should not havebeen able to hold out, with the disorder that was beginningto make itself felt among us. 
” This admission, made by amember of the secret police, is especially interesting; it shows that the sacrifices made by the workers of Presnya in the cause of freedom and the emancipation of the workerswere not made in vain, that even then their heroic exampledemonstrated the strength of the working class to all enemiesand at the same time ignited those millions of sparks thatlater, in a long and toilsome manner, over a period of many years, burst into flame and produced the victorious revolution. 
 After 1905 the working-class movement in Russia expe-rienced the most difficult and bloody period of its history. 
Tsarism showed unprecedented brutality in dealing withthe heroes who revolted in Moscow in 1905. 
 After the sup-pression of the Moscow uprising the working class of Russia made several more attempts to rise to the level of a mass struggle. 
 In the spring of 1906 there were mass strikes andthe beginnings of a peasant movement; in 1907 anotherattempt was made—these attempts, however, could onlyslow down the forces of reaction but were unable to checkthem. 
 And long years passed during which the movement was forced to hide in the underground, when hundreds and thousands of the sons of the working class perished on thegallows, in prisons, in exile and in penal colonies. 
 Then we saw that in 1910, 1911 and 1912 the working class again began to muster its forces and we saw how, afterthe Lena massacre in April 1912, a wave of powerful mass strikes began to rise which spread from one end of the country to the other and gave tsarism such a jolt that by the summerof 1914 events went as far as barricades in Petrograd; it ispossible that one of the reasons accelerating the tsaristgovernment’s desperate decision to start the war was theirhope of crushing the revolutionary movement in that way. 
 Instead of crushing it, however, the war was the cause of the revolutionary movement spreading to all advanced coun-tries. 
 As we can see clearly enough, the four-year war was carried on by predators, not only by German but also by British and French imperialism, for the purpose of plunder. 
 When the Germans, in 1918, imposed the plundering Treatyof Brest-Litovsk upon us, there was no end to the shoutsdisapproving of that treaty in France and Britain, and whena year later, in that same year of 1918, Germany was defeatedand the German Empire collapsed, the French and British capitalists then imposed the Treaty of Versailles on conquered Germany; this is now an example of measuresstill more brutal, more violent, than we had at Brest-Litovsk. 
 We now see how, week by week, the eyes of hundreds, thousands and millions of workers in France, Britain and America are being opened; they were duped and were assured that the~ were fighting a war against German imperialismand they have now seen that millions of people were killedand maimed in that war. 
 And for what? For the enrichmentof an insignificant handful of millionaires who since the warhave become multimillionaires and who have brought all countries to the brink of ruin. 
 Comrades, we are living in difficult times insofar as con-cerns the misfortunes that have overtaken the industrial,especially the urban, workers. 
 You know how difficult thissituation is and how hungry and cold our working class is. 
And we also know that not only backward Russia who was torn by war for four years and after that has had for another two years to pursue a war imposed on her with the help ofBritain and France—Russia was not the only country thathas been ruined, but the most advanced and wealthy coun-tries, the victor countries such as, for instance, France andthe U. 
S. 
A. 
, have also been brought to the brink of ruin. 
 They are experiencing a coal crisis, they have to curtail the railway services because their industry and transport werecrushed and ruined to an unparalleled degree by four yearsof war. 
 Huge productive forces were destroyed inthat imperialist war and we see as a result that the roadwhich the Russian working class showed all workers, showed the whole world as far back as 1905 when it revolted against tsarism, the path which was followed by the Russianworking class when it overthrew the bourgeoisie—that path is now attracting the attention and winning the sympathy of workers of all, even the most advanced, countries. 
 I have already said, comrades, that this winter we have to endure unparalleled hardships and calamities. 
 Wesay to ourselves, however, that we shall stand firm to theend, because the best of the workers, the most politically-conscious workers and peasants, have, despite all calamitiesand hardships, been helping us, helping us by forming the Red Army which is bringing us to final victory. 
 We know that now that Kolchak’s forces have been completely routedand the recent revolts in Siberia have seemingly deprivedthe remnants of Kolchak’s army of the possibility of joiningup with Denikin, and now that huge military forces havebeen captured at Novo-Nikolayevsk, there is obviously no longer Kolchak’s army. 
 In the South, where Denikin was able to boast of his successes, we now see the steadily grow-ing offensive of our Red Army. 
 You know that Kiev,Poltava and Kharkov have been captured and our advanceon the Donets Basin, the source of coal supplies, is proceed-ing at an extremely rapid rate. 
 We therefore see, comrades, that all those terrible mis-fortunes which the working class has borne for the sake ofour full victory over capital, all the sacrifices that havebeen made are now bringing good results. 
 We see that capi-talists abroad who have, until now, been handing outmillions of rubles and every kind of war materiel, first to Kolchak, and then to Yudenich and Denikin, are now begin-ning to hesitate. 
 You know that they cut Russia off from other countries by the iron ring of the blockade and you know that theydid not let our representatives go to other countries. 
 Youknow that Comrade Litvinov, one of the revolutionaries who fought with the Bolsheviks against tsarism even before 1905, was our Ambassador to Great Britain and that therewas not a workers’ meeting that did not greet him withsuch applause and with such stormy protests against theirown government, that the British went to the trouble ofdeporting him. 
 Today, those people who hate Litvinov so heartily have given him permission to go to Copenhagen, and not merely permission, but also the means (Comrade Litvi-nov arrived there on a British cruiser). 
 We also know that every day of Comrade Litvinov’s stay in Copenhagen is an ever greater victory for Russia. 
 Workers’ representatives and the correspondents of thousands of bourgeois newspapers are constantly approaching him for an explanation of the changethat has taken place. 
 We know that the change has comebecause the Western bourgeoisie can no longer keep up theblockade and help the Russian counter-revolutionary gener-als with millions of rubles because the working class of each of those rich and advanced countries will not let them. 
 Perhaps the most vivid expression of the turn that has come in the politics of the European countries is the votingof the deputies in the Italian chamber which we know offrom the report sent by wireless from France to Americaand picked up by our wireless station. 
 The report was this. 
 When the question of Russia was discussed in the Italian chamber, and when the socialists proposed the immediaterecognition of the Soviet Republic, a hundred voted for andtwo hundred against the proposal; that means that only theworkers were in favour of recognising the Soviet Republicand all the bourgeois deputies rejected it. 
 After that, how-ever, the Italian chamber passed a unanimous motion to the effect that the Italian Government approach the allies witha view to stop the blockade altogether and put an end toall intervention in Russian affairs. 
 That was a decisionadopted by a chamber that consists to the extent of two-thirds, if not three-quarters, of landowners and capitalists, that was adopted in one of the victor countries and that was adopted simply under pressure from the working-classmovement. 
 The decision shows clearly that a real turning point in international politics is approaching and that the tremendousinner forces of the working-class movement of every country have actually brought about what we have always hoped for, which we told the workers of Russia would happen,and for the sake of which, we told them, it was worth whilestruggling and making heavy sacrifices, that the sacrificeswould have to be made, so that the troubles and torments,the hunger and cold that we are suffering from will not have been in vain. 
 In this way we are not merely saving Russia, we are winning the sympathy and support of millions andmillions of workers of other countries with every week of struggle. 
 That is why today, when we remember our com-rades who fell, the heroes of Red Presnya, the memory of them gives us greater enthusiasm and firm resolution to bring victory near. 
 Despite all difficulties and all sacrifices we shall go forward ourselves and will lead the workers of all countriesto full victory over capital.

) Brief report published December 20, 1919 in Izvestia No. 
 286 First published in full Published according to in the Fourth (Russian) the verbatim report Edition of the Collected Works REPOR T ON SUBBOTNIKS DELIVERE D TO A MOSCO W CITY CONFERENCE OF THE R. 
C. 
P. 
 (B. 
)84 DECEMBER 20, 1919 Comrades, the organisers of the conference inform me that you have arranged for a report on subbotniks and divided it into two parts so that it would be possible to discuss themain thing in this field in detail; first, the organisation ofsubbotniks in Moscow and results achieved, and secondly, practical conclusions for their further organisation. 
 I should like to confine myself to general propositions, to the ideasborn of the organisation of subbotniks as a new phenomenonin our Party and governmental development. 
 I shall, there-fore, dwell only briefly on the practical aspect. 
 When the first communist subbotniks had just been organised it was difficult to judge to what extent such a phe-nomenon deserved attention and whether anything big wouldcome of it. 
 I remember that when the first news of thembegan to appear in the Party press, the appraisals of com-rades close to trade union organisational affairs and theCommissariat of Labour were at first extremely restrained, if not pessimistic. 
 They did not think there were any grounds for regarding them as important. 
 Since then subbotnikshave become so widespread that their importance to ourdevelopment cannot be disputed by anyone. 
 We have actually been using the adjective “communist” very frequently, so frequently that we have even included it in the name of our Party. 
 But when you give this matter some thought, you arrive at the idea that together with thegood that has followed from this, a certain danger for us may have been created. 
 Our chief reason for changing the name of the Party was the desire to draw a clear line of distinction between us and the dominant socialism of the Second International. 
 After the overwhelming majority ofthe official socialist parties, through their leaders, had goneover to the side of the bourgeoisie of their own countries orof their own governments during the imperialist war, thetremendous crisis, the collapse of the old socialism, became obvious to us. 
 And in order to stress as sharply as possible that we could not consider socialists those whotook sides with their governments during the imperialistwar, in order to show that the old socialism had gone rotten,had died—mainly for that reason the idea of changing theParty’s name was put forward. 
 This the more so, since the name of “Social-Democratic” has from the theoretical point of view long ceased to be correct. 
 As far back as the forties,when it was first widely used politically in France, it wasapplied to a party professing petty-bourgeois socialistreformism and not to a party of the revolutionary prole-tariat. 
 The main reason, the motive for changing the name of our Party which has given its new name to the new Inter-national was the desire to cut ourselves off decisively fromthe old socialism. 
 If we were to ask ourselves in what way communism differs from socialism, we should have to say that socialismis the society that grows directly out of capitalism, it is the first form of the new society. 
 Communism is a higher form of society, and can only develop when socialism hasbecome firmly established. 
 Socialism implies work withoutthe aid of the capitalists, socialised labour with strict account-ing, control and supervision by the organised vanguard, theadvanced section of the working people; the measure of labour and remuneration for it must be fixed. 
 It is necessary to fix them because capitalist society has left behind suchsurvivals and such habits as the fragmentation of labour,no confidence in social economy, and the old habits of thepetty proprietor that dominate in all peasant countries. 
All this is contrary to real communist economy. 
 We give the name of communism to the system under which people form the habit of performing their social duties without anyspecial apparatus for coercion, and when unpaid work for the public good becomes a general phenomenon. 
 It stands to reason that the concept of “communism” is a far too distant one for those who are taking the first steps towards complete victory over capitalism. 
 No matter how correct it may havebeen to change the name of the Party, no matter how greatthe benefit the change has brought us, no matter how greatthe accomplishments of our cause and the scale on which it hasdeveloped—Communist Parties now exist throughout the world and although less than a year has passed since the foundation of the Communist International, 85 from the point of view of the labour movement it is incomparably strongerthan the old, dying Second International—if the name“Communist Party” were interpreted to mean that thecommunist system is being introduced immediately, that would be a great distortion and would do practical harm since it would be nothing more than empty boasting. 
 That is why the word “communist” must be treated with great caution, and that is why communist subbotniks thathave begun to enter into our life are of particular value,because it is only in this extremely tiny phenomenon that something communist has begun to make its appearance. 
 The expropriation of the landowners and capitalists enabledus to organise only the most primitive forms of socialism,and there is not yet anything communist in it. 
 If we take ourpresent-day economy we see that the germs of socialism in itare still very weak and that the old economic forms dominate overwhelmingly; these are expressed either as the domina-tion of petty proprietorship or as wild, uncontrolledprofiteering. 
 When our adversaries, the petty-bourgeois demo-crats, Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, assert intheir objections to us that we have smashed large-scalecapitalism but that the worst kind of profiteering, usury capitalism, persists in its place, we tell them that if they imagine that we can go straight from large-scale capital-ism to communism they are not revolutionaries but reform-ists and utopians. 
 Large-scale capitalism has been seriously undermined everywhere, even in those countries where no steps towards socialism have yet been taken. 
 From this point of view, none of the criticisms or the objections levelled againstus by our opponents are serious. 
 Obviously the beginnings of a new, petty, profiteering capitalism began to make their appearance after large-scale capitalism had been crushed. 
 We are living through a savage battle against the survivals of large-scale capitalism which grasps at every kind of petty speculation where it is difficult to counteract it and where it takes on the worst and most unorganised form of trading. 
 The struggle has become much fiercer under war condi-tions and has led to the most brutal forms of profiteering, especially in places where capitalism was organised on a larger scale, and it would be quite incorrect to imagine that the revolutionary transition could have any other form. 
 That is how matters stand in respect of our present-day economy. 
 If we were to ask ourselves what the present economic system of Soviet Russia is, we should have to say that it consists in laying the foundations of socialism in large-scale industry, in reorganising the old capitalist economy with the capitalists putting up a stubborn resistance in millions and millions of different ways. 
 The countries of Western Europe that have emerged from the war as badly off as we are—Austria, for instance—differ from us only in that the disintegration of capitalism and speculation are more pronounced there than in our country and that there are no germs of socialist organisation to offer resistance to capi-talism. 
 There is, however, not yet anything communist in our economic system. 
 The “communist ” begins when subbot-niks (i. 
e. 
, unpaid labour with no quota set by any authori-ty or any state) make their appearance; they constitute thelabour of individuals on an extensive scale for the publicgood. 
 This is not helping one’s neighbour in the way thathas always been customary in the countryside; it is workdone to meet the needs of the country as a whole, and it is organised on a broad scale and is unpaid. 
 It would, there-fore, be more correct if the word “communist” were appliednot only to the name of the Party but also to those economicmanifestations in our reality that are actually communistin character. 
 If there is anything communist at all in theprevailing system in Russia, it is only the subbotniks, and everything else is nothing but the struggle against capitalism for the consolidation of socialism out of which,after the full victory of socialism, there should grow that communism that we see at subbotniks, not with the aid of a book, but in living reality. 
 Such is the theoretical significance of subbotniks; they demonstrate that here something quite new is beginningto emerge in the form of unpaid labour, extensively organ-ised to meet the needs of the entire state, something that iscontrary to all the old capitalist rules, something thatis much more lofty than the socialist society that is con-quering capitalism. 
 When the workers on the Moscow-Ka-zan Railway, people who were living under conditions ofthe worst famine and the greatest need, first responded tothe appeal of the Central Committee of the Party to cometo the aid of the country, 86 and when there appeared signs that communist subbotniks were no longer a matter of single cases but were spreading and meeting with the sym-pathy of the masses, we were able to say that they were aphenomenon of tremendous theoretical importance and thatwe really should afford them all-round support if we wantedto be Communists in more than mere theory, in more thanthe struggle against capitalism. 
 From the point of view of the practical construction of a socialist society that is not enough. 
 It must be said that the movement can really bedeveloped on a mass scale. 
 I do not undertake to say whetherwe have proved this since no general summaries of the extentof the movement we call communist subbotniks have yetbeen prepared. 
 I have only fragmentary information and have read in the Party press that these subbotniks are devel-oping more and more widely in a number of towns. 
 Petro-grad comrades say that subbotniks are far more widespreadin their city than in Moscow. 
 As far as the provinces areconcerned many of the comrades who have a practical knowl-edge of this movement have told me that they are collect-ing a huge amount of material on this new form of social labour. 
 However, we shall only be able to obtain summariseddata after the question has been discussed many timesin the press and at Party conferences in different cities; onthe basis of those data we shall be able to say whether thesubbotniks have really become a mass phenomenon, and whether we have really achieved important successes in this sphere. 
 Whatever may be the case, whether or not we shall soon obtain that sort of complete and verified data, we should not doubt that from the theoretical point of view the subbot-niks are the only manifestation we have to show that we donot only call ourselves Communists, that we do not merelywant to be Communists, but are actually doing somethingthat is communist and not merely socialist. 
 Every Commu-nist, therefore, everyone who wants to be true to the prin-ciples of communism should devote all his attention and all his efforts to the explanation of this phenomenon andto its practical implementation. 
 That is the theoreticalsignificance of the subbotniks. 
 At every Party conference,therefore, we must persistently raise this question and dis-cuss both its theoretical and its practical aspect. 
 We must not limit this phenomenon to its theoretical significance. 
 Communist subbotniks are of tremendous importance to usnot only because they are the practical implementation ofcommunism. 
 Apart from this, subbotniks have a doublesignificance—from the standpoint of the state they arepurely practical aid to the state, and from the standpoint of the Party—and for us, members of the Party, this must not remain in the shade—they have the significance of purg-ing the Party of undesirable elements and are of impor-tance in the struggle against the influences experienced bythe Party at a time when capitalism is decaying. 
 Brief report published in Izvestia No. 
 287, December 21, 1919 First published in full in 1927 Published according to the verbatim report First page of Lenin’s manuscript “Letter to the Workers and Peasants of the Ukraine Apropos of the Victories over Denikin”. 
 December 28, 1919 Reduced First page of Lenin’s manuscript “Letter to the Workers and Peasants of the Ukraine Apropos of the Victories over Denikin”. 
 December 28, 1919 Reduced LETTER TO THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS OF THE UKRAINE APROPOS OF THE VICTORIES OVER DENIKIN Comrades, four months ago, towards the end of August 1919, I had occasion to address a letter to the workers andpeasants in connection with the victory over Kolchak. 
 I am now having this letter reprinted in full for the workers and peasants of the Ukraine in connection with thevictories over Denikin. 
 Red troops have taken Kiev, Poltava and Kharkov and are advancing victoriously on Rostov. 
 The Ukraine is seeth-ing with revolt against Denikin. 
 All forces must be ralliedfor the final rout of Denikin’s army, which has been tryingto restore the power of the landowners and capitalists. 
 Wemust destroy Denikin to safeguard ourselves against even the slightest possibility of a new incursion. 
 The workers and peasants of the Ukraine should familiar-ise themselves with the lessons which all Russian workersand peasants have drawn from the conquest of Siberia byKolchak and her liberation by Red troops after manymonths of landowner and capitalist tyranny. 
 Denikin’s rule in the Ukraine has been as severe an ordeal as Kolchak’s rule was in Siberia. 
 There can be nodoubt that the lessons of this severe ordeal will give theUkrainian workers and peasants—as they did the workersand peasants of the Urals and Siberia—a clearer understand-ing of the tasks of Soviet power and induce them to defend it more staunchly. 
 In Great Russia the system of landed estates has been completely abolished. 
 The same must be done in the Ukraine, and the Soviet power of the Ukrainian workers and peas-ants must effect the complete abolition of the landed es-tates and the complete liberation of the Ukrainian workers and peasants from all oppression by the landowners, andfrom the landowners themselves. 
 But apart from this task, and a number of others which confronted and still confront both the Great-Russian andthe Ukrainian working masses, Soviet power in the Ukraine has its own special tasks. 
 One of these special tasks deserves the greatest attention at the present moment. 
 It is the nation-al question, or, in other words, the question of whether theUkraine is to be a separate and independent UkrainianSoviet Socialist Republic bound in alliance (federation)with the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, or whether the Ukraine is to amalgamate with Russia to form a single Soviet republic. 
 All Bolsheviks and all politi-cally-conscious workers and peasants must give carefulthought to this question. 
 The independence of the Ukraine has been recognised both by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 (Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Repub-lic) and by the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). 
It is therefore self-evident and generally recognised thatonly the Ukrainian workers and peasants themselves can andwill decide at their All-Ukraine Congress of Soviets whetherthe Ukraine shall amalgamate with Russia, or whether she shall remain a separate and independent republic, and, in the latter case, what federal ties shall be established betweenthat republic and Russia. 
 How should this question be decided insofar as concerns the interests of the working people and the promotion oftheir fight for the complete emancipation of labour from the yoke of capital? In the first place, the interests of labour demand the fullest confidence and the closest alliance among the work-ing people of different countries and nations. 
 The support-ers of the landowners and capitalists, of the bourgeoisie,strive to disunite the workers, to intensify national discord and enmity, in order to weaken the workers and strengthen the power of capital. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR Capital is an international force. 
 To vanquish it, an international workers’ alliance, an international workers’ brotherhood, is needed. 
 We are opposed to national enmity and discord, to nation-al exclusiveness. 
 We are internationalists. 
 We stand forthe close union and the complete amalgamation of theworkers and peasants of all nations in a single world Sovietrepublic. 
 Secondly, the working people must not forget that capi-talism has divided nations into a small number of oppressor,Great-Power (imperialist), sovereign and privileged nationsand an overwhelming majority of oppressed, dependentand semi-dependent, non-sovereign nations. 
 The arch-crim-inal and arch-reactionary war of 1914-18 still further accentuated this division and as a result aggravated rancour and hatred. 
 For centuries the indignation and distrust ofthe non-sovereign and dependent nations towards the domi-nant and oppressor nations have been accumulating, ofnations such as the Ukrainian towards nations such as theGreat-Russian. 
 We want a voluntary union of nations—a union which precludes any coercion of one nation by another—a unionfounded on complete confidence, on a clear recognition ofbrotherly unity, on absolutely voluntary consent. 
 Such aunion cannot be effected at one stroke; we have to worktowards it with the greatest patience and circumspection, so as not to spoil matters and not to arouse distrust, and so that the distrust inherited from centuries of landowner andcapitalist oppression, centuries of private property and theenmity caused by its divisions and redivisions may havea chance to wear off. 
 We must, therefore, strive persistently for the unity of nations and ruthlessly suppress everything that tends to divide them, and in doing so we must be very cautious andpatient, and make concessions to the survivals of nationaldistrust. 
 We must be adamant and uncompromising towardseverything that affects the fundamental interests of labourin its fight for emancipation from the yoke of capital. 
 The question of the demarcation of frontiers now, for the time being—for we are striving towards the complete abolition offrontiers—is a minor one, it is not fundamental or important. 
 In this matter we can afford to wait, and must wait, because the national distrust among the broad mass of peas-ants and small owners is often extremely tenacious, and haste might only intensify it, in other words, jeopardisethe cause of complete and ultimate unity. 
 The experience of the workers’ and peasants’ revolution in Russia, the revolution of October-November 1917, and ofthe two years of victorious struggle against the onslaught of international and Russian capitalists, has made it crystal-clear that the capitalists have succeeded for a time in play-ing upon the national distrust of the Great Russians feltby Polish, Latvian, Estonian and Finnish peasants andsmall owners, that they have succeeded for a time insowing dissension between them and us on the basis of this distrust. 
 Experience has shown that this distrust wears off and disappears only very slowly, and that the more cautionand patience displayed by the Great Russians, who have forso long been an oppressor nation, the more certainly thisdistrust will pass. 
 It is by recognising the independence ofthe Polish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian and Finnish states that we are slowly but steadily winning the confidence of the labouring masses of the neighbouring small states,who were more backward and more deceived and downtrod-den by the capitalists. 
 It is the surest way of wresting themfrom the influence of “their” national capitalists, and lead-ing them to full confidence, to the future united inter-national Soviet republic. 
 As long as the Ukraine is not completely liberated from Denikin, her government, until the All-UkraineCongress of Soviets meets, is the All-Ukraine RevolutionaryCommittee. 
 87 Besides the Ukrainian Bolshevik Communists, there are Ukrainian Borotba Communists88 working on this Revolutionary Committee as members of the government. 
 One of the things distinguishing the Borotbists from theBolsheviks is that they insist upon the unconditional inde-pendence of the Ukraine. 
 The Bolsheviks will not makethis a subject of difference and disunity, they do not regard this as an obstacle to concerted proletarian effort. 
 There must be unity in the struggle against the yoke of capital and for the dictatorship of the proletariat, and there shouldbe no parting of the ways among Communists on the ques-tion of national frontiers, or whether there should be a federal or some other tie between the states. 
 Among the Bolsheviks there are advocates of complete independence for the Ukraine, advocates of a more or less close federal tie, and advocatesof the complete amalgamation of the Ukraine with Russia. 
 There must be no differences over these questions. 
 They will be decided by the All-Ukraine Congress of Soviets. 
 If a Great-Russian Communist insists upon the amalgama-tion of the Ukraine with Russia, Ukrainians might easily suspect him of advocating this policy not from the motiveof uniting the proletarians in the fight against capital, butbecause of the prejudices of the old Great-Russian national-ism, of imperialism. 
 Such mistrust is natural, and to acertain degree inevitable and legitimate, because the Great Russians, under the yoke of the landowners and capitalists, had for centuries imbibed the shameful and disgusting prej-udices of Great-Russian chauvinism. 
 If a Ukrainian Communist insists upon the unconditional state independence of the Ukraine, he lays himself opento the suspicion that he is supporting this policy not because of the temporary interests of the Ukrainian workers and peasants in their struggle against the yoke of capital, buton account of the petty-bourgeois national prejudices ofthe small owner. 
 Experience has provided hundreds ofinstances of the petty-bourgeois “socialists” of variouscountries—all the various Polish, Latvian and Lithuanian pseudo-socialists, Georgian Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolu-tionaries and the like—assuming the guise of supportersof the proletariat for the sole purpose of deceitfully pro-moting a policy of compromise with “their” national bourgeoi-sie against the revolutionary workers. 
 We saw this in thecase of Kerensky’s rule in Russia in the February-October period of 1917, and we have seen it and are seeing it in all other countries. 
 Mutual distrust between the Great-Russian and Ukraini-an Communists can, therefore, arise very easily. 
 How isthis distrust to be combated? How is it to be overcome andmutual confidence established? The best way to achieve this is by working together to uphold the dictatorship of the proletariat and Soviet powerin the fight against the landowners and capitalists of all countries and against their attempts to restore their domi-nation. 
 This common fight will clearly show in practice that whatever the decision in regard to state independence or frontiers may be, there must be a close military and eco-nomic alliance between the Great-Russian and Ukrainianworkers, for otherwise the capitalists of the “Entente”, inother words, the alliance of the richest capitalist countries—Britain, France, America, Japan and Italy—will crush and strangle us separately. 
 Our fight against Kolchak and Denikin, whom these capitalists supplied with money andarms, is a clear illustration of this danger. 
 He who undermines the unity and closest alliance between the Great-Russian and Ukrainian workers and peasantsis helping the Kolchaks, the Denikins, the capitalist bandits of all countries. 
 Consequently, we Great-Russian Communists must repress with the utmost severity the slightest manifestationin our midst of Great-Russian nationalism, for such mani-festations, which are a betrayal of communism in general,cause the gravest harm by dividing us from our Ukrainian comrades and thus playing into the hands of Denikin and his regime. 
 Consequently, we Great-Russian Communists must make concessions when there are differences with the UkrainianBolshevik Communists and Borotbists and these differencesconcern the state independence of the Ukraine, the forms of her alliance with Russia, and the national question in general. 
 But all of us, Great-Russian Communists, Ukraini-an Communists, and Communists of any other nation,must be unyielding and irreconcilable in the underlyingand fundamental questions which are the same for all na-tions, in questions of the proletarian struggle, of the prole-tarian dictatorship; we must not tolerate compromise with the bourgeoisie or any division of the forces which are pro-tecting us against Denikin. 
 Denikin must be vanquished and destroyed, and such incursions as his not allowed to recur. 
 That is to the fun-damental interest of both the Great-Russian and the Ukraini-an workers and peasants. 
 The fight will be a long and hard one, for the capitalists of the whole world are helpingDenikin and will help all other Denikins. 
 In this long and hard fight we Great-Russian and Ukraini-an workers must maintain the closest alliance, for separately we shall most definitely be unable to cope with the task. 
 Whatever the boundaries of the Ukraine and Russia may be,whatever may be the forms of their mutual state relation-ships, that is not so important; that is a matter in whichconcessions can and should be made, in which one thing,or another, or a third may be tried—the cause of the workers and peasants, of the victory over capitalism, will not perish because of that. 
 But if we fail to maintain the closest alliance, an alliance against Denikin, an alliance against the capitalists andkulaks of our countries and of all countries, the cause oflabour will most certainly perish for many years to come in the sense that the capitalists will be able to crush and strangle both the Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia. 
 And what the bourgeoisie of all countries, and all manner of petty-bourgeois parties—i. 
e. 
, “compromising” partieswhich permit alliance with the bourgeoisie against theworkers—try most of all to accomplish is to disunite the workers of different nationalities, to evoke distrust, and to disrupt a close international alliance and internationalbrotherhood of the workers. 
 Whenever the bourgeoisie suc-ceeds in this the cause of the workers is lost. 
 The Communistsof Russia and the Ukraine must therefore by patient, per-sistent, stubborn and concerted effort foil the nationalist machinations of the bourgeoisie and vanquish nationalist prejudices of every kind, and set the working people of theworld an example of a really solid alliance of the workersand peasants of different nations in the fight for Soviet pow-er, for the overthrow of the yoke of the landowners andcapitalists, and for a world federal Soviet republic.

e. 
, WHILE LISTENING TO SPEECHES AT MEETINGS89 We are spoiling the Russian language. 
 We are using foreign words unnecessarily. 
 And we use them incorrectly. 
 Why use the foreign word defekty when we have three Rus-sian synonyms— nedochoty , nedostatki , probely . 
 A man who has recently learned to read in general, and to read newspapers in particular, will, of course, if he readsthem diligently, willy-nilly absorb journalistic turnsof speech. 
 However, it is the language of the newspapers that is beginning to suffer. 
 If a man who has recently learned to read uses foreign words as a novelty, he is to be excused,but there is no excuse for a writer. 
 Is it not time for usto declare war on the unnecessary use of foreign words? I must admit that the unnecessary use of foreign words annoys me (because it makes it more difficult for us to exer-cise our influence over the masses) but some of the mis-takes made by those who write in the newspapers make mereally angry. 
 For instance—the word budirovat is used in the meaning of arouse, awaken, stir up. 
 It comes from theFrench word bouder which means to sulk, to pout, which is what budirovat should really mean. 
 This adoption of Nizhni-Novgorod French is the adoption of the worst from the worst representatives of the Russian landowning class, wholearned some French but who, first, did not master the lan-guage, and who, secondly, distorted the Russian language.

 We are now happily ending the Civil War. 
 The Soviet Republic is becoming stronger through its victories over theexploiters. 
 The Soviet Republic can and must, from now on,concentrate its forces on a more important task, one thatis nearer and dearer to us, to all working people—on abloodless war, a war for victory over hunger, cold and economic chaos. 
 In this bloodless war, women workers and peasants have an especially big role to play. 
 May the Women’s Congress in Petrograd Gubernia help found, consolidate and organise an army of working womenfor this bloodless war which should and will bring stillgreater victories to Soviet power. 
 With communist greetings, V. 
 Ulyanov (Lenin ) January 10, 1920 Petrogradskaya Pravda No. 
 11, Published according to January 16, 1920 the manuscript REMARKS ON AND ADDENDA TO DRAFTS FOR “RULES FOR THE WORKERS ’ AND PEASANTS ’ INSPECTION ” To Comrade Stalin. 
 Copies to Avanesov and Tomsky, and also to Kiselyov, Mem-ber of the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee On the basis of directive given by the Central Commit-tee 91 the three drafts should, in my opinion, be worked up into one. 
 I think you should add: (1) The “Department” of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection at the State Control Commission should be atemporary one for the purpose of involving the Workers’and Peasants’ Inspection in all departments of the State Control Commission, and should then disappear as a specialdepartment. 
 (2) Purpose: all working people, both men and particu-larly women , should serve in the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. 
 (3) For this draw up lists in the localities (in accordance with the Constitution), excluding clerks, etc. 
 —all others in turn to participate in the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. 
 (4) Participation to vary according to the degree of development of the participants—beginning with the roleof “listener”, or witness, or learner for the illiterate andcompletely undeveloped workers and peasants, and endingwith the granting of all right (or almost all) to the literate and developed who have been tested in some way or another. 
 (5) Pay special attention to (and make strictly precise rules for), and extend control by the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection over accounting for food, goods , warehouses, tools, materials, fuel, etc. 
, etc. 
 (in dining-rooms, etc. 
, especially). 
 Women , literally every woman , must be drawn into this work. 
 (6) So as not to get into a mess with the involvement of masses of participants they must be drawn into the workgradually, in turn, etc. 
 The ways in which they participatemust also be carefully planned (two or three at a time, rare-ly, in special cases, more, so that they will not waste the working time of the clerks). 
 (7) Detailed instructions must be compiled. 
 (8) Officials of the State Control Commission must (in accordance with a special instruction), first, invite repre-sentatives of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection to all their operations, and secondly, deliver lectures to non-party conferences of workers and peasants (popular lecturesaccording to a specially approved programme on the prin-ciples of the State Control Commission and its methods;perhaps the lectures could be replaced by the reading of apamphlet that we shall publish—that is, the State Control Commission, Stalin and Avanesov, will publish it with the special participation of the Party—and commenting onthat pamphlet). 
 (9)Gradually summon peasants from the localities (they must be non-party peasants) to participate in the StateControl Commission at the centre; begin with at least (if it is impossible to do more) one or two from each gubernia and then, depending on transport and other conditions,increase the number . 
 The same thing for non-party workers. 
 (10) Gradually introduce the verification of the partici-pation of working people in the State Control Commissionby the Party and the trade unions, i. 
e. 
, through these organisations verify whether everyone participates and what results come from the participation insofar as learning thebusiness of state administration is concerned. 
 Lenin January 24, 1920 First published in 1928 Published according to the manuscript SPEECH DELIVERED AT A NON-PARTY CONFERENCE OF WORKERS AND RED ARMY MEN OF PRESNYA DISTRICT, MOSCOW JANUARY 24, 1920 NEWSPAPER REPORT “In connection with the recent victories of the Red Army there has been a marked change in our international situa-tion, and we must seek new ways of solving our internation-al problems. 
 “As soon as the Soviet government was formed all the forces of international capital were hurled against it. 
 Theseforces are far stronger than those of the Soviet government,so that waverers might have doubted whether the Sovietgovernment could be victorious. 
 Yet it has been victorious. 
And it is worth reflecting on the reasons for the Soviet government’s victory in order to know what must be done to be victorious in the future. 
” Comrade Lenin shows how great has been the victory over the forces of capital and how complete the rout ofKolchak, which has compelled the Allies to remove theblockade and to abandon their plan to strangle Russia. 
 “This victory over a far stronger enemy has shown that the Bolsheviks were right, and not those who asserted thatin taking up arms against the world bourgeoisie we wereembarking on a hopeless cause. 
 Although the removal of theblockade has eased our position somewhat, the bourgeoisieof the West will probably attempt to fight us again. 
 Even though they have now removed the blockade, they are incit-ing the Polish whiteguards against us. 
 We must, therefore,be once more on our guard, prepare for new attacks, draw the lessons from the two years of struggle and employ the methods by which we have been victorious hitherto. 
 “The Mensheviks have often said that the proletarians of the West are not supporting us, are allowing us to bestrangled as they allowed Hungary to be strangled. 
 92 That would seem to be true. 
 But why did the Entente troops quitthe North and Odessa? Because the more deeply their sol-diers, who were themselves workers, penetrated into Soviet Russia, the more emphatically they refused to fight against us. 
 That means that one of the reasons for our victory wasthis: we can be fought only by a big force, but a big armycan be recruited only from among the workers and peasants,and the workers of the West do not want to fight us. 
 Wewere therefore victorious not because we were the stronger, but because the working folk of the Entente countries proved to be closer to us than to their own governments. 
 “The second reason for our victory was the failure of the ‘Campaign of the Fourteen States’. 
 93 This shows that the small states cannot unite to fight the Bolsheviks, becausethey are afraid that their own victory and the simultaneous victory of Denikin’s forces would mean the restoration of the Russian Empire which would again rob the littlenations of the right to live. 
 We are concluding peace withEstonia, which is already a virtual breach in the block-ade, even if the formal removal of the blockade is justa blind. 
 “The big powers of the Entente cannot unite to fight the Soviet government because they are too hostile to eachother. 
 Germany is harbouring thoughts of vengeance againstFrance for the predatory Peace of Versailles, France isinciting Poland against us, while Britain is allowing Esto-nia to make peace with us, as long as Estonia trades with her. 
 Japan, who has a stronger army than ours in Siberia, cannot fight us because she fears attack by America, withwhom she is at loggerheads over imperialist, colonialistinterests in China. 
 That means that a second reason for ourvictory was this: whereas the workers are united, the bour-geoisie, being bourgeois, cannot help getting at each other’s throats and fighting for an extra bit of profit. 
 “And so we have emerged victorious from the first two years of the Civil War, which were the hardest years of all, because we had been ruined by the imperialist war and were cut off from grain and coal supplies. 
 But now we have grain and fuel in abundance. 
 In Siberia the grain requisitioned alone amounted to twenty-one million poods. 
 It is true thatwe cannot get it out immediately, but then, the transportsystem has broken down all over Europe, and in our countryit was deliberately disrupted by the whiteguards. 
 They blewup all the bridges on the Dnieper, except the Kiev bridge, and this explains both the delay in the military operations and the delay in the transport of grain. 
 We have the Guryevoil and shall transport it as soon as the offshore ice on theCaspian melts. 
 We are bearing all this in mind, and are pre-paring to transport the oil. 
 We are creating labour armiesto restore the railways; one of them has already started to build a railway from Alexandrov-Gai to Guryev for the transport of oil. 
 We cannot demobilise the army because westill have enemies, such as Poland. 
 Demobilisation is alsobeing hampered by the transport break-down. 
 We shalltherefore use the army to restore the railways. 
 “The whiteguards keep saying in their sheets that the Bolsheviks are doing fine propaganda and are sparing no money for the purpose. 
 But the people have heard all sortsof propaganda—they have heard the propaganda of the white-guards and the propaganda of the Constituent Assemblysupporters. 
 It is absurd to think that they have followed theBolsheviks because their propaganda was the more skilful. 
 No, the point is that their propaganda was truthful. 
 “The very deeds of Denikin and Kolchak were propaganda against them and in favour of the Soviet system. 
 That iswhy we won. 
 We overthrew the tsar easily in a few hours. 
We overthrew the landowners and capitalists in a few weeks. 
But that was only half the job. 
 We have to learn to work in a new way. 
 Formerly it was the exploiter who organised labour and hunger that united labour; now labour must beunited by the workers and peasants realising that theymust work in order to escape from this dire situation. 
 “But this is not yet implanted in everyone’s mind, and we are starting a new and bloodless fight to bring it home. 
 All previous revolutions ended to the advantage of a handful of capitalists and exploiters. 
 That was because the insurrection-ary working people had no sense of solidarity, each thought only of himself, they all fought one another, and it was the swindlers and profiteers who came out on top. 
 “You have a peasant who has grain, and side by side with him there is a hungry man, and the peasant prefers tosell grain to the hungry man for a thousand rubles ratherthan loan it to the workers’ government. 
 Somebody hereeven says ‘Hear, hear!’ Well, both Denikin and Kolchaktried freedom of trade, but the best, politically-conscious workers and peasants saw what this meant in practice and turned their backs on them. 
 “In the old days they used to say, ‘Each for himself, and God for all. 
’ And how much misery resulted from it. 
 “We say, ‘Each for all, and we’ll somehow manage with-out God. 
’ And we shall strive for a fraternal alliance between the workers and the peasants who loan their grain to the state—it has to be a loan, because at present we are unableto give anything in return; bits of coloured paper are notmoney. 
 Hitherto we have had to fight just to prevent theenemy from strangling us; but now, when an enemy muchstronger than us has been defeated, our hands are free, and we must set about the job of building a new life and, in the first place, must restore the railways. 
 “In the South we have repair shops captured by the Red Army in places where grain is close, so let these repair shopswork at full speed, in three shifts, and not in the way starv-ing people work. 
 “We must concentrate the whole force of our Communist propaganda, with the help of which we defeated the foreignenemy, on the restoration of the railways. 
 “We once had a ‘splendid’ foreign trade and used to export 700,000,000 poods of grain annually. 
 Russian and foreignmillionaires made fortunes on this business, while the Russian workers and peasants starved. 
 Now we must convince everybody that the only salvation is, ‘Everyone for all!’We must, whatever the cost, abolish freedom of trade andprofiteering, which mean bread for a small handful andstarvation for the rest. 
 We must convince the peasants—and they will believe us, because Denikin demonstrated to them the ‘blessings’ of freedom of profiteering, they will understand that the only salvation is for them to give grainas a loan to the worker and artisan, and that these will repay the loan not in bits of coloured paper but in textiles and other goods. 
 “We have started a great war, a war which we shall not end soon. 
 This is a bloodless war waged by the armies oflabour on starvation, cold and typhus, a war for an enlight-ened, bright, well-fed and healthy Russia. 
 But we shall endthis war with a victory as decisive as the one with whichwe ended the struggle against the whiteguards.... 
” In reply to a question about the terms of the peace with Estonia, Comrade Lenin said that we had made many con-cessions, the chief of which was the cession of disputedterritory inhabited by a mixed population—Russians andEstonians. 
 But we did not want to shed the blood of workersand Red Army soldiers for the sake of a piece of land, all the more that this concession was not being made for ever. 
 Estonia was passing through a Kerensky period; the workerswere beginning to realise the vileness of their ConstituentAssembly leaders, who had plundered the trade unions andhad murdered twenty Communists. 
 They would soon over-throw this government and set up a Soviet Estonia, he said, which would conclude a new peace with us.

 18, Published according to January 28, 1920 the Pravda text DRAF T DECISIONS AND DIRECTIVE S ON CO-OPERATIVE S94 Tomorrow at the Council of People’s Commissars table a draft decree, not on a merger for the co-operatives but on the completion of the unification of all types of co-opera-tive, rewriting O. 
 J. 
 Schmidt’s proposal so that a mostcautious attitude is displayed to local producers’ co-opera-tives, and the Council of Co-operative Congresses is abol-ished in the shortest period. 
 Directives: (α) More attention to be paid to the needs of the working people and not only of the affluent and kulak section. 
Change the formula of the preamble in this spirit. 
 (β) More extensive aid for producers’ co-operatives with local initiative specially developed, and improved methodsof farming and industry encouraged. 
 (γ) Concrete steps by the new Central Co-operative Society for the unification of producers’ co-operatives to be carriedout with the approval of the Council of People’s Commis-sars. 
 (a) Instruct Tsyurupa and Lezhava to table a draft deci-sion at the Council of People’s Commissars (without decid-ing in advance whether it is to be published) formulating more precise, systematic and concrete rules for the partic-ipation of co-operatives in the procurement of various food-stuffs, and for the ways and forms, terms and methods bywhich this participation is to be effected. 
 (b) Instruct the Central Statistical Board, in agreement with the Central Union of Consumers’ Societies, the People’sFood Commissariat and the Supreme Economic Council, todraw up by ... a programme of sample surveys of the methods and results of food procurement in the localities with and without the participation of the co-operatives. 
 The programme to be tabled at the Council of People’s Commissars for approval and for the actual appointment ofthe survey. 
 Think about whether a questionnaire can be used, and if it can, submit a brief draft of it to the Council of People’sCommissars. 
 Purpose of the survey: the detailed analysis of facts that may be few but are typical and properly verified of howproducts were gathered, which products and in what quanti-ties, how they were delivered, guarded and transported, over what distance, etc. 
 Number of cases of coercion, and what sort of coercion. 
 Supply of goods in exchange, what sort,and what quantities. 
 The percentage of compulsory deliv-eries and surpluses obtained and in what period. 
 Theparticipation of various groups of peasants in the deliveryof grain (and in receiving goods, if they were available). 
 Written on January 26, 1920 Published according to First published in the Fourth (Russian) the manuscript Edition of the Collected Works SPEECH DELIVERE D AT THE THIR D ALL-RUSSI A CONGRESS OF ECONOMI C COUNCIL S95 JANUARY 27, 1920 NEWSPAPER REPORT Comrade Lenin said that he would only touch lightly on those questions which he had had lately to deal with most. 
 One of them was the organisation of administration—the question of corporate management or one-man manage-ment. 
 96 In the controversies on this subject the question had been discussed on the basis of abstract reasoning in which the superiority of corporate management over indi-vidual management was argued. 
 But this led very far awayfrom the practical tasks of the moment. 
 Such argumentswent back to an early stage in the development of the Soviet system, a stage that had already passed. 
 It was time to put the matter on a more business-like footing. 
 “Corporate management,” continued Lenin, “as the chief type of organisation of Soviet administration, is somethingembryonic, something needed in the early stages, when youhave to start from scratch. 
 But when more or less stable forms have been established, the transition to practical work involves individual management, for that system bestensures the most effective utilisation of human abilities, anda real, not verbal, verification of work done. 
 “The experience of the Soviet government in army organ-isation must not be regarded as something isolated. 
 War embraces all forms of organisation in all spheres. 
 The devel-opment of our army led to successful results only because itwas carried on in the spirit of general Soviet organisation, on the basis of class relations that affect all development. 
 We find here the same thin layer of the leading class, the proletariat, and the peasantry forming the mass. 
 The na-ture of this relationship may not have been so fully apparentin other spheres, but it was thoroughly tested in the army,which stands face to face with the enemy and pays dearlyfor every mistake. 
 This experience is worth thinking about. 
Developing systematically, it passed from a corporate form that was casual and vague to a corporate form elevated to the status of a system of organisation and permeating allthe institutions of the army; and now, as a general tendency,it has arrived at the principle of one-man responsibility asthe only correct method of work. 
 In any sphere of Sovietwork you will find a small number of politically-conscious proletarians, a mass of less developed proletarians and, as the substratum, a huge mass of peasants, all of whose habitstend towards private enterprise and, consequently, towardsfreedom of trade and profiteering, which the Mensheviks,the Socialist-Revolutionaries and non-party people callfreedom, but which we call the heritage of capitalism. 
 These are the conditions under which we have to act, and they call for relevant methods. 
 And taking the experienceof the army, we find in the organisation of its administrationa systematic development from the original forms, from thecorporate principle to the individual principle, which isnow being applied there in at least a half of all cases. 
 “At best, corporate management involves a tremendous waste of forces and is not suited to the rapid and accuratework demanded by the conditions of centralised large-scaleindustry. 
 If you take the advocates of corporate management,you will find that their resolutions formulate, in an ex-tremely abstract way, the concept that every member of a collegium must be held individually responsible for the fulfilment of its tasks. 
 That for us is now elementary. 
 Butthose of you who have had practical experience know thatonly in one case out of a hundred is this actually adhered to. 
In the vast majority of cases it remains on paper. 
 No memberof a collegium is assigned precise duties and held personally responsible for the performance of those duties. 
 Generally, there is no verification of work done. 
 Let us assume thatthe Central Committee of a trade union nominates Vasily Vasilyevich Vasilyev for some office, and you ask to see a list of assignments performed by him and verified by effi-cient people—you will not get anything of the kind. 
 We are all of us only just beginning to adopt really efficient methods. 
 “Our fault is that we imagine we can do everything our-selves. 
 Our most acute shortcoming is a lack of executives,yet we do not know how to draw them from the rank-and-file workers and peasants, among whom there is an abun-dance of talented administrators and organisers. 
 It would be much better if we abandoned general, and in most casesabsolutely sterile, controversy for business-like methods,and that as soon as possible. 
 We would then really be car-rying out the duties of organisers of the advanced class, andwould pick out hundreds and thousands of new talented organisers. 
 We must promote them, test them, assign them tasks, tasks of greater and greater complexity. 
 I hope thatafter the Congress of the Economic Councils, after havingreviewed the work done, we shall take this path and increaseand multiply the number of organisers, so as to reinforce andenlarge that exceedingly thin layer which has been worn to shreds during the past two years. 
 For in order to accom-plish the task we are setting ourselves, that of saving Russiafrom poverty, hunger and cold, we need ten times moreorganisers, who would be answerable to tens of millions ofpeople. 
 “The second of the questions which interest us most is that of the labour armies. 
 “The task confronting us here concerns the transition from one stage of activity to another. 
 The stage that waswholly taken up by war is not yet over but there are a num-ber of signs which show that the Russian capitalists will notbe able to continue the war, although there is no doubt that they will attempt to invade Russia. 
 And we must be on our guard. 
 Nevertheless, the war they launched against us twoyears ago has, by and large, ended in victory for us, and weare now going over to peaceful tasks. 
 “The peculiar character of this transition must be under-stood. 
 Here we have a country which is in a state of utter ruin, a country suffering from hunger and cold, where pov-erty has reached desperate extremes, and in that countrythe people have risen in their might, and gained confidence in themselves when they realised that they are capable of withstanding the entire world—without exaggeration, the entire world, for the entire capitalist world has suffered defeat. 
 And in these peculiar conditions we are proposingto form a labour army to solve urgent problems. 
 “We must concentrate on the main thing, namely, on collecting grain and transporting it to the centre. 
 Everydeviation from this task, the least diffusion of effort, will entail the gravest peril, the ruin of our cause. 
 And in order to utilise our apparatus with the greatest possible dispatch,we must create a labour army. 
 You already have the thesesof the Central Committee and the reports on this subject,and I shall not go into the actual details of the question. 
I only want to say that at this moment of transition from civil war to the new tasks we must transfer everything to the labour front and there concentrate all our forces, withthe utmost effort and with ruthless, military determination. 
We shall not allow any deviations now. 
 In launching thisslogan we declare that we must strain all the live forces ofthe workers and peasants to the utmost and demand that they give us every help in this matter. 
 And then, by creating a labour army, by harnessing all the forces of the workersand peasants, we shall accomplish our main task. 
 We shallsucceed in procuring hundreds of millions of poods of grain. 
We have them already. 
 But it will require incredible effort,devilish effort, the harnessing of all the forces of the country, added to military determination and energy, to get these hundreds of millions of poods of grain and transport themto the centre. 
 Here, in the centre, we shall be engaged chieflyin drawing up a plan for this and shall be talking chieflyof this; as to all other questions—finance, industrial develop-ment and all questions relating to broad programmes—they should not be allowed to divert our attention at the moment. 
 That is the chief thing facing us today—to resist the dangerof being carried away by far-reaching plans and schemes. 
We must concentrate on the chief and fundamental thing,and not permit attention to be diverted from the main taskwe have set ourselves, namely, to procure grain and food-stuffs, to procure them through the state, at fixed prices, in the socialist way of the workers’ state—and not in the capi-talist way, by means of profiteering—and to transport them to the centre, overcoming the chaos on the railways. 
 It would be a crime on anybody’s part to forget this task. 
 “In order to place the performance of our main task on more or less correct lines, the leaders of all our governmentbodies, and of the economic councils in particular, mustrouse the activities of tens of millions of workers and peas-ants. 
 For this purpose a broad plan for the reconstructionof Russia will be drawn up. 
 We have sufficient means for it: resources, technical potentialities, raw materials, every-thing required to enable us to begin this work of reconstruc-tion everywhere, enlisting all the workers and peasants. 
We shall launch a persistent struggle, comrades, a strugglewhich will demand heavy sacrifices during this period on thelabour front, but it is a struggle we must inevitably wage, because we are suffering from hunger, cold, transport dis-location and typhus. 
 We must combat these evils and begineverywhere to build up our state on the basis of large-scale,machine-industry methods, so as to make our country a cul-tured country and, by a correct socialist struggle, get outof the quagmire in which the countries of world capitalism and imperialism are at present submerged.

 The delivery of grain has ceased . 
 Truly urgent measures are needed to save the country. 
 In the course oftwo months (February and March) the following measuresmust be effected (and other relevant measures of a similarnature must be sought): I. 
 The personal bread ration to be reduced for those not working on the railways and increased for those working on them. 
 Let more thousands perish but the country will be saved.

 Three-fourths of the leading executives of all de-partments, except the Commissariats of Food and the Army, to be taken for the railways and for repair work for these two months. 
 The work of other commissariats tobe discontinued (or reduced to one-tenth) correspondinglyfor these two months.

Introduce martial law over an area stretching to 30-50 versts on either side of the railway line to mobilise labour to clear the line, and transfer to the volosts within that area three-fourths of all high-ranking functionaries of the volost and uyezd executive committees of the guberniaconcerned. 
 First published in 1924 Published according to the manuscript REPOR T ON THE WORK OF THE ALL-RUSSI A CENTRA L EXECUTIVE COMMITTE E AND THE COUNCI L OF PEOPL E’S COMMISSAR S DELIVERE D AT THE FIRS T SESSION OF THE ALL-RUSSI A CENTRA L EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE , SEVENT H CONVOCATIO N97 FEBRUARY 2, 1920 Comrades, my report on the activities of the Council of People’s Commissars and the All-Russia Central Execu-tive Committee, whose functions in periods between meet-ings have been carried out by the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, falls naturally intotwo main subdivisions—the first on foreign policy, theSoviet Republic’s international position, and the second on internal development and our main economic tasks. 
 Allow me to present to you in that order the main facts of ourwork during the period under review, i. 
e. 
, during the pasttwo months. 
 As far as the Soviet Republic’s international position is concerned, it has been determined in the main by the suc-cesses of the Red Army. 
 As you know, the last remnants of Kolchak’s army in the Far East have been almost wiped out,while the rivalry and enmity between Japan and America,nominally allies, are becoming more and more obvious andprevent them from fully developing their onslaught againstthe Soviet Republic. 
 After the annihilation of Yudenich’s troops and after the capture, in the South, of Novocherkassk and Rostov-on-Don in early January, their main forcessuffered so decisive a blow that the Soviet Republic’s military position radically changed, and although the war was not over, every country saw clearly that its former hopes of crushing the military forces of the Soviet Republic had collapsed. 
 Acknowledgement of this radical change in the Soviet Republic’s international position was shown by the wire-less message to us (not delivered officially) of the decisionof the Allied Council adopted on January 16 to lift the blockade against the Soviet Republic. 
 The main section of the decision taken by the Council says ... ( reads ). 
 98 There is no need for me to criticise the diplomacy con-tained in this formulation; it is so striking that it is notworth wasting time saying that the attitude of the Alliesto Russia remains unchanged. 
 If that is how the Allies un-derstand their policy—that the lifting of the blockade does not change it—then it shows how unsound their policy is. 
The importance of this decision for us, however, is in itseconomic, not its political, aspect. 
 Lifting the blockadeis a fact of major international significance showing thata new stage in the socialist revolution has begun. 
 For the blockade was in fact the principal, really strong weapon with which the imperialists of the world wanted to strangleSoviet Russia. 
 At the last Congress of Soviets I had occasion to state and expand the idea that the struggle against Soviet Russiahad resulted, not only in the workers and peasants of France, Britain and other advanced countries forcing the imperial-ists to renounce the struggle, but in the mass of the pettybourgeoisie within these countries becoming opponents ofthe blockade. 
 And of course, this opposition by the middlesections of the population in countries like Britain andFrance was bound to influence international imperialist policy. 
 Knowing their brand of diplomacy, we cannot expect them to act in a straightforward manner, withoutany reservations, without wanting to restore the past, or bysome cunning trick or other return to their previous policy,which they cannot pursue openly at the moment. 
 It must besaid, however, that on the whole we have gained tremendous victories, that we have even been able to deprive the Allies of a weapon which only they possessed—the navy, despitethe fact that waverers tried to scare us by saying the navy was invincible. 
 Nevertheless, the development of political relations showed that even this invincible navy was in no fit state to fight us. 
 We, who were unable to put up any naval resistance, forced the imperialist powers to abandon thisweapon. 
 Of course, this change in policy on the international scene does not have an immediate effect, but the fact remainsthat we have now entered the sphere of world-wide interna-tional relations, and this enables us to get support from the more advanced countries. 
 It is true that economically andfinancially these countries are in a sorry plight, they areall going downhill, and we cannot expect much from them;but with the opportunity to develop our own industry, wecan count on receiving machinery for production, machi-nery for the restoration of our industry. 
 And above all, that which had cut us off completely, by means of theblockade, from the advanced countries, has been broken down. 
 After the Allied Council had been forced to abandon this weapon our victories in the field of international politicscontinued, the greatest of them being that we succeeded in concluding peace with Estonia. 
 We received a communi-cation from Joffe and Gukovsky today saying: “Today,February 2, at 2 a. 
m. 
 Moscow time, peace was concludedbetween Russia and Estonia. 
 The Estonian Minister forForeign Affairs, Birk, arrived from Revel to sign the docu-ment. 
 ” Comrades, the text of this peace document which was discussed at great length and is of tremendous importancehas been sent by messenger who should arrive tomorrowmorning, but we have now received the exact text by tele-graph, and it will be distributed tomorrow. 
 It will be dis-cussed and ratified. 
 This document is of the highest impor-tance to us. 
 The peace treaty between Russia and Estonia is of epoch-making significance. 
 We have succeeded in con-cluding a peace treaty with a government which is also becom-ing democratic and whose relations with us will now bestable, but which up to now has been supported by the wholeimperialist world. 
 Therefore we must regard this as an act of tremendous historical importance. 
 We know that people who stand between imperialism and democracy usually go over to one side or the other. 
 So you see, we have undoubtedly gained a victory, because peace has been concluded, and this government must now proceed against our enemy. 
 The theoretical significance of this fact is that in the imperialist epoch the whole world is splitinto a vast number of big and small states, the small statesbeing absolutely helpless, an insignificant group comparedto the rich powers which completely dominate a numberof small, weak states. 
 Imperialism is the epoch in which the division of the whole world takes place, when the whole of the world’s population is divided into a minority ofexploiting, oppressor countries, and a majority of countrieswith small, weak populations that exist in a state of colo-nial dependence on the minority. 
 When we won peace with Estonia we proved that we were able to go forward as a proletarian and communist state. 
 How have we done this? We have shown all the belligerentEntente powers who are opposed to peace that the sympathywe are able to evoke among our opponents and bourgeoisgovernments, the sympathy of a small country, is morepowerful than all that military oppression, all that finan-cial aid and all those economic ties which link that small country to the powerful world states. 
 The Entente hasseen that it is not only when we use force that we are ableto win; we are in a position to refute the lie and slanderspread against us by the bourgeois governments of the worldwhen they say the Bolsheviks retain power by force alone. 
 What was it that enabled us to prevail over the combined forces of world imperialism in regard to Estonia, a countrywhich had always suffered violence at the hands of theRussia of the tsars and landowners? It was our proving ourability to renounce, in all sincerity, the use of force at theappropriate moment, in order to change to a peace policy, and so win the sympathy of the bourgeois government of a small country, regardless of all the support given it byinternational capital. 
 This is a fact of historical signifi-cance. 
 Estonia is a small country, a small republic, but sheis oppressed economically and militarily in a thousandand one ways by world imperialist capital, so much so that her entire population comes under this oppression. 
 And this peace now proves that we can, in spite of our exhaus-tion, weakness and disarray, gain the upper hand over the whiteguard army with its imperialist backing. 
 The powerful Entente knows how to reply to force with even more trium-phant force, but this peace proves that we do not have to resort to force to win the sympathy and support of the bour-geoisie. 
 A most difficult international problem has arisen here. 
 The rate of capitalist development in different countriesvaries; this development takes place under different condi-tions, in various ways and by various means. 
 A socialist republic in one country exists alongside all the capitalistcountries of the world and causes their bourgeoisie towaver. 
 From this they concluded that our position wasa hopeless one; we had defeated the whiteguards by force,but what, they asked, were we going to do about the rest of the world? We shall defeat that too. 
 The peace with Estonia proves that this is no empty phrase. 
 The entirepressure of international capital was overcome in that areawhere our rejection of the use of force was recognised to besincere. 
 “Don’t make peace with the Bolsheviks, otherwisewe shall conquer you by starvation; we shall give you neither financial nor economic aid,” said world capital. 
 And Estonia proved to be one of the small, formallyindependent countries which said to herself, “We rely moreon the fact that the Bolsheviks are able to live in peacewith other, weaker nations, even with a bourgeois govern-ment, than we do on the whole powerful democratic coun-tries of the Entente. 
” Democracy is most clearly manifested in the fundamental question of war and peace. 
 All the powers are preparing afresh imperialist war, and this is seen daily by the workersof the world. 
 Any day now America and Japan will hurlthemselves at each other; Britain grabbed so many colonies after her victory over Germany that the other imperialist powers will never resign themselves to this. 
 A new fanaticalwar is being prepared, and the people are aware of this. 
And just at this moment Russia, with her huge forces, whois accused of intending to fling those forces against a smallstate as soon as she has finished with Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin—Russia has concluded a democratic peace with Estonia. 
 Furthermore, the terms of the peace treaty providefor a number of territorial concessions on our part which do not completely correspond to the strict observance of the principle of self-determination of nations, and prove in practice that the question of frontiers is of secondary impor-tance to us, the question of peaceful relations, however, thequestion of our ability to await the development of theconditions of life of each nation, is not only an importantquestion of principle, it is also a matter in which we havesucceeded in winning the confidence of nations hostile to us. 
 It is no accident that we have achieved this in relation to Estonia; it is evidence that the weak proletarian republic,existing in isolation and apparently helpless, has begun towin to its side countries dependent on the imperialiststates—and they constitute the vast majority. 
 That iswhy our peace with Estonia is of such great historical significance. 
 No matter how the Entente strives to start a war—even if it succeeds in turning peace onceagain into war—the fact will remain, firmly establishedin history, that despite all the pressure of internationalcapital we were able to inspire greater confidence in asmall country ruled by the bourgeoisie than the so-called democratic, but in reality predatory, imperialist bourgeoisie. 
 We by chance came to possess some very interesting documents showing how our policy compared with that ofthe allegedly democratic, but in actual fact predatory,powers of the whole world, which please permit me to read to you. 
 These documents were furnished by a whiteguard officer or official named Oleinikov who was commissioned byone whiteguard government to hand over some highly impor-tant documents to another. 
 But he handed them over tous instead. 
 99 (Applause . 
) It proved possible to send these documents to Russia, and I shall read them to you, although it will take some time to do so. 
 Nevertheless, they are very interesting for they very clearly reveal the hiddensprings of policy.

(In code) The State Department acquainted me verbally with the instructions given to Gade. 
 He is appointed the Commissar of the Amer-ican Government in the Baltic Provinces of Russia. 
 He is not accredit-ed to any Russian Government. 
 His mission is to observe and inform. 
 His behaviour must not lead the local population to expect that the American Government could agree to support separatist trends goingbeyond autonomy. 
 On the contrary, the American Government truststhat the population of the Baltic Provinces will help their Russianbrothers in their work of general state importance. 
 The instructions arebased on the interpretation of the agreement of the Allied governments with the Supreme Ruler as outlined in my memorandum of June 17 to the government. 
 Gade has been given extracts from the recentspeeches of the President in which he fulminates against Bolshevism. 
 So, the American Government intimates that its repre-sentative can issue any kind of instructions but may not support independence, i. 
e. 
, may not guarantee the independ-ence of these states. 
 This is what directly or indirectlycame to light, and Estonia could not be kept in ignoranceof the fact that she was being deceived by the Great Powers.

 (In code) Knox has given the Supreme Ruler the message of the British War Office in which the latter warns of the inclination of theBaltic states to conclude a peace with the Bolsheviks who guaranteethem immediate recognition of their independence. 
 At the same timethe British War Office raises the question of the advisability of paralys-ing this pledge by satisfying, in its turn, the wishes of the states indi-cated. 
 We replied to Knox by referring to the principles outlined in theNote of the Supreme Ruler to the Powers on June 4, and, in addition,we pointed out that the conclusion of a peace between the Baltic statesand the Bolsheviks would be undoubtedly fraught with danger sincethis would permit the release of part of the Soviet forces and would clear the way to the infiltration of Bolshevism in the West. 
 The mere fact that they are ready to talk peace is in our opinion evidence of theutter demoralisation of the parties of these self-governing entities which cannot protect themselves from the penetration of aggressive Bolshevism. 
 Expressing the conviction that the Powers could not approve of the further spread of Bolshevism, we pointed to the necessity of withdraw-ing all aid from the Baltic states since this would be a real means of exerting influence by the Powers, and is more advisable than competi-tion in promises with the Bolsheviks, who now have nothing to lose. 
 In transmitting the above, I would request you to make similar representations in Paris and London; we are making a special ap-proach to Bakhmetev.

 He adds, however, that as wehave shipping, we could arrange supplies for Yudenich on a commercial basis, providing we obtain credits. 
 At the same time General Radcliffe admits that Yudenich’s army must be properly equipped since it is“the only force among the Baltic states able to engage in active opera-tions against the Bolsheviks”.

(In code) The State Department informed me in confidence that it is true that the envoy in Stockholm, Morris, and particularly Hapgoodin Copenhagen, are well known for their Left sympathies, but thatthey have no influence or authority here, and that the government is obliged to admonish them from time to time, categorically pointing out that American policy is one of undeviating support of ourgovernment in the struggle against the Bolsheviks. 
 Here are all the documents which we shall publish and which clearly show how the battle went on around Estonia,how the Entente, Britain and France, together with Kol-chak and America, all brought pressure to bear on Estonia with the one aim of preventing the signing of a peace treaty with the Bolsheviks, and how the Bolsheviks, pledging themselves to territorial concessions and guaranteeingindependence, won this trial of strength. 
 I state that thisvictory is of gigantic historical significance, because it hasbeen gained without the use of force. 
 This victory overworld imperialism is a victory that is bringing the Bolshe-viks the sympathy of the whole world. 
 This victory by no means denotes that universal peace will be concluded imme-diately; but it does show that we-represent the peace inter-ests of the majority of the world’s population against theimperialist war-mongers. 
 Such an assessment of the situa-tion has induced bourgeois Estonia, an opponent of commu-nism, to conclude peace with us. 
 Since we, a proletarian state, a Soviet republic, are concluding a peace treaty,since we are acting in a spirit of peace towards bourgeoisgovernments oppressed by the great magnates of imperial-ism, we must be able to decide from this how our interna-tional policy is to be shaped. 
 The main task we set ourselves is to defeat the exploiters and to win to our side the waverers—this is a task of histor-ic significance. 
 Among the waverers are a whole numberof bourgeois states which, as bourgeois states, detest us,but which, on the other hand, as oppressed states, preferpeace with us. 
 This explains the peace with Estonia. 
 This peace is, of course, only a first step, and its influence will only be felt in the future, but that it will be felt is a fact. 
Up to now we have negotiated with Latvia only throughthe Red Cross, 100 and the same is true of our negotiations with the Polish Government. 
 I repeat—the peace with Esto-nia is bound to influence events because the basis is identi-cal; the same attempts are being made to goad Latvia and Poland into making war on Russia as were made in the caseof Estonia. 
 Perhaps these attempts will prove successful,and since war with Poland is possible, we must be vigilant,but we are certain—this has been demonstrated by our mainachievements—that we can conclude peace and make concessions which permit the development of any form of democracy. 
 This is now especially important because thePolish question is particularly acute. 
 We have received a number of communications indicating that apart from bourgeois, conservative, landowning Poland, apart from the pressure being exerted by all capitalist parties in Poland, all the Entente powers are doing their utmost to incitePoland to make war against us. 
 As you know, the Council of People’s Commissars has issued an appeal to the working people of Poland. 
 101 W e are going to ask you to endorse this appeal as a means of fighting that campaign of calumny in which Polish landown-ing circles are engaged. 
 We shall submit an additionaltext of an appeal to the working people of Poland. 
 Thisappeal will be a blow to the imperialist powers, who aredoing their utmost to incite Poland against us; for us theinterests of the majority of the people take first place. 
 I shall now acquaint you with a telegram intercepted by us yesterday, which illustrates the attempts of Americancapital to present us in a certain light and thereby drag usinto a war with Poland. 
 The telegram says ( reads ). 
 I have said and heard nothing of the sort, but they are able to liebecause it is not for nothing that they spend their money on spreading lying rumours that have a definite aim. 
 Their bourgeois government guarantees them this. 
 ( Continues reading the telegram . 
) This telegram was sent from Europe to America and was paid for out of capitalist funds; it servesas a shameless means of provoking a war with Poland. 
American capital is doing its utmost to bring pressure to bear on Poland and does this unashamedly, making it appear that the Bolsheviks want to finish with Kolchak and Deni-kin in order to throw all their “iron troops” againstPoland. 
 It is important that we should here and now endorse the decision of the Council of People’s Commissars, and then we must do what we did previously in relation to other states, and also what we did in regard to the troops of Kolchak andDenikin. 
 We must immediately appeal to the Polish peopleand explain the real state of affairs. 
 We know full well thatthis method of ours has a most positive effect in tendingto disrupt the ranks of our enemy. 
 And in the end, this method will lead on to the path we need, the path on to which it has led the working population of all countries. 
This policy must make a definite beginning—no matter how difficult this may prove—and once a beginning is made, we shall carry it through to completion. 
 I must mention that we have been pursuing the same policy in respect of all other countries. 
 We invited Georgiaand Azerbaijan to conclude an agreement against Denikin. 
They refused, pleading non-interference in the affairs ofother countries. 
 We shall see how the workers and peasantsof Georgia and Azerbaijan regard this. 
 This policy has been applied even more cautiously in respect of the Western nations than in dealing with the na-tions of Russia. 
 It involved such countries as Latvia, Esto-nia, Poland and, on the other hand, a number of Easterncountries whose developmental level is the same as that ofmost of those colonial countries which constitute the major-ity of the world’s population. 
 They are kept down by Brit-ain, who continues to hold colonial slaves under her sway. 
Our policy in relation to West-European countries has beenvery cautious—it will take some time for them to get overtheir own Kerensky period—but our policy in the Eastmust be even more cautious and patient, for here we are dealing with countries that are much more backward, are under the oppressive influence of religious fanaticism, areimbued with greater distrust of the Russian people, andfor decades and centuries were oppressed by the tsaristgovernment’s capitalist and imperialist policy, by the pol-icy conducted towards these nations by Russia as the domi-nant nation. 
 We have granted autonomy to the Bashkir Republic. 
 102 We must found an autonomous Tatar Republic. 
103 W e shall continue the same policy in relation to all the Easternpeoples, and say to ourselves that we, who are faced bya huge front of imperialist powers, we, who are fighting impe-rialism, represent an alliance that requires close military unity, and any attempt to violate this unity we regard asabsolutely impermissible, as a betrayal of the struggleagainst international imperialism. 
 However, in implement-ing this policy we must be even more cautious. 
 For if theEuropean countries have to go through a Kerensky period, in the countries that are at a lower developmental level there are even greater elements of distrust, and it will requiremore time to influence them. 
 We support the independence /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR and sovereignty of these countries. 
 We appeal to their working people. 
 We say: unity of the military forces is im-perative; any deviation from this unity is impermissible. 
 We are confident that, by systematically pursuing our policy of close alliance, we shall achieve greater successthan before in our relations with the peoples of the East. 
And our success is already great. 
 The Soviet Republic en-joys tremendous popularity among all the Eastern peoples for the same reason that made it possible for us to conclude a peace treaty with a small Western state, because theysee in us an unswerving fighter against imperialism,because ours is the only republic which is waging a waragainst imperialism and is capable of utilising every situa-tion without the use of force, and which is also able to gain a victory by renouncing the use of force. 
 Needless to say, a far more perfected variety of this policy is being implemented in relation to the Ukrainian Repub-lic. 
 Here the problem has been simplified by the prior con-clusion of an agreement between the All-Russia CentralExecutive Committee and the Central Executive Committee of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. 
 104 On the basis of this agreement, which implies a close federation of both repub-lics in the struggle against the imperialist countries, weare building an ever closer alliance. 
 As a result of their bitterexperience of Denikin’s rule, the mass of Ukrainian peasantsand workers are becoming convinced that only the closest alliance between the Ukraine and the Russian Republic will be really invincible in the face of international imperial-ism, and that at the time of struggle against imperialismthere is nothing to be gained by the separation of the Ukraini-an state, since imperialism will take advantage of everydivision to crush Soviet power. 
 Such a division is criminal. 
 Our policy is taking deep root in the Ukraine, and we are confident that the forthcoming All-Ukraine Congress ofSoviets of Workers and Peasants will officially endorse thispolicy. 
 These are the few remarks to which I must limitmyself on the question of the international situation. 
I shall ask this session to endorse all the practical proposals I have to make (I have enumerated them) on behalf of the Council of People’s Commissars and the All-Russia CentralExecutive Committee. 
 In passing on to the work of internal development I must first deal with certain measures taken by our government, and then proceed to the most important matter of all—the change-over to a new course, the transition from militarytasks to those of state organisation. 
 In regard to our internal policy for the two months under review, among the main measures which more or less standout from a number of current tasks, the following decision requiring the endorsement of the All-Russia Central Exec-utive Committee is of particular importance. 
 This is thedecision to abolish the death penalty. 
 As you know, immedi-ately after the main victory over Denikin, after the captureof Rostov, Comrade Dzerzhinsky, the People’s Commissarfor Internal Affairs, who is in charge of the Cheka, submit-ted a proposal to the Council of People’s Commissars, and had it endorsed in his own department, that the passing ofall death sentences by the Cheka be abolished. 
 When bour-geois democracy in Europe does all in its power to spread thelies that Soviet Russia is predominantly terrorist, when thislie is spread about us by bourgeois democracy and by the socialists of the Second International, when Kautsky writes a special book entitled Terrorism and Communism in which he declares that communist power is based on terrorism,then you can well imagine the kind of lies spread on thissubject. 
 In order to refute this lie we have decided on thestep taken by Comrade Dzerzhinsky, endorsed by the Coun-cil of People’s Commissars, and which now needs the ap-proval of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. 
 We were forced to use terror in response to the terror employed by the Entente, when the mighty powers of theworld flung their hordes against us, stopping at nothing. 
We could not have lasted two days had we not replied to these attempts of officers and whiteguards in a merciless fashion. 
 This meant the use of terror, but this was forced onus by the terrorist methods of the Entente. 
 But as soonas we had gained a decisive victory, even before the end ofthe war, immediately after the capture of Rostov, we re-nounced capital punishment, and have therefore proved that we intend to carry out our own programme as we had prom-ised. 
 We say that the use of violence arises from the needto crush the exploiters, the landowners and capitalists. 
 When this is accomplished we shall renounce all extraordi-nary measures. 
 We have proved this in practice. 
 And I think, I hope, and I am confident that the All-Russia Central Executive Committee will unanimously endorsethis measure of the Council of People’s Commissars andwill implement it in such a way that it will be impossibleto apply the death penalty in Russia. 
 Needless to say, anyattempt by the Entente to resume methods of war will force us to reintroduce the former terror; we know that we are living in a time of the law of the jungle, when kind wordsare of no avail. 
 This is what we had in mind, and as soon asthe decisive struggle was over, we immediately began toabolish measures which all other powers apply without anytime limit having been set. 
 Further, I should like to refer to the discussion on Work-ers’ Inspection. 
 There is to be a special report on thissubject, and it would be wrong of me to dwell too long onit. 
 The most important problem confronting us here is thatof drawing the mass of people into administrative work. 
This is a more acute problem than the task of large-scale development. 
 You will be presented with detailed plans, and when you have discussed and amended them, you willunderstand that this development must continue with fargreater participation by the mass of the workers. 
 This isour main task, with which it is extremely difficult to get togrips in the existing chaos, but nevertheless we are ap-proaching it steadily. 
 There is another question before us—the question of the co-operatives. 
 We have set ourselves the task of unitingthe whole population in co-operatives that differ from thosepreviously existing and which at best embraced only theupper sections of the population. 
 Socialism would be impossible if it did not make use of the technical knowledge, culture and the apparatus createdby bourgeois, capitalist civilisation. 
 Part of this apparatusis the co-operative movement whose growth is all the greaterthe higher the level of capitalist development in a country. 
We have set our co-operative movement the task of embrac-ing the whole country. 
 Up to now the co-operative move-ment involved only top sections and benefited those ableto pay their dues. 
 The working people, however, were unable to make use of its services. 
 We have resolutely bro-ken with this type of co-operative, but not so that the co-operative movement as such is completely wiped out, for in March and April 1918 we set the co-operatives the taskof drawing in the whole population. 
 If there are any co-oper-ators who value the ideas of the founders of the co-opera-tive movement (the old aims of co-operation were to satisfythe needs of the working people), they will sympathise with this aim. 
 We are certain that we have the sympathy of the majority of the members of the co-operative organi-sations, although we are by no means under the illusionthat we have won to our side the majority of the leaders,who subscribe to bourgeois and petty-bourgeois views, whosee co-operation merely as another form of capitalist economy and as the notorious freedom of trade which means fortunes for the few and ruin for the majority. 
 Instead of this, weannounced the country-wide task of the co-operatives toreally begin catering for the working people so that theyembrace the whole population. 
 This could not be accom-plished at once. 
 We have set ourselves this aim and have worked systematically, and will go on working, to achieve it, so that ultimately all the population will be united in co-operatives; and we can say with certainty that the wholeof the Soviet Republic, perhaps in a few weeks, or in a fewmonths, will become one great co-operative of workingpeople. 
 After this the development of independent activity by the working people, their participation in state develop-ment will proceed along even broader lines. 
 In accomplishing this, we have decided that all types, not only consumers’, but producers’, credit, and other co-operatives should, by appropriate stages and with due care,be amalgamated into a Central Union of Consumers’ Socie-ties. 
 We are confident that our steps in this direction will meet with the approval of the Central Executive Committeeand functionaries in the localities who, after the formalamalgamation of the co-operatives, will, by their work ofeconomic development, into which they will draw the major-ity of the workers and peasants, achieve what we regard as one of the major tasks—that of making the co-operative movement another prime factor in the struggle against redtape, this legacy from the old capitalist state, a struggle which our programme also declares to be of the highest importance. 
 We shall carry on this struggle in all offices and departments by every means and, incidentally, through the amalgamation of the co-operatives and by shifting theappeal from the bourgeois top people in the co-operativesto the genuine working people, who must all undertake in-dependent work in co-operative organisation. 
 From among the problems of internal development I now wish to refer to what has been done in the sphere of agricul-ture. 
 In order to place land tenure on a proper basis, thePeople’s Commissar for Agriculture in July 1919 issueda circular on measures against the frequent redistribution ofallotted land. 
 This circular was published on July 1 inIzvestia and was included in the Collection of Statutes and Decrees of the Workers ’ and Peasants ’ Government . 
 This circular is important because it meets the many suggestionsand demands of the peasants who pointed out that the fre-quent reallotment of the land in conditions of small-scalefarming prevented better labour discipline and the higherproductivity of labour. 
 This view is shared by the Council of People’s Commissars which has instructed the Commis-sariat of Agriculture to work out a draft decree on reallotmentprocedures. 
 This draft will be considered shortly. 
 Similarly,the People’s Commissariat of Agriculture has set itself thetask of implementing a number of urgent measures torestore livestock and farm equipment. 
 In this connection the systematic efforts of local officials themselves are extremely important, and we hope that the members of theAll-Russia Central Executive Committee will bring theappropriate pressure to bear on the authorities and renderassistance, so that these measures of the People’s Commis-sariat of Agriculture can be put into effect in the shortest space of time. 
 I shall now turn to the last, and in reality, the most important problem of our development—the problem ofthe labour armies and the labour mobilisation of the popula-tion. 
 The most difficult task in the sharp turns and changesof social life is that of taking due account of the peculiar features of each transition. 
 How socialists should fight within a capitalist society is not a difficult problem and haslong since been settled. 
 Nor is it difficult to visualise advanced socialist society. 
 This problem has also been settled. 
 But the most difficult task of all is how, in practice, to effect the transition from the old, customary, familiar capi-talism to the new socialism, as yet unborn and without anyfirm foundations. 
 At best this transition will take manyyears, in the course of which our policy will be dividedinto a number of even smaller stages. 
 And the whole difficultyof the task which falls to our lot, the whole difficulty of politics and the art of politics, lies in the ability to take into account the specific tasks of each of thesetransitions. 
 We have only just solved—though not yet fully—the problem of the war in its principal and basic features. 
Our main task was to repel at all costs the attack of the whiteguards. 
 Everything for the war effort, we said, and this was the correct policy. 
 We are fully aware that itcaused unparalleled hardships in the rear such as cold, fam-ine and devastation. 
 But the very fact that the Red Army—which, incidentally, is appreciated in the way shown by theexamples I have read out to you—has resolved this problem in a most backward country proves that new forces do exist in the country. 
 Otherwise the creation of this model army,and its victory over far better equipped armies, would havebeen inconceivable. 
 But now we have geared the entire stateapparatus to this task and have succeeded in surmountingthe specific features of the problem—the subordination of everything to the war effort—the situation demands a swift and sharp change in policy. 
 We have not yet finished thewar. 
 We must maintain our military readiness intact, wemust destroy Denikin’s troops, we must show the land-owners and capitalists of every country that if they want todeal with Russia by war, they will meet the same fate as Kolchak and Denikin. 
 We must not take a single step, there-fore, which would weaken our military strength. 
 At thesame time, however, we must switch the whole country onto a different course, reconstruct its whole mechanism. 
 Wecan no longer gear everything to the war effort, and wehave no need to, because in the main the problem of the war has been solved. 
 The task of the transition from war to peaceful develop-ment arises in such peculiar conditions that we cannot disband the army, since we have to allow, say, for the possi-bility of an attack by that selfsame Poland or any of the powers which the Entente continues to incite against us. 
 This specific feature of the problem of not being able toreduce our military forces, yet at the same time having toswitch the whole of the Soviet state machine which is gearedto war on to the new course of peaceful economic develop-ment, demands exceptional attention. 
 It is the type of prob-lem that general formulas, the general provisions of a pro-gramme, general communist principles cannot cope with,but which requires that the specific features of the transitionfrom capitalism to communism be taken into consideration,the transition from the position of a country whose wholeattention has been concentrated on the war to the position of a country which has won a decisive military victory and must go on to solve economic questions by military methods,because the situation, as you all realise, is extremely grave. 
The end of the winter will bring, has already brought, theworking people unbelievable hardships—cold, famine, de-vastation. 
 We must overcome this at all costs. 
 We know that we can do this. 
 It has been proved by the enthusiasm of the Red Army. 
 If, up to the present, we were able to battle on, surrounded on all sides and cut off from the richest areas of grain andcoal, now that we possess all this, now that it is possible tosolve the problems of economic development jointly with the Ukraine, we can solve the main problem—to acquire large quantities of grain and foodstuffs, deliver them to theindustrial centres so that industrial development can begin. 
We must concentrate all our efforts on this task. 
 It is inad-missible to allow ourselves to be diverted from it to anyother practical task. 
 It has to be solved by military methods, with absolute ruthlessness and by the absolute suppression of all other interests. 
 We know that a whole number of per-fectly legitimate demands and interests will go by the board,but if it were not for these sacrifices, we should not havewon the war. 
 The situation now demands that we makea sharp and swift turn towards the creation of a basis for peaceful economic development. 
 This basis must be the acquisition of great stocks of food and their transportationto the central region; it is the task of the railways to deliver raw materials and provisions. 
 From August 1917 to August 1918 we collected 30 million poods of grain, in the second year 110 million, and now in five months 90 million have been collected by our Commissariat of Food, collectedby socialist, not capitalist methods, by compulsory deliveryof grain by the peasants at fixed prices, and not by sellingon the free market—and this means that we have found theway. 
 We are certain that it is the correct way and that it will enable us to achieve results which will ensure tremen-dous economic development. 
 All our forces must be dedicated to this task, all our military forces, which came to the fore in war-time organ-isation, must be switched on to this new path. 
 This is thespecific situation, the specific transition, which engendered the idea of labour armies and led to the law on the creation of the first labour army in the Urals and of the Ukrainianlabour army. 
 It was followed by the law on the utilisationof the army reserves for civilian labour and the decreeissued by the Soviet government on the Committees forLabour Conscription. 
 105 All these laws will be outlined to you by a member of the All-Russia Central Executive Com-mittee in a fully detailed report. 
 I naturally cannot trespasson this ground because the special report will throw suffi-cient light upon it. 
 I only emphasise its significance in re-lation to our general policy, the significance of this transi-tion which confronts us with its specific tasks, for which we must redouble our efforts like soldiers, to organise them so that we can lay in large stocks of food and deliver them tothe industrial centres. 
 To achieve this we must at all costscreate labour armies, organise ourselves like an army,reduce, even close down a whole number of institutions sothat in the next few months, no matter what happens, we can overcome transport dislocation, and emerge from this desperate situation of cold, famine and impoverishmentbrought by the end of winter. 
 We must and can get out ofthis situation. 
 When the All-Russia Central ExecutiveCommittee endorses all the measures connected with labourconscription and the labour armies, when it has succeeded in instilling these ideas in the broad mass of the population and demands that they be put into practice by local offi-cials—we are absolutely convinced that then we shall be able to cope with this most difficult of tasks, while not in the least degree weakening our military readiness. 
 We must at all costs, without weakening our military readiness, switch the Soviet Republic on to the new courseof economic development. 
 This task must be accomplishedin the next few weeks, possibly months. 
 Every Soviet orParty organisation must do everything in its power to endthe transport dislocation and increase the grain stocks. 
 Then, and only then, shall we have a basis, a sound basis for industrial development on a wide scale, for the elec-trification of Russia. 
 In order to prove to the population,and in particular to the peasants, that our extensive plansin this field are not fantasies, but are borne out by and basedon technology and science, I think we should adopt a reso-lution—I hope the Central Executive Committee will en-dorse it—recommending that the Supreme Economic Coun-cil and the Commissariat of Agriculture jointly draft a planfor the electrification of Russia. 
 Thanks to the aid of the State Publishing House and the energy of the workers at the former Kushnerev Printing Works, now the 17th State Printing Works, I succeeded in getting Krzhizhanovsky’s pamphlet The Main Tasks of the Electrification of Russia published at very short notice, and tomorrow it will be distributed to all members of theAll-Russia Central Executive Committee. 
 This pamphlet ofComrade Krzhizhanovsky’s, who works in the Electro-Technical Sub-Department of the Supreme Economic Council, summarises what has already been achieved andraises questions, the popularisation of which, not the prac-tical application, is now one of the most important tasks. 
 I hope that the Central Executive Committee will adopt this resolution which, in the name of the Central Executive Committee, instructs the Supreme Economic Council and the People’s Commissariat of Agriculture to work out inthe course of the next few months—our practical tasksduring this period will be different—with the aid of scien-tists and engineers a broad and complete plan for the elec-trification of Russia. 
 The author of this pamphlet is abso-lutely correct in choosing as its motto the saying: “The age of steam is the age of the bourgeoisie, the age of electricityis the age of socialism. 
” We must have a new technical foun-dation for the new economic development. 
 This new techni-cal foundation is electricity, and everything will have to be built on this foundation, but it will take many long years. 
 We shall not be afraid of working ten or twenty years,but we must prove to the peasants that in place of the oldseparation of industry from agriculture, this very deepcontradiction on which capitalism thrived and which soweddissension between the industrial and agricultural workers, we set ourselves the task of returning to the peasant the loan we received from him in the form of grain, for we knowthat paper money, of course, is not the equivalent of bread. 
We must repay this loan by organising industry and sup-plying the peasants with its products. 
 We must show the peas-ants that the organisation of industry on the basis of modern, advanced technology, on electrification which will provide a link between town and country, will put an endto the division between town and country, will make itpossible to raise the level of culture in the countryside andto overcome, even in the most remote corners of the land,backwardness, ignorance, poverty, disease and barbarism. 
 We shall tackle the problem as soon as we have dealt with our current, basic task, and we shall not allow ourselves tobe deflected for a single moment from the fundamentalpractical task. 
 In the next few months all our energies must be concen-trated on food deliveries and the extension of our resources of food supplies. 
 There must not be the slightest departure from this. 
 At the same time let the scientists and techni-cians produce a long-term plan for the electrification of allRussia. 
 106 Let the links which we have established with the outside world, with capitalist Europe, that gatewaywhich we made for ourselves by concluding peace with Estonia, serve to provide us immediately with essential technical aid. 
 When, in the next few months, we have solvedthe basic problems of transport and foods supplies, whenwe have solved the problem of labour conscription, on whichproblems we shall wholly concentrate all our energies, notallowing ourselves to be deflected from this by anything else for a few months—when we have accomplished this we shall prove that we can go on with developmental tasksthat will last many years and put the whole of Russia on to an advanced technological footing, abolishing the division between town and country, and making it possible to con-quer completely and decisively the backwardness of the countryside, its scattered economy and its ignorance, fromwhich stem all the stagnation, all the backwardness, allthe oppression that have existed up to now. 
 And in thismatter, that of the peaceful struggle on the bloodless frontof the reorganisation of industry, we shall, if we employ all our military skill and all our energy, and concentrate all our forces on the fulfilment of this task, achieve successthat will be even more decisive, even more glorious, thanthose we have won in the military field.

’S REPLY TO THE LETTER OF THE INDEPENDENT SOCI AL-DEMOCRATI C PARTY OF GERMAN Y107 Having at last received an official proposal from the Independents (German) to conduct negotiations we, as a party, must now answer them with complete frankness,without the diplomacy that is, to a certain extent, oblig-atory for the Communist International. 
 The answer must be such as will explain the issue to the masses of workers who sympathise with the dictatorshipof the proletariat and the Soviet system—workers that notonly in Germany, but also in France and Britain and anumber of other countries, are being deceived (deliberately and unwittingly, i. 
e. 
, by force of self-deception) by leaders who in words alone subscribe to the slogans that are popular among the workers (dictatorship of the proletariat and So-viet power) but are actually conducting their work, propa-ganda, agitation, etc. 
, in the old way, not in the spirit ofthese slogans but in a spirit that contradicts theseslogans. 
 The following is a rough draft of the theses for this answer (from the R. 
C. 
P. 
 to the German Independent Social-Demo-cratic Party): (the sequence of the points must also be changed) 1. 
 The dictatorship of the proletariat implies the ability, readiness and determination to attract to our side (to the side of the revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat) the entire mass of working and exploited people by means ofrevolutionary measures, by expropriating the exploiters. 
 There is nothing of this in the day-to-day agitation of the German Independents (in Freiheit ,108 for instance). 
 Nor do the Longuetists have anything of it. 
 2. 
 In particular, such agitation is especially necessary for rural proletarians and semi-proletarians and also forsmall peasants (peasants who do not employ hired laboureven at the height of the harvest, etc. 
, peasants who sell lit-tle or no grain). 
 These sections of the population must have explained to them daily, popularly, with extreme simplic-ity and concreteness that when the proletariat has seizedstate power, it will give them an immediate improvement in their conditions by expropriating the landowners . 
 It will deliver them from the yoke of the big landowners, will handover big estates to them in their entirety, will free them from debt, etc. 
, etc. 
 The same applies to the urban non-proletarian, or not fully proletarian, mass of working people. 
 The German Independents (like the Longuetists) do not carry on such agitation. 
 3. 
 The Soviet system is the destruction of that bourgeois falsehood known as “freedom of the press”—i. 
e. 
, freedom to bribe the press, freedom for the rich, the capitalists, to buy up newspapers, freedom for the capitalists to buy uphundreds of newspapers and in this way fabricate theso-called public opinion. 
 The German Independents (when speaking of them it is always to be understood that the Longuetists, the British Independents, etc. 
, etc. 
, are included) do not admit this truth, do not spread it, do not agitate daily for the abolitionby revolutionary means of the enslavement by capital of thepress which bourgeois democrats falsely call freedom ofthe press. 
 The Independents do not carry on any such agitation and recognise Soviet power by way of lip-service alone ( Lippen-bekenntniss ); in actual fact they are fully weighed down by the prejudices of bourgeois democracy. 
 They cannot explain the main thing , the expropriation of the printing works and warehouses and the supplies ofpaper, because they do not understand it. 
 4. 
 The same applies to freedom of assembly (which is a falsehood as long as the rich own the best buildings andbuy up public buildings), to “arming of the people ”, to freedom of conscience ( =freedom for capital to buy or bribe whole church organisations for the purpose of doping the masses with the opium of religion), and to all other bour-geois-democratic liberties. 
 5. 
 The dictatorship of the proletariat means the over-throw of the bourgeoisie by a single class, the proletariat, and by its revolutionary vanguard at that. 
 To demand thatthis vanguard should first ensure the support of the majori-ty of the people through elections to bourgeois parliaments, bourgeois constituent assemblies, etc. 
, i. 
e. 
, by electionsheld while wage-slavery still exists , while the exploiters exist and exercise their oppression, and while the meansof production are privately owned—to demand this or toassume it is actually abandoning the standpoint of the dic-tatorship of the proletariat and going over to the standpoint of bourgeois democracy. 
 That is how the German Independents and the French Longuetists act. 
 These parties’ repetition of the petty-bour-geois democrats’ phrases about the majority of the “people”(deceived by the bourgeoisie and crushed by capital) places them objectively on the side of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat. 
 6. 
 The dictatorship of the proletariat implies and sig-nifies a clear concept of the truth that the proletariat,because of its objective economic position in every capital-ist society, correctly expresses the interests of the entire mass of working and exploited people, all semi-proletarians (i. 
e. 
, those who live partly by the sale of their labour-power), all small peasants and similar categories. 
 These sections do not follow the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties (including the “socialist” parties of theSecond International) by the free expression of their will (as petty-bourgeois democrats assume) but because they are directly deceived by the bourgeoisie, because of pressureby capital and because of the self-deception of the petty-bourgeois leaders. 
 The proletariat will attract these sections of the popula-tion (semi-proletarians and small peasants) to its side, and can attract them to its side, only after it has achieved a victory, only after it has won state power, that is, after theproletariat has overthrown the bourgeoisie, and emancipated all working people from the yoke of capital and shown them in practice the benefits (the benefits of freedom from the exploiters) accruing from proletarian state power. 
 This is the concept that constitutes the basis and essence of the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat; the GermanIndependents and French Longuetists do not understandit, do not spread it among the masses and do not propagan-dise it daily. 
 7. 
 The dictatorship of the proletariat implies a recog-nition of the necessity to suppress the resistance of the ex-ploiters by force, and the readiness, ability and determina-tion to do it. 
 The bourgeoisie, even the most republicanand democratic bourgeoisie (for instance, in Germany, Switz-erland and the U. 
S. 
A. 
), have regular recourse to pogroms, lynching, assassination, armed violence and terror against Communists and actually against all revolutionary stepstaken by the proletariat; to reject force or terror under suchcircumstances is tantamount to turning into a snivellingpetty bourgeois, to spreading reactionary petty-bourgeoisillusions about social peace and, to put it concretely, is tantamount to fear of the belligerent army officer. 
 The most criminal and most reactionary imperialist war of 1914-18 trained many tens of thousands of reactionaryofficers and pushed them into the forefront of politics in allcountries, even the most democratic republics; these offic-ers prepare and effect acts of terror for the benefit of the bourgeoisie, for the benefit of capital against the proleta-riat. 
 The attitude to terror displayed by the German Independ-ents and the French Longuetists in their parliamentaryspeeches, in newspaper articles and in all their propagandaand agitation is nothing less than the complete rejection of the real dictatorship of the proletariat, is an actual change-over to the position of the petty-bourgeois democrat andis corrupting the revolutionary consciousness of the workers. 
 8. 
 The same is true of civil war. 
 Following the imperial-ist war, when we are confronted with reactionary generals and officers who employ terror against the proletariat, when we are confronted with the fact that the present policy ofall bourgeois states is the preparation of fresh imperialist wars—wars are not only being deliberately prepared but are objectively inevitable as a result of all their politics— under these conditions, in such circumstances to bemoan a civil war against the exploiters, to condemn it and to fearit is tantamount to becoming a reactionary. 
 It means fearing the victory of the workers that may pos-sibly cost tens of thousands of lives and allowing for certainanother imperialist bloodbath that yesterday cost millions of lives and will tomorrow cost millions more. 
 It means giving real encouragement to the reactionary and rapacious tendencies, schemes and preparations of thebourgeois generals and officers. 
 Such is the reactionary nature of the sugary, petty-bour-geois, sentimental position of the German Independents and the French Longuetists in the question of the civil war. 
 They close their eyes to the intrigues of the White Guard andto its training and formation by the bourgeoisie and hypo-critically, pharisaically (or cowardly) turn their backs onwork to create a Red Guard, a proletarian Red Army that iscapable of crushing the resistance of the exploiters. 
 9. 
 The dictatorship of the proletariat and Soviet power imply a clear notion of the need to break , to smash to smith-ereens the bourgeois (even if it is republican-democratic)state machinery, the courts, the bureaucracy, both civiland military, etc. 
 The German Independents and the French Longuetists do not display any consciousness of this truth, nor do they carry on day-to-day agitation on behalf of it. 
 Worse even—they conduct all their agitation in the contrary spirit. 
 10. 
 Every revolution (as distinguished from a reform) by its very nature implies a crisis, and a very deep crisisat that, both political and economic. 
 This is irrespective of the crisis brought about by the war. 
 It is the task of the revolutionary party of the proletar-iat to explain to the workers and peasants that they musthave the courage to meet this crisis boldly and find in revo-lutionary measures a source of strength with which to over-come the crisis. 
 Only by surmounting the greatest crises with revolutionary enthusiasm, with revolutionary energy, with revolutionary preparedness to make the greatest sac-rifices, can the proletariat defeat the exploiters and liberate mankind entirely from wars, the oppression of cap-ital and wage-slavery. 
 There is no other way, because the reformist attitude to capitalism yesterday engendered the imperialist bloodbath(and will certainly-do the same tomorrow) involving millionsof people and endless crises. 
 This is the main idea without which the dictatorship of the proletariat is an empty phrase; the Independents and the Longuetists do not understand it and do not include it in their agitation and propaganda, do not explain it to themasses. 
 11. 
 The Independents and the Longuetists do not develop and do not make more profound the consciousness of themasses that the reformism that factually dominated in the Second International (1889-1914) and destroyed it was de-cadent and ruinous; on the contrary they dull that conscious-ness, they hide the disease and do not reveal it, do notexpose it. 
 12. 
 On leaving the Second International and condemning it verbally (in Crispien’s pamphlet, for instance) the Inde-pendents actually held out a hand to Friedrich Adler, a mem-ber of the Austrian party of the Noskes and Scheidemanns. 
 The Independents tolerate among their number writers who completely reject the basic concepts of the dictatorshipof the proletariat. 
 This divergence of word and deed is typical of the entire policy of the leaders of the Independent Party in Germany and of the Longuetists in France. 
 It is precisely the leaderswho share the prejudices of the petty-bourgeois democratsand of the upper stratum of the proletariat that has beencorrupted by reformism, contrary to the revolutionarysympathies of the masses of workers who gravitate towards the Soviet system. 
 13. 
 The Independents and the Longuetists do not under-stand and do not explain to the masses that the imperialistsuperprofits of the advanced countries enabled them (andstill enable them) to bribe the top stratum of the proletariat, to throw them some crumbs from the superprofits (obtained from the colonies and from the financial exploitation of weak countries), to create a privileged section of skilledworkers, etc. 
 Without the exposure of this evil, without a struggle against both the trade union bureaucracy and all manifesta-tions of petty-bourgeois guildism, against the working-class aristocracy, the privileges of the upper stratum of workers,without the ruthless removal from the revolutionary partyof those imbued with this spirit, without an appeal to thelower strata , to ever wider sections of the masses , to the real majority of the exploited—without all this there can be no question of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 14. 
 This unwillingness or inability to break with the top stratum of workers who are infected with imperialism,is also found among the Independents and the Longuetistsin their not conducting agitation for the direct, unqualifiedsupport for all insurrections and revolutionary movements of colonial peoples. 
 Under such circumstances the condemnation of colonial policy and of imperialism is either sheer hypocrisy or theempty sighing of a stupid philistine. 
 15. 
 The Independents and Longuetists do not carry on agitation among the troops (that they join the forces for the purpose of preparing their going over to the side of the workers against the bourgeoisie). 
 They do not create organ-isations for this work. 
 They do not respond to the violence of the bourgeoisie, to their endless contraventions of “legality” (both during the imperialist war and after it) using for this the regular propaganda of illegal organisations and creating such organ-isations. 
 Unless there is a combination of legal and illegal work, of legal and illegal organisations, there can be no questionof a truly revolutionary party of the proletariat in Germany,in Switzerland, in Britain, in France or in the U. 
S. 
A. 
 16. 
 By and large, all propaganda and agitation, all organisational work of the Independents and the Longuetistsis more petty-bourgeois-democratic than revolutionary-proletarian—it is pacifist and not social-revolutionary. 
 In view of this the “recognition” of the dictatorship of the proletariat and of Soviet power remains purely verbal. 
 Summary. 
 In the prevailing situation the R.

P. 
 deems the only correct solution to be not to unite with the Inde-pendents and the Longuetists in one International, but to bide our time until the revolutionary masses of the French and German workers correct the weakness, errors, preju-dices and inconsistencies of such parties as the Independentsand the Longuetists. 
 In the opinion of the R.

 I. 
 Lenin, greeted with stormy applause, delivered a long speech. 
 “The most outstanding fact in the world situation,” said Comrade Lenin, “is the peace with Estonia. 
 This peace is a window into Europe. 
 It opens up before us the possi-bility of beginning an exchange of goods with the West. 
 Our enemies maintained that the revolution in the West isfar away and that we would not be able to hold out withoutit. 
 We have not only held out, however, we have won a vic-tory. 
 “We won without obtaining a single cartridge from any-where, we won only because the workers and Red Army sol-diers know what they are fighting for. 
 “If the small nations that are playthings in the hands of the Entente begin to wish for peace with Soviet Russia,this is to be explained by our having shown in practice howthe imperialists have deceived them and how gladly the Russian proletariat extends to them the hand of peace. 
 Poland will follow Estonia. 
 Information has been receivedthat Soviet Russia’s peace proposals will be discussed inPoland. 
 This bloodless victory is of tremendous importance. 
” Lenin went over to the internal situation and showed that it boiled down to a struggle against chaos on the rail-ways. 
 Railway transport was hanging by a hair. 
 If the trains stopped running that would mean the end of the proletar-ian centres. 
 Heroic efforts on the part of the masses of workers would be needed to maintain transport and facili-tate the struggle against hunger and cold. 
 Unparalleled heroism proved possible during the Civil War which claimed so many victims, and that heroism and those sacrificesthat decided the war in our favour were still essential nowthat the war had shifted to another front, the industrialfront. 
 Victory was now essential on this bloodless front. 
 “It must be understood that sacrifices are also needed here,” continued the speaker. 
 “Sacrifices must be made to restore the country’s economy. 
 ‘Victory or Death’ must be-come the slogan on the industrial front. 
 It is necessary forworkers to be conscious of the need for the tensest strugglefor victory on this front. 
 There is a hard struggle ahead andit will have to be carried on by tired and hungry workers; if, however, they realise that the fate of the working class depends on the outcome of this struggle, they will win out. 
” The question of transport was being discussed by the Council of Defence, but the workers themselves would haveto muster for the struggle against the transport chaos andthe profiteering that intensified the chaos. 
 Those who did not give their grain surpluses to the state were turning the railways into an instrument for profiteering, they wereenemies, and politically-conscious workers should musterfor the struggle against them. 
 “We led the Red Army to victory by strict, iron disci-pline as well as agitation. 
 What has been organised in the Red Army must also be created on all the fronts of labour. 
 The entire experience of the creation of the Red Army mustbe transferred to the army of railway workers so that it canrise to the same heights as the Red Army. 
 Without sacrifice,without iron discipline, without the employment of special-ists the Red Army would not have been victorious, and with-out them the railway army will not be victorious.

 28, Published according to February 7, 1920 the Petrogradskaya Pravda text À LA GUERRE COMME À LA GUERRE ! The landowners and capitalists, who have been over-thrown by the workers and peasants of Russia, have forcedtwo years of civil war upon us with the help of the capital-ists of the whole world. 
 We are ending this war victoriously. 
We have already gained the first peace, which has demon-strated the superiority of our foreign policy over the pol-icy of the united capitalists of all countries. 
 These cap-italists did their utmost to prevent peace between Estonia and us. 
 We have beaten them. 
 We have concluded peace with Estonia—the first peace; it will be followed by others,opening up for us the possibility of trading with Europe andAmerica. 
 The bloody war which the exploiters forced upon us we are ending victoriously. 
 During these two years we have learned how to win; and we have won. 
 Now comes the turn of a bloodless war. 
Let us work for victory on the front of the bloodless war against hunger and cold, against typhus and destruction,against ignorance and economic chaos! This bloodless war has been forced upon us by the de-struction caused by four years of imperialist war and two years of civil war. 
 In order to defeat the poverty and want,the hunger and hardships caused by these wars, we must keepfirmly in mind, must thoroughly grasp and everywhere andat all costs observe the maxim, à la guerre comme à la guerre! The workers and peasants were able to create a Red Army without the landowners and capitalists and against them, andwere able to defeat the exploiters. 
 The workers and peasants will be able to create Red armies of peaceful labour—they will be able to win new happiness for themselves by restoring agriculture and in-dustry. 
 The first and chief step towards this is the restoration of the transport system which must be done at all costs, immedi-ately, with revolutionary energy, and must be carried outwith military determination, solidarity, speed and selfless devotion. 
 Let’s get on with the job, comrades!Let us show that in the sphere of peaceful labour we can display even greater marvels of heroism and victory than inthe arena of war against the exploiters! February 7, 1920 Pravda No.

 Lenin SPEECH DELIVERED AT A NON -PARTY CONFERENCE IN BLAGUSHA -LEFORTOVO DISTRICT FEBRUARY 9, 1920 NEWSPAPER REPORT In his speech Lenin dealt with two burning questions of present-day Soviet life—the international situation and thelabour front. 
 “By its victories,” Lenin said, “our Red Army has consol-idated the position of Soviet Russia and has secured for us the first victory over the Entente imperialists. 
 How is this victory to be explained? It is clear that it was not achievedby the victories at the front alone, but by our having wonover the soldiers of the countries warring against us. 
 TheAllies corrupted their own armies by landing troops in ourcountry and were soon forced to withdraw them. 
 The sol-diers refused to fight us. 
 The very expression ‘Soviet gov-ernment,’ that is, a government of the working people,brings joy to the hearts of the proletarians all over theworld. 
 “By means of agitation and propaganda, we deprived the Entente of its own troops. 
 We defeated the imperialists not only with the aid of our soldiers, but also by relying on the sympathy the Entente soldiers felt for us. 
 On the otherhand, we gave a practical demonstration to the small neigh-bouring states that our policy is a peaceful one. 
 Britain,through its mouthpiece, Churchill, threatened to send four-teen states against us; but this campaign collapsed when concurrently with our victories, we kept making proposals for peace. 
 We proposed peace to Estonia without insisting onany particular frontiers, knowing only that we did not want to shed the blood of workers and peasants for the sake of any frontiers. 
 “The removal of the blockade is exclusively to be attrib-uted to the sympathy which Soviet power inspires amongthe workers of the hostile countries. 
 In Italy, matters havegone so far that a congress of socialist parties has unanimouslyadopted a resolution demanding the raising of the blockadeof Soviet Russia and the resumption of trade relations. 
 Although they do not love the Bolsheviks, the bourgeois gov-ernments of the small countries have become convinced thatthe Bolsheviks want to live on good-neighbourly terms withthem, whereas those on whose side General Denikin or anyother general is, would tear up all the scraps of paper prom-ising independence to the small nations immediately after gaining victory. 
 Without a single gun, without a single machine-gun, without firing a single shot, we have concludedpeace; we have laid the foundation for the conclusion of peacewith all the countries that are waging war on us. 
 We haveshown that all governments have to lay down their arms inface of the peace policy of the Soviet government. 
 “We have already cut a window opening on to Europe, and we shall try to make wide use of it. 
 Attempts are beingmade to incite Poland against us. 
 But these attempts willfail, and the time is not far off when we shall conclude peacewith all of them, although they say that they will not recog-nise us. 
 They are mortally afraid of the spread of the Bolshevik infection at home; but although they have surrounded themselves with a Chinese Wall the Bol-shevik infection already exists in each of these countries,it lurks in their midst. 
 This infection was brought by theFrench and British soldiers who had been to Soviet Russiaand had breathed her air. 
 We have thus gained two victories. 
 We have smashed the whiteguard hordes on all fronts, and we are winning peace on a world scale, winning it not withguns, but by the sympathy we have been able to inspire notonly in the workers but even in the bourgeois governments ofthe small nationalities. 
” Lenin then went on to deal briefly with the labour front. 
 “Comrades,” he said, “spring is approaching; we have been through an extraordinarily difficult winter of cold, hunger,typhus and railway chaos. 
 We must be victorious on this front too. 
 Just as we were able to sacrifice everything during the war and to give our best forces—the advanced workers, Communists and political and military students died in the front ranks and thus raised the morale of the wholearmy—so now we say that we must win on the front of eco-nomic chaos, the Communists and the advanced workers,the most honest and conscientious, the finest and staunch-est, must be in the forefront, as they were then; every train, every locomotive must be won by struggle, must be fought for. 
 That is my appeal to the non-party conference. 
 “Comrades, before concluding my speech I would like to say a few words about the measures decided on at the lastsession of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. 
 Thesession decided on a number of measures which will shortly be published in the newspapers, and which should be read and discussed at all meetings of workers, in clubs, factoriesand Red Army units. 
 One of the most important decisionsof the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, one to whichin my opinion the most profound attention should be di-rected, concerns the fight against red tape in our institutions. 
 One of the measures is the decision of the All-Russia Cen-tral Executive Committee to transform our state control intoa workers’ and peasants’ control, or a workers’ inspection. 
 110 We shall not drive out the old officials—just as we did notdrive the experts out of the army, but attached worker com-missars to them—we must attach groups of workers to these bourgeois experts, to look on, to learn and to take this work into their own hands. 
 Workers must enter all the govern-ment establishments so as to supervise the entire governmentapparatus. 
 And this should be done by the non-party work-ers, who should elect their representatives at non-partyconferences of workers and peasants. 
 They must come to the assistance of the Communists who are being overtaxed by the tremendous burden they have to bear. 
 We must pour asmany workers and peasants as possible into this apparatus. 
We shall tackle this job and accomplish it, and thus drivered tape out of our institutions. 
 The broad non-party massesmust keep a check on all government affairs, and must themselves learn to govern. 
” Pravda No. 
 32, Published according to February 13, 1920 the Pravda text A PUBLICIS T’S NOTES Citizen Jean Longuet has sent me a letter consisting mainly of the same complaints as those contained in his ar-ticle, “How Are the Russians Deceived?” (Populair e,111 January 10, 1920. 
) Longuet has also sent me this issue of his newspaper together with a leaflet of the Committee for the Reconstruction of the International (Comité pour la reconstruction de l’Internationale )112. 
 The leaflet contains two draft resolutions for the forthcoming congress of the French Socialist Part y113 in Strasbourg. 
 It is signed on be-half of the Committee for the Reconstruction of the Inter-national by 24 persons: Amédée Dunois, Citizeness Fanny Clar, Caussy, Maurice Delépine, Paul Faure, Ludovic-Oscar Frossard, Eugène Frot, Henri Gourdeaux, Citizeness Leyciagnre, André Le Troquer, Paul Louis, Jean Longuet, Maurice Maurin, Barthélemy Mayéras, Joan Mouret, Geor-ges Mauranges, Palicot, Pécher, Citizeness Marianne Rauze, Daniel Renault, Servantier, Sixte Quenin, Tommasi, Raoul Verfeuil. 
 It seems to me superfluous to reply to Jean Longuet’s complaints and attacks: adequate replies have been given in F. 
 Loriot’s article in Vie Ouvrièr e114 of January 16, 1920, entitled “Gently, Longuet!” (“Tout doux, Longuet!”), and in Trotsky’s article in the Communist Internationa l115 No. 
 7-8, entitled “Jean Longuet”. 
 Very little remains to be added; perhaps only that it would be a good thing to collect material for a history of the failure of the strike of July 21, 1919 . 
116 But I cannot do this from Moscow. 
 All I have seen is a quotation from Avanti !117 published in an AustrianI Communist paper, exposing the despicable role played in this affair by one of the most despicable of the social-traitors (or anarcho-traitors?), the former syndicalist and anti-parliamentary windbag, Jouhaux. 
 Why should notLonguet give somebody the job, which can be easily done inParis, of collecting all the documents, all the comments andarticles in the European Communist papers, and all thespecial interviews with the leaders and participants con-cerned, on the failure of the strike of July 21, 1919? We would be delighted to publish such a work. 
 The “socialist education”about which the “Centrists” of the whole world (the Independ-ents in Germany, the Longuetists in France, the I. 
L. 
P. 
 118 in Britain, etc. 
) talk so often and so readily must be under-stood to mean the firm exposure of the mistakes of the leaders and the mistakes of the movement and not the pedantic and doctrinaire repetition of general socialist phrases, whicheverybody is tired of hearing and which, since 1914-18,nobody trusts. 
 An example of this—all the leaders and all the promi-nent members of the socialist parties, the trade unions and the workers’ co-operative societies who advocated the “defence of the fatherland” in the war of 1914-18, acted astraitors to socialism. 
 The real work of “socialist education”implies the persistent exposure of their mistake, the syste-matic explanation that this war was, in respect of both sides, a war between bandits for the division of the spoils, and that a repetition of such a war is inevitable unless the prole-tariat overthrows the bourgeoisie by revolutionary means. 
 The resolutions I have referred to speak about such work of education, but what is actually being done is a work ofsocialist corruption, for treason, treachery, routine, iner-tia, careerism, philistinism and mistakes are hushed up, whereas real education consists in overcoming and removing them. 
 II Neither of the resolutions of the Longuetists is of any use—although, incidentally, they are very useful in one particular sphere, that of showing what, at the present mo-ment, is perhaps the most dangerous evil for the working-class movement in the West. 
 The evil is this: the old leaders, observing what an irresistible attraction Bolshevism and Soviet government have for the masses, are seeking ( and often finding! ) a way of escape in the verbal recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat and Soviet government,although they actually either remain enemies of the dicta-torship of the proletariat, or are unable or unwilling tounderstand its significance and to carry it into effect. 
 The fall of the first Soviet Republic in Hungary (the first, which fell, will be followed by a second, which willbe victorious) shows clearly how vast, how immense is thedanger of this evil. 
 A number of articles in the Vienna Rote Fahne , 119 the Central Organ of the Austrian Communist Party, have revealed one of the chief reasons for its fall, namely, the treachery of the “socialists”, who went over to Béla Kun120 verbally and proclaimed themselves Commu-nists, but who actually did not pursue a policy consonantwith the dictatorship of the proletariat; they vacillated,played the coward, made advances to the bourgeoisie, and inpart directly sabotaged and betrayed the proletarian revo-lution. 
 Naturally, the powerful brigands of imperialism (i. 
e. 
, the bourgeois governments of Britain, France, etc. 
)that surrounded the Hungarian Soviet Republic made gooduse of these vacillations within the Hungarian Soviet govern-ment and used the Rumanian butchers to crush it. 
 There can be no doubt that some of the Hungarian social-ists went over to Béla Kun sincerely , and sincerely proclaimed themselves Communists. 
 But that changes nothing essen-tial: a man who “sincerely” proclaims himself a Communist,but who in practice vacillates and plays the coward insteadof pursuing a ruthlessly firm, unswervingly determined andsupremely courageous and heroic policy (and only such a policy is consonant with recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat)—such a man, in his weakness of character,vacillations and irresolution, is just as much guilty oftreachery as a direct traitor. 
 As far as the individual isconcerned, there is a very great difference between a manwhose weakness of character makes him a traitor and one who is a deliberate, calculating traitor; but in politics there is no such difference, because politics involves the actualfate of millions of people, and it makes no difference whether the millions of workers and poor peasants are betrayed by those who are traitors from weakness of character or by those whose treachery pursues selfish aims. 
 We cannot yet say which of the Longuetists who signed the resolutions we are discussing will prove to belong tothe first category, which to the second and which to somethird, and it would be idle to speculate on it. 
 The importantthing is that these Longuetists, as a political trend , are now pursuing exactly the same policy as the Hungarian “social-ists” and “Social-Democrats” who brought about the fallof the Soviet government in Hungary. 
 It is precisely thispolicy that the Longuetists are pursuing, for verbally theyproclaim themselves supporters of the dictatorship ofthe proletariat and Soviet government, but actually they con-tinue to behave in the old way and to defend in their resolu-tions and to carry out in practice the old policy of pettyconcessions to social-chauvinism, opportunism and bour-geois democracy, the policy of vacillation, irresolution,evasiveness, subterfuge, suppression of facts, and the like. 
In their totality, these petty concessions, this vacillation, irresolution, evasiveness, subterfuge and suppression of facts inevitably constitute a betrayal of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 Dictatorship is a big, harsh and bloody word, one which expresses a relentless life-and-death struggle between twoclasses, two worlds, two historical epochs. 
 Such words must not be uttered frivolously. 
 To place the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat on the order of the day, and at the same timeto “fear to offend” men like Albert Thomas, the BrackesSembats and the other champions of the vilest French so-cial-chauvinism, the heroes of the traitor newspapers l’Humanité , La Bataille 121 and the like, is to betray the working class—be it from lack of thought, lack of understand-ing, weakness of character, or some other cause, it isnevertheless betrayal of the working class. 
 It was the divergence between word and deed that caused the collapse of the Second International. 
 The Third Inter-national is not yet a year old, but it is already becoming fashionable and is a lure to those politicians who go whereverthe masses go. 
 The Third International is already in danger of its word and deed diverging. 
 This danger must be exposed everywhere and at all costs, and every manifestation of this evil must be eradicated. 
 The resolutions of the Longuetists (like the resolutions of the recent congress of the German Independents, who areGerman Longuetists) have transformed “dictatorship of theproletariat” into just such an icon as the resolutions ofthe Second International used to be for the leaders, the officials of the trade unions, the parliamentarians and the functionaries of the co-operative societies. 
 An icon issomething you pray to, something you cross yourself before,something you bow down to; but an icon has no effect onpractical life and practical politics. 
 No, gentlemen, we shall not allow the slogan “dictator-ship of the proletariat” to be turned into an icon; we shall not consent to the Third International tolerating any diver-gence between word and deed. 
 If you stand for the dictatorship of the proletariat, then do not pursue that evasive, equivocal, compromising policytowards social-chauvinism which you are pursuing and which is expressed in the very first lines of your first reso-lution: the war, you see, “has rent” ( a déchirée ) the Second International, has severed it from the work of “socialisteducation” ( éducation socialiste ), while “certain sections of this International” ( certaines de ses fractions ) have “weak-ened themselves” by sharing power with the bourgeoisie, and so on and so forth. 
 That is not the language of people who consciously and sincerely support the idea of the dictatorship of theproletariat. 
 It is the language either of people who takeone step forward and two steps back, or of politicians. 
 Ifyou want to talk this language—or rather, as long as you talk this language, as long as this is your policy—stay in the Second International, where you belong. 
 Or let theworkers, whose mass pressure is pushing you towards theThird International, leave you behind in the Second Inter-national and themselves come over, without you , to the. 
 Third International. 
 On the same terms we shall say “Wel-come” to these workers, whether of the French Socialist Party, the German Independent Social-Democratic Party,or the British Independent Labour Party. 
 If you recognise the dictatorship of the proletariat, and at the same time talk about the war of 1914-18, then you must talk differently and say that this war was a war be-tween the brigands of Anglo-Franco-Russian imperialismand the brigands of Austro-German imperialism for thedivision of spoils, of colonies and “spheres” of financialinfluence. 
 Preaching “defence of the fatherland” in such a warwas treason to socialism. 
 If this truth is not thoroughly ex-plained, if this treason is not eradicated from the minds, hearts and policy of the workers, it will be impossible to escape the miseries of capitalism, it will be impossible to escape new wars, which are inevitable as long as capitalism persists. 
 You do not want to talk this language, you cannot talkthis language or carry on this propaganda, do you? You want to “spare” yourselves or your friends who yesterday preached the “defence of the fatherland” in Germany under Wilhelmor Noske and in Britain and France under the rule of thebourgeoisie, don’t you? Then spare the Third International! Gladden it with your absence! III I have so far spoken of the first of the two resolutions. 
 The second is no better: “solemn” (“ solennelle ”) condemnation of “confusionism”, and even of “all compromise” (“ toute compromission ”—this is an empty revolutionary phrase, because one cannot be opposed to all compromise), and, alongside of this, evasive, equivocal repetition of generalphrases—phrases which do not explain the concept “dicta-torship of the proletariat” but obscure it—attacks upon the“policy of M. 
 Clemenceau” (the usual trick of bourgeois pol-iticians in France, who represent a change of cliques to be a change of regime), and the exposition of a programme whichis fundamentally reformist —taxes, “nationalisation of the capitalist monopolies”, etc. 
 The Longuetists do not understand and do not want to understand (partly, are incapable of understanding) that re-formism, masked by revolutionary phrase-mongering, was the chief evil of the Second International, the chief reason forits disgraceful collapse, for the support given by the “socialists” to the war in which ten million people were slaughtered in order to settle the great question whether the Anglo-Russo-French group or the German group of cap-italist depredators should plunder the world. 
 The Longuetists have in fact remained the reformists they were, masking their reformism by revolutionary phrasesand employing the new tag “dictatorship of the proletariat”merely as a revolutionary phrase. 
 The proletariat does not need such leaders, nor does it need the leaders of the German Independent Social-Democratic Party, or the leaders of theBritish Independent Labour Party. 
 The proletariat cannotbring about its dictatorship with such leaders. 
 Recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat does not mean undertaking an assault, an uprising, at all costs and at any moment. 
 That is nonsense. 
 A successful insurrec-tion demands prolonged, skilful and persistent preparations,preparations entailing great sacrifice. 
 Recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat means making a determined, relentless, and, what is most important,a fully conscious and consistent break with the oppor-tunism, reformism, equivocation and evasiveness of the Second International—a break with the leaders who cannot help carrying on the old tradition, with the old (not in age, but in methods) parliamentarians, trade union and co-oper-ative society officials, etc. 
 A break with them is essential. 
 To pity them would be criminal; it would mean betraying the fundamental inter-ests of tens of millions of workers and small peasants for thepaltry interests of some ten thousand or hundred thou-sand people. 
 Recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat requires the fundamental reconstruction of the day-to-day work of the Party, it means getting among the millions of workers, agricultural labourers and small peasants whom only Soviets , the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, can save from the miseries of capitalism and war. 
 The dictatorship of theproletariat means explaining this concretely, simply, clearly,to the masses, to tens of millions of people; it means telling them that their Soviets must take over state power in its entirety , and that their vanguard, the party of the revolutionary proletariat, must lead the struggle. 
 The Longuetists have not the faintest inkling of this truth, nor have they the least desire or ability to give daily effect to it. 
 IV In Austria, communism has passed through an extremely difficult period, which it seems is not quite over yet—growing pains, the illusion that by proclaiming themselves Communists a group can become a force without waging a profound struggle for influence over the masses, and mis-takes in the cboice of people (mistakes that are inevitable at first in every revolution; we made a number of similar mistakes). 
 Die Rote Fahne , the daily organ of the Communists edited by Koritschoner and Tomann, shows that the movement is taking the right road. 
 And to what depths of stupidity, vileness and sordidness the Austrian Social-Democrats are sinking is only tooclearly shown by the whole policy of Renner and similarAustrian Scheidemanns, who are helped—partly out of utter stupidity and weakness of character—by the Otto Bauers and Friedrich Adlers, who have become rank traitors. 
 Take, for example, Otto Bauer’s pamphlet, The Path to Socialism . 
* I have before me a Berlin edition by Frei-heit —apparently the publishing house of the Independent Party, which is entirely on the same wretched, vulgar and despicable level as this pamphlet. 
 A glance at a couple of passages from §9 (“Expropria-tion of the Expropriators”) will be enough: “Expropriation cannot and must not take the form of the brutal [brutaler ] confiscation of the property of the capitalists and landowners; for in this form it could be accomplished only at the cost of a tremen-dous destruction of the productive forces, which would ruin the massesof the people themselves and would choke the sources of nationalincome. 
 On the contrary, the expropriation of the expropriators musttake place in a systematic and regular way” ... by means of taxation. 
 And this learned man goes on to illustrate how “four-ninths” of the income of the wealthy classes could be extracted by means of taxation.... 
 *Der Weg zum Sozialismus . 
—Ed. 
 Enough, is it not? As for myself, after these words (and I began reading the pamphlet from §9) I read nothing more; and I do not intend to read any more of Mr. 
 Otto Bauer’s pamphlet unless there is special need to. 
 For it isclear that this, the best of the social-traitors, is at most alearned and utterly hopeless fool. 
 He is a typical pedant, a thorough petty bourgeois at heart. 
 Before the war he wrote useful and learned books and articles in which he “theoretically” admitted that the class struggle might attain the acuteness of a civil war. 
 He evenhad a hand (if I am correctly informed) in drawing up theBasle Manifesto of 1912, which directly foretold a proletar-ian revolution in connection with that very war which actually broke out in 1914. 
 But when this proletarian revolution became a reality, the soul of the pedant and philistine got the upper hand,and he grew frightened and began to pour the oil of refor-mist phrase-mongering on the troubled waters of the revolu-tion . 
 He had got it firmly fixed in his mind (pedants cannot think, they can only commit to memory, learn by rote) that the expropriation of the expropriators without confis-cation is theoretically possible. 
 He was always repeating this. 
He had learned it by rote. 
 He knew it by heart in 1912. 
He repeated it from memory in 1919. 
 He cannot think. 
 After an imperialist war, a war which has brought even the victors to the verge of ruin, after civil war has broken out in a number of countries, afterfacts have proved on a world-wide scale the inevitability ofthe conversion of imperialist war into civil war, to preach,in the year of our Lord 1919, in the city of Vienna, the“systematic” and “regular” extraction from the capitalists of “four-ninths” of their income—to do this one must be either an imbecile or that old hero of grand old German poetrywho flitted rapturously “from book to book”.... 
 This dear old gentleman, no doubt a most virtuous pater-familias, a most honest citizen and most conscientiousreader and writer of learned works, has forgotten one tiny detail; he has forgotten that such a “systematic” and “regular” transition to socialism (the transition which undoubtedlywould be the most advantageous to “the people”, abstractly speaking) presumes an absolutely secure victory of the pro-letariat, the absolute hopelessness of the position of the capitalists, the absolute necessity for them to display the most scrupulous obedience and their readiness to do so. 
 Is such a conjunction of circumstances possible?Speaking theoretically, which in this case means speaking quite abstractly, it is possible, of course. 
 For example, letus assume that in nine countries, including all the Great Powers, the Wilsons, Lloyd Georges, Millerands, and other champions of capitalism are already in the same positionas Yudenich, Kolchak, Denikin, and their Ministers in ourcountry. 
 Let us assume that after this, in a tenth country, asmall country, the capitalists propose to the workers:“Look here, we will conscientiously help you, in obedience to your decisions, to carry out a ‘systematic’ and peaceful (without destruction!) ‘expropriation of the expropriators’,for which you will let us have five-ninths of our formerincome in the first year and four-ninths in the second year. 
” It is quite conceivable that under the circumstances I have mentioned the capitalists in the tenth country, one of the smallest and most “peaceful” countries, might make such a proposal, and there would be absolutely nothing wrongin the workers of this country discussing this proposal ina business-like way and (after bargaining a bit, for a mer-chant cannot help asking more than his wares are worth)accepting it. 
 Now, after this popular explanation, perhaps the thing will be clear even to the learned Otto Bauer and to thephilosopher Friedrich Adler (who is as successful a philos-opher as he is a politician). 
 No, not clear yet?Just think, dear Otto Bauer and dear Friedrich Adler, does the position of world capitalism and of its leaders at the present moment resemble that of Yudenich, Kolchak andDenikin in Russia? No, it does not. 
 In Russia the capitalists have been smashed, after having put up a most desperate resistance. 
In the rest of the world they are still in power. 
 They are the masters. 
 If, dear Otto Bauer and Friedrich Adler, it is not clear to you yet, let me add something in an even more popular form. 
 Just imagine that at the time when Yudenich stood at the gates of Petrograd, when Kolchak held the Urals and Denikin the whole of the Ukraine, and when the pockets of these three heroes were stuffed with telegrams from Wilson,Lloyd George, Millerand and Co. 
 informing them of the dis-patch of money, guns, officers and soldiers—just imaginethat at this moment a representative of the Russian workerswere to come to Yudenich, Kolchak or Denikin, and say: “We, the workers, are in the majority. 
 We will let you have five-ninths of your income, and later will take away therest as well, ‘systematically’ and peacefully. 
 Let’s shakehands on it! ‘Without destruction!’ Is it a go?” If this representative of the workers were simply clad, and if the Russian general, Denikin, for example, were alone when he received him, he would very likely commit the worker to a lunatic asylum, or just drive him away. 
 But if the representative of the workers were an intel-lectual wearing a decent suit of clothes, and, in addition,were the son of a respectable papa (like our good friendFriedrich Adler), and if, moreover, Denikin were not alone, but received him in the presence of a French or British “adviser”—this adviser would undoubtedly say to Denikin: “Look here, general, this representative of the workers is a sensible fellow. 
 He is just the man for one of our min-isterial jobs, like Henderson in Britain, Albert Thomas inFrance, and Otto Bauer and Friedrich Adler in Austria.

 My advice: (1) protect the coal that is ready and send reinforcements quickly to the Caucasian Front. 
 That ismost important of all; (2) protect the salt and let regimentsand squadrons occupy one volost after another in the vicin-ity of the Donets Basin and carry out requisitioning fully, awarding bread and salt to the poor; (3) immediately mobi-lise part of the Kharkov and Donets Basin workers for theFood Army to work together with the regiments andsquadrons; (4) the work of the Ukrainian Council of theLabour Army to be measured by the daily amount of grainand coal delivered and the number of locomotives repaired. 
 Lenin Written on February 18, 192 Published according to First published in 1942 the manuscript IN REPLY TO QUESTION S PUT BY KAR L WIEGAND, BERLI N CORRESPONDENT OF UNIVERSA L SERVIC E122 1. 
 Do we intend to attack Poland and Rumania? No. 
 We have declared most emphatically and officially, in the name of the Council of People’s Commissars and the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, our peacefulintentions. 
 It is very much to be regretted that the Frenchcapitalist government is instigating Poland (and presumably Rumania, too) to attack us. 
 This is even mentioned by a number of American radios from Lyons. 
 2. 
 What are our plans in Asia? They are the same as in Europe: peaceful coexistencewith all peoples; with the workers and peasants of all nations awakening to a new life—a life without exploiters, without landowners, without capitalists, without merchants. 
The imperialist war of 1914-18, the war of the capitalistsof the Anglo-French (and Russian) group against the German-Austrian capitalist group for the partition of the world,has awakened Asia and has strengthened there, as everywhere else, the urge towards freedom, towards peaceful labour and against possible future wars. 
 3. 
 What would be the basis of peace with America? Let the American capitalists leave us alone. 
 We shall not touch them. 
 We are even ready to pay them in gold for any machinery, tools, etc. 
, useful to our transport and industries We are ready to pay not only in gold, but in rawmaterials too. 
 4. 
 What are the obstacles to such a peace? None on our part; imperialism on the part of the Ameri-can (and of any other) capitalists. 
 5. 
 What are our views of the deportation of Russian revo-lutionaries from America? We have accepted them. 
 We are not afraid of revolution-aries here in this country. 
 As a matter of fact, we are not afraid of anybody, and if America is afraid of a few more hundred or thousand of its citizens, we are ready to beginnegotiations with a view of receiving any citizens whom Amer-ica thinks dangerous (with the exception of criminals, ofcourse). 
 6. 
 What possibilities are there of an economic alliance between Russia and Germany? Unfortunately, they are not great. 
 The Scheidemanns are bad allies. 
 We stand for an alliance with all countrieswithout exception. 
 7. 
 What are our views upon the allied demand for the extradition of war criminals? If we are to speak seriously on this matter of war guilt, the guilty ones are the capitalists of all countries. 
 Handover to us all your landed proprietors owning more than ahundred hectares and capitalists having a capital of more than 100,000 francs, and we shall educate them to useful labour and make them break with the shameful, base andbloody role of exploiters and instigators of wars for the par-tition of colonies. 
 Wars will then soon become absolutelyimpossible. 
 8. 
 What would be the influence of peace with Russia upon the economic conditions in Europe? Exchange of machinery for grain, flax and other raw materials—I ask, can this be disadvantageous for Europe?Clearly, it cannot be anything but beneficial. 
 9. 
 What is our opinion regarding the future development of the Soviets as a world force? The future belongs to the Soviet system all the world over. 
 The facts have proved it. 
 One has only to count by quarterly periods, say, the growth in the number of pamphlets, books, leaflets and newspapers standing for or sympathising withthe Soviets published in any country. 
 It cannot be other-wise. 
 Once the workers in the cities, the workers, landlesspeasants and the handicraftsmen in the villages as well asthe small peasants (i. 
e. 
, those who do not exploit hired labour)—once this enormous majority of working people have understood that the Soviet system gives all power intotheir hands, releasing them from the yoke of landlords andcapitalists—how could one prevent the victory of the Sovietsystem all over the world? I, for one, do not know of anymeans of preventing it. 
 10. 
 Has Russia still to fear counter-revolution from without? Unfortunately, it has, for the capitalists are stupid, greedy people. 
 They have made a number of such stupid, greedy attempts at intervention and one has to fear repe-titions until the workers and peasants of all countries thor-oughly re-educate their own capitalists. 
 11. 
 Is Russia ready to enter into business relations with America? Of course she is ready to do so, and with all other coun-tries. 
 Peace with Estonia, to whom we have conceded agreat deal, has proved our readiness, for the sake of businessrelations, to give even industrial concessions on certainconditions.

 What is our attitude towards the raising of the blockade? We consider it a big step forward. 
 The possibility is being opened for us to pass from a war that was forced on us by the capitalist governments of the Entente to peacefulreconstruction. 
 This is of the greatest importance to us. 
 Straining all our efforts towards the restoration of the economic life of the country, ruined first by the war be-tween capitalists over the Dardanelles and the colonies, thenby the war of the capitalists of the Entente and Russia againstthe workers of Russia, we are now, among other measures,working out, with the aid of a number of scientists and ex-perts, a plan of electrification of the whole country. 
 This plan is to be realised over a period of many years. 
 The elect-rification will rejuvenate Russia. 
 Electrification based onthe Soviet system will mean the complete success of the foun-dations of communism in our country—foundations of acultured life, without exploiters, without capitalists, with-out landlords, without merchants. 
 The raising of the blockade will help to accomplish Rus-sia’s electrification. 
 2. 
 What influence will the Allies’ decision to cease of-fensive action have on the offensive actions of the Soviet power? The Allies, together with their allies and their lackeys— Kolchak, Denikin, and the capitalists of the surroundingOF THE DAIL Y EXPRE SS countries—have attacked us. 
 We did not attack anyone. 
 We concluded peace with Estonia even at the cost of material sacrifices. 
 We are impatiently waiting to see the Allies’ “decision” supported by their deeds , but the story of the Versailles Peace and of its consequences, unfortunately, indicates thatin most cases the Allies’ words disagree with their deeds andthe decisions remain scraps of paper. 
 3. 
 Is the present status quo satisfactory from the stand-point of Soviet policy? Yes, because every status quo in politics is a transition from old forms to new ones. 
 The present status quo is, from many points of view, a transition from war to peace. 
 Such a change is desirable to us for this reason, and insofar do we consider the status quo satisfactory. 
 4. 
 What are our aims in connection with the cessation of hostilities on the part of the Allies? Our aims, as already mentioned, are peaceful economic building. 
 A detailed plan of it, on the basis of electrifica-tion, is being at present worked out by a committee of scien-tists and technicians—or rather, by a number of committees—in accordance with the resolution of the February (1920)session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee.

 21 TO THE WORKING WOMEN Comrades, the elections to the Moscow Soviet show that the Communist Party is gaining ground among the workingclass. 
 Working women must take a bigger part in the elections. 
 The Soviet government is the first and only government inthe world to have completely abolished all the old, despic-able bourgeois laws which placed women in a position ofinferiority to men, which placed men in a privileged position,for example, in respect of marital rights and of children. 
 The Soviet government, the government of the working people, is the first and only government in the world to haveabolished all the privileges of men in property questions,privileges which the marriage laws of all bourgeois republics,even the most democratic, still preserve. 
 Wherever there are landowners, capitalists and merchants, women cannot be the equal of men even before the law. 
 Where there are no landowners, capitalists or merchants, and where the government of the working people is build-ing a new life without these exploiters, men and women areequal before the law. 
 But that is not enough. 
 Equality before the law is not necessarily equality in fact. 
 We want the working woman to be the equal of the working man not only before the law but in actual fact. 
 For thisworking women must take an increasing part in the adminis-tration of socialised enterprises and in the administration of the state. 
 By taking part in administration, women will learn quick-ly and will catch up with the men. 
 Elect more working women to the Soviet, both Communist women and non-party women. 
 As long as they are honest working women capable of performing their work sensibly and conscientiously, even if they are not members of theParty—elect them to the Moscow Soviet! Send more working women to the Moscow Soviet! Let the Moscow proletariat show that it is prepared to do every-thing, and is doing everything, to fight for victory, to fight the old inequality, the old bourgeois humiliation of women! The proletariat cannot achieve complete liberty until it has won complete liberty for women.

 Lenin First published in 1942 Published according to a typewritten copy SPEECH AT THE THIRD ALL -RUSSIA CONFERENCE OF DIRECTORS OF ADULT EDUCATION DIVISIONS OF GUBERNIA EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS FEBRUARY 25, 1920 Permit me to greet your conference on behalf of the Council of People’s Commissars and to share a few ideaswith you. 
 As far as the international situation is concerned, I can tell you of a wireless message received today from Britainwhich better than anything else typifies it. 
 The message says that yesterday, the twenty-fourth, the Allied Council decided that in the event of the states bordering on Russiaasking its advice on policy it would say that it couldnot advise a war that would probably injure their interests,still less could it advise an aggressive war against Russia;if, however, the Russian Soviet Republic attacked their legitimate frontiers, the Allied Council would give them its support. 
 The Allied gentlemen also want to send toRussia a commission that belongs to the Washington labourcommittee. 
 The organisers of the conference, social-traitorsheaded by Albert Thomas, have agreed on certain socialreforms and want to send this crowd, which constitutes part of the League of Nations, 124 to Russia to investigate how far conditions in Russia coincide with the normalrequirements of “civilised” states. 
 The report of yesterday’s decision by the Allies shows clearly enough that those gentlemen have got themselvesinto a mess, and also what benefit we can gain from that mess. 
 They have wasted hundreds of millions (the British Government has) on support for the war and have now an-nounced that they can no longer support it. 
 Their offensive spirit is played out, although they are still delivering warmateriel to Poland; they are still delivering armaments andwe have authentic information that Poland is regrouping herforces for an offensive so that we cannot place any greatreliance on their announcement. 
 A certain threat still re-mains, although the external danger from the Allies has diminished by ninety per cent; we shall have to retain ourmilitary preparedness after the end of the war againstDenikin; we cannot count on full demobilisation. 
 Nine-tenths of the danger of an attack on Russia by international capitalism has, therefore, disappeared: they have suffered such a thorough collapse that are proposing for the umpteenth time to send a commission to Russia. 
 Ifthat commission is to consist of gentlemen like Albert Thom-as, who visited Russia during the war, it will end in noth-ing but a scandal for them and will be an excellent basisfor agitation for us. 
 We’ll give them such a welcome that they will leave Russia as quickly as possible and the only gain will be agitation for the workers of other countries. 
They want to scare us, but when we say we are welcomingthem as honoured guests, they will hide this attempt oftheirs. 
 That shows the extent to which they are dismayed. 
We now have a window open on to Europe, thanks to the peace with Estonia, and are able to obtain the basic goods from there. 
 There is, indeed, tremendous progress and im-provement in our international situation; nine-tenths ofall external danger to the Soviet Republic has beenremoved. 
 The more the danger is removed the more shall we be able to get on with our peaceful development, and we expect a lot from you and from your activities in the sphere ofadult education. 
 A number of material changes arenecessary to put education in schools on a better footing—schools must be built, teachers selected and internal reformscarried out in organising and in selecting the staff. 
 These are all things that require lengthy preparation. 
 You are not hampered by this lengthy preparation in adult edu-cation. 
 The demand of the people for an education outside the regular school system and the need for workers in this field are increasing very greatly. 
 We are sure that with the common aid and by our common efforts more will be done than has hitherto been the case. 
 In conclusion I shall speak about the nature of adult education, which is connected with propaganda andagitation. 
 One of the fundamental faults of education inthe capitalist world was its alienation from the basic task of organising labour, since the capitalist had to train and educate obedient and disciplined workers. 
 There was noconnection in capitalist society between the actual tasksof the organisation of social labour and teaching. 
 There wasdead, scholastic, routine teaching befouled by the influenceof the clergy which everywhere, even in the most democratic republics, functioned in such a way that everything fresh and healthy was compelled to withdraw. 
 Direct, vital workwas made difficult because no extensive education was pos-sible without a state apparatus and without material andfinancial aid. 
 Since we can and must prepare to transfer ourentire Soviet life from the path of military training and defence to that of peaceful development it is essential for you, workers in the field of adult education, to take thischange into consideration, and your propaganda work,its aims and programme should be made to fit thischange. 
 To show you how I understand the tasks and the entire character of education, of teaching, training and upbring-ing, in their connection with the changing tasks of the So-viet Republic, I would remind you of the resolution onelectrification that was adopted at the last session of theAll-Russia Central Executive Committee, you are probablyall familiar with it. 
 A few days ago there was an announce-ment in the papers that within two months (in the official printed report it said two weeks, but that was a mistake)—that within two months a plan for the electrification of thecountry would be elaborated to cover a minimum period oftwo to three years and a maximum period of ten years. 
 Thecharacter of all our propaganda, which includes purely Party propaganda, and school teaching, and adult educa-tion, must change, not in the sense that the fundamentalsand general direction of teaching should be changed, but in the sense that the character of the work must be adapted to the transition to peaceful development with an exten-sive plan for the industrial and economic reconstruction of the country, because the general economic difficulty andthe general task is the rehabilitation of the country’s eco-nomic forces so that the proletarian revolution can create thenew foundations of economic life side by side with pettypeasant economy. 
 Up to now the peasant has been compelled to loan grain to the workers’ state; the pieces of coloured paper called money received in return for grain do not satis-fy the peasant. 
 The peasant, being dissatisfied, is demand-ing his legitimate rights—in exchange for grain he wantsthe industrial goods that we cannot give him until we haverehabilitated the economy. 
 Rehabilitation—that is the basic task, but we cannot rehabilitate on the old economic and technical basis. 
 This is technically impossible and wouldbe absurd; we have to find a new basis. 
 This new basis isour electrification plan. 
 We are talking to the peasants, to the mass of less-de-veloped people, showing them that the new transition to a higher stage of culture and technical education is necessary for the success of all Soviet development. 
 And so, it is es-sential to restore the economy. 
 The most ignorant peasantwill understand that the economy has been wrecked by thewar and that he cannot overcome poverty and obtain thenecessary goods in exchange for grain unless we restore it. 
 All our work in the sphere of propaganda, school and adult education must be linked up closely with this mostimmediate and urgent need of the peasant in order not tobe isolated from the most urgent requirements of our dailylife; it should present them and their development in a waythe peasant understands; it must be stressed that the way out of the situation is only through the rehabilitation of industry. 
 Industry, however, cannot be rehabilitatedon the old basis, it must be rehabilitated on the basisof modern technology, which means the electrificationof industry and a higher culture. 
 Electrification takes upto ten years’ work, but it is work at a higher cultural and political level. 
 We shall evolve an extensive plan of work which must, in the minds of the peasantry, have a clearly defined practi-cal aim. 
 This cannot be done in a few months. 
 The minimum programme should cover no less than three years. 
 With-out lapsing into utopias we may say that in ten years we shall be able to cover all Russia with a networkof power stations and go over to an industry basedon electricity that will meet the requirements of moderntechnology and put an end to the old peasant farming. 
This, however, requires a higher level of education and culture. 
 Without hiding from ourselves the fact that the immediate practical task is the restoration of transport and the deliv-ery of food, and that with productivity at its present levelwe cannot undertake any extensive activites, you must nev-ertheless keep in mind and carry out, in the sphere of prop-aganda and education, the task of full rehabilitation on a basis commensurate with cultural and technical require-ments. 
 The old methods of propaganda are outmoded anduntil recently approached the peasants with general phrasesabout the class struggle; they served as grounds for the in-vention of all sorts of nonsense about proletarian culture, 125 etc. 
, but we shall very rapidly cure ourselves of all thisnonsense which seems very much like an infantile disorder. 
In propaganda and agitation, and in school and adulteducation, we shall present the question in a more soberand business-like manner, a manner worthy of the peopleof Soviet power who have learned something in the course of two years and who will go to the peasants with a practical, business-like and clear-cut plan for the reconstruction ofall industry and will demonstrate that with education atits present level the peasant and the worker will not beable to carry out this task and will not escape from filth,poverty, typhus and disease. 
 This practical task is clearly connected with cultural and educational improvements and must serve as the central point around which we mustgroup all our Party propaganda and activities, all ourschool and extra-mural teaching. 
 This will help to get asound grasp of the most urgent interests of the peasantmasses and will link up the general improvement in culture and knowledge with burning economic requirements to such an extent that we shall increase a hundredfold thedemand of the working-class masses for education. 
 We are absolutely certain that if we have solved the difficult war problem in two years, we shall solve a still more difficult problem—the cultural and educational problem—in five to ten years. 
 These are the ideas I wished to express to you.

) Brief report published on March 2, 1920 in Vecherniye Izvestia Moskovskogo Soveta Rabochikh i Krasnoarmeiskikh Deputatov No. 
 481 First published in full in 1930 Published according to the verbatim report SPEECH DELIVERE D AT THE FIRS T ALL-RUSSI A CONGRESS OF WORKIN G COSSACK S126 MARCH 1, 1920 Comrades, allow me first of all to greet the Congress on behalf of the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 I very much regret that I was unable to attend your meeting on the open-ing day and did not hear Comrade Kalinin’s report. 
 But fromwhat he has told me I conclude that many things relating to the direct and immediate tasks of Soviet development, and especially to the Cossacks, were dealt with in his speech. 
I should, therefore, like to deal mostly with the internation-al situation of the Soviet Republic and the tasks which con-front all the working masses, including the Cossacks, becauseof this situation. 
 Never has the international position of the Soviet Re-public been as favourable and as triumphant as it is now. 
If some thought is given to the way our internationalsituation has evolved in the course of two years ofuntold difficulties and incredible sacrifices, if somethought is given to the reasons for it, any intelligent person will discern the main forces, the mainsprings, and the chief alignment of forces in the incipient worldrevolution. 
 When, over two years ago, at the very beginning of the Russian revolution, we spoke about this approaching inter-national, world revolution, it was a prevision, and to a cer-tain extent a prediction. 
 And the vast majority of the work-ing people who did not live in the large cities and who hadnot had a schooling in the Party greeted this talk of an approaching world revolution with either mistrust or indifference, and at any rate with scanty understanding. 
 And, indeed, it was impossible and would have been unnatural to expect the vast mass of the working population, especiallythe peasant, farming population, who are scattered over animmense territory, to form in advance anything like a cor-rect idea of why world revolution was approaching, andwhether it really was international. 
 Our experience during these two incredibly difficult years and the experience of the working masses of remote border regions are worthy ofattention, and not of merely being brushed aside with theremark that times were hard but have now become easier. 
Yes, we must give thought to the reason why things happenedas they did, to the significance of their happening as they did, and to the lessons that are to be drawn from this; we must see which party’s views have been borne out by whatour own history and world history have demonstrated dur-ing these two years. 
 That is what I would like to deal withfirst of all. 
 From the standpoint of the international situation the issue is quite clear, when the matter is taken on a broad scale and regarded not from the standpoint of one partyor of one country, but from the standpoint of all countriestogether, when the matter is taken on a broad scale, thenparticular and trifling details recede into the backgroundand the chief motive forces of world history become apparent. 
 When we began the October Revolution by overthrowing the power of the landowners and capitalists, appealing forthe termination of the war, and addressing this appeal toour enemies; when after this we came under the yoke ofthe German imperialists; when after this, in October and November 1918, Germany was crushed, and Britain, France, America and the other Entente countries became the lordsof the earth—what was our situation then? The vast major-ity asked whether it was not then obvious that the cause ofthe Bolsheviks was hopeless. 
 And many added, “Not only isit hopeless, but the Bolsheviks have turned out to be frauds. 
 They promised peace, but instead, after the German yoke had been thrown off and Germany defeated, they were found tobe enemies of the whole Entente—that is, of Britain, France, America and Japan, the most powerful countries in the world; and Russia, ruined, weakened and exhausted by the imperialist war, and moreover by the Civil War, has now to hold out in a fight against the foremost countriesof the world. 
” This was easy to believe; and it is notsurprising that lack of faith made indifference and oftenactual hostility to the Soviet government more and morewidespread. 
 There is nothing surprising in it. 
 What is sur-prising is that we emerged victorious from the struggle against Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin who were supported inevery possible way by all the wealthiest powers in the world,powers which no other military force on earth can even ap-proximately equal. 
 The truth of this is clear to everybody,even to the blind, and even to those who are worse than blind, those who refuse to see at any price—even to them it is clear that we have emerged from this strugglevictorious. 
 How did this miracle happen? It is to this question that I would like most of all to direct your attention, becauseit most clearly reveals the chief motive forces of the entire international revolution. 
 By analysing this question in a practical way, we can supply an answer to it, for this issomething we have already been through; we are able tosay what happened after the event. 
 We were victorious because we could be and were united, and because we were able to win over allies from the camp of our enemies. 
 And our enemies, who are immeasurably stronger than we are, suffered defeat because they were not,never could be and never will be united, and because everymonth they fought against us brought them further disinte-gration within their own camp. 
 I shall now speak about the fact which proves these statements. 
 You know that after Germany was defeated, there was no-body in the world to oppose Britain, France and America. 
They had robbed Germany of her colonies, and there was nocorner on earth, there was not a single country, where themilitary might of the Entente did not prevail. 
 It would seem that under such circumstances, enemies of Soviet Rus-sia as they were, they must have clearly realised that Bol-shevism aims at world revolution. 
 We have never made a secret of the fact that our revolution is only the beginning, that its victorious end will come only when we have lit up the whole world with these same fires of revolution. 
 And we realised quite clearly that the capitalists were frenzied ene-mies of the Soviet government. 
 It should be mentioned thatwhen the European struggle was over they had an army ofmillions, and a powerful navy, to which we could not opposeeven the semblance of a navy or an army of any strength. 
 And all they had to do was to employ a few hundred thou-sand soldiers of this army of millions in the war against usin the same way as they were employed in the war againstGermany, and the Entente would have crushed us. 
 Therecannot be the slightest doubt of this in the minds of thosewho have examined this question from the theoretical stand-point, and especially of those who went through the last war and know it from their own experience and obser-vation. 
 Both Britain and France tried to seize Russia in this way. 
 They concluded a treaty with Japan, who had taken prac-tically no direct part in the imperialist war but who sup-plied a hundred thousand or so soldiers to crush the Soviet Republic, acting from the Far East. 
 Britain at that timelanded troops at Murmansk and Archangel, not to mentionthe movement in the Caucasus, while France landed soldiersand sailors in the South. 
 This was the first historical phaseof the struggle we sustained. 
 The Entente at that time had an army of millions and its soldiers were, of course, far superior to the whiteguard troopswhich were mustering in Russia and which had neitherorganisers nor arms. 
 And it sent these soldiers againstus. 
 But what the Bolsheviks had predicted happened. 
 Theysaid that it was not only the Russian revolution that was concerned, but the world revolution as well, and that the Bolsheviks had allies in the workers of all civilised coun-tries. 
 These prophecies were not realised in their direct format the time we proposed peace to all countries. 
 127 Our appeal did not meet with a general response. 
 But the strike in Ger-many in January 1918 128 showed us that there we had the support of fairly large forces of workers and not only of Liebknecht, who even in the days of the Kaiser had thecourage to declare publicly that the government and the bourgeoisie of Germany were robbers. 
 This strike ended in bloodshed and the suppression of the workers. 
 In the Entente countries, of course, the bourgeoisie deceived the workers, either Iying about our appeal or not publishing it at all. 
For this reason the appeal we made in November 1917 toall the nations produced no direct result, and those whothought that this appeal alone would call forth revolutionwere bound, of course, to be bitterly disappointed. 
 But we did not count only upon the appeal; we counted upon more profound motive forces. 
 We said that the revolution wouldproceed differently in different countries, and that of courseit was not merely a matter of removing a protege of Rasputinor a villainous landowner, but of a struggle against the moredeveloped and enlightened bourgeoisie. 
 And so, when the British landed troops in the North and the French in the South, the decisive test and the finaldenouement began. 
 The question of who was right was now toreceive its answer. 
 Were the Bolsheviks right when they saidthat in order to win the fight they had to rely upon the work-ers? Or were the Mensheviks right when they said that an attempt to make a revolution in one country would be sense-less and foolhardy, because it would be crushed by othercountries? You heard this kind of talk not only from Partypeople but even from people who were just beginning tothink about politics. 
 And then came the acid test. 
 For along time we did not know what the result would be; for a long time we could not judge the result; but now, after the event, we know what it was. 
 Even in the English newspapers,in spite of the frenzied lies about the Bolsheviks told by allthe bourgeois papers—even in those papers letters began toappear from British soldiers near Archangel, saying that onRussian soil they had come across leaflets in English explain-ing to them that they had been deceived, that they were being led against workers and peasants who had set up theirown state. 
 These soldiers wrote that they did not want tofight. 
 As for France, we know that there was a mutiny inthe navy for which tens, hundreds, and perhaps thousandsof Frenchmen are still doing penal servitude. 
 These sailors declared that they would not fight the Soviet Republic. 
 We can now see why neither French troops nor British troopsare fighting us at present, why the British soldiers have been removed from Archangel, and why the British Government dare not bring them on to our soil. 
 One of our political writers, Comrade Radek, wrote that the Russian soil would prove to be such that no soldier fromany other country who set foot on it would be able tofight. 
 This seemed to be too boastful a promise, it seemeda delusion. 
 But it proved correct. 
 The soil on which theSoviet revolution had taken place proved to be very danger-ous to all countries. 
 It seems that the Russian Bolsheviks were right; they had already managed to bring about unityamong the workers during the time of the tsar, and the work-ers had managed to create small cells, which greeted allwho believed them, whether French workers or Britishsoldiers, with propaganda in their own languages. 
 True, we had only tiny sheets, whereas in the British and French press propaganda was carried on by thousands of newspapers andevery phrase was publicised in tens of thousands of columns. 
We issued only two or three quarto sheets a month; at bestit worked out at only one copy for every ten thousand Frenchsoldiers. 
 129 I am not certain whether even that many reached their destination. 
 Why, then, did the French and British soldiers believe them? Because we told the truth, and becausewhen they came to Russia they saw that they had beendeceived. 
 They had been told that they were to defend theirown country; but when they came to Russia they found thatthey were to defend the rule of the landowners and capitalists, that they were to crush the revolution. 
 The reason we were able to win over these people in two years was that althoughthey had forgotten that they had once executed their ownkings, the moment they stepped on to Russian soil, the Rus-sian revolution and the victories of the Russian workers andpeasants reminded the soldiers of France and Britain of their own revolutions, and, thanks to the events in Russia, they recalled what had once happened in their owncountries. 
 And this showed that the Bolsheviks were right, that our hopes were better founded than those of the capitalists, al-though we had neither funds nor arms, while the Entente had both arms and an invincible army. 
 But we won the sympathy of these invincible armies, so much so that they dare notbring either British soldiers or French soldiers against us, knowing from experience that every such attempt turns against them. 
 That is one of the miracles that have occurred in Soviet Russia. 
 Now, after four years of war, when ten million people have been killed and twenty million crippled, when theimperialists are asking themselves what the war was for—such questions lead to some very interesting revelations. 
Certain negotiations which took place in 1916 were recently made public in France—the Austrian monarch began peace negotiations with France as early as 1916, but France keptquiet about it, and Albert Thomas, who called himself asocialist and who was then a member of the Cabinet, came toRussia to promise Constantinople, the Dardanelles and Ga-licia to Nicholas II. 
 All these facts have now become widely known, they have been published in a French newspaper. 
 The French workers are now saying to Albert Thomas:“You said that you had joined the Cabinet in order to protectour French fatherland and the interests of the French work-ers; yet in 1916, when the Austrian monarch proposed peace,you, Albert Thomas, concealed the fact, and as a result mil-lions of people perished in order that the French capitalists might make more profit. 
” These exposures are not ended yet. 
We began them by publishing the secret treaties, and thewhole world saw why millions of people had perished, whymillions of people had been sacrificed, they had been sac-rificed in order that Nicholas II might secure the Dardanelles and Galicia. 
 All the imperialists knew this. 
 So did the Men-sheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries; and if they did not,they were downright idiots not to have studied politics anddiplomacy enough to have known what has now been madepublic in the French papers. 
 These exposures are now becom-ing more profound, and there will be no end to them. 
 Thanks to this, the workers and peasants in every country are begin-ning more and more keenly to sense the truth and to realisewhat the imperialist war was about. 
 That is why they arebeginning to believe us, to see that we spoke the truth, andto see that the imperialists were lying when they led them todefend the fatherland. 
 That explains the miracle of our having won the sympa-thies of the soldiers of Britain and France, weak and helplessas we were from the military standpoint. 
 It is no longer a /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR prediction, but a fact. 
 True, the victory cost us untold hard-ships and incredible sacrifices. 
 During the past two years we have suffered untold torments of starvation which became particularly acute when we were cut off from the grain ofthe East and the South. 
 Nevertheless, we gained a victory,and a victory that is not only for our country, but for allcountries, for all mankind. 
 Never before has there been acase in history when powerful military states have been un-able to fight a country so helpless in the military field as the Soviet Republic. 
 Why did this miracle happen?Because when we, the Bolsheviks, led the Russian people intothe revolution, we knew very well that this revolution wouldbe a painful one, that it would cost millions of lives; but weknew that we would have the working masses of all coun-tries behind us, and that our truth, by exposing all lies, would triumph more and more as time went on. 
 After the campaign of the powers against Russia had failed, they tried another weapon. 
 The bourgeoisie of those coun-tries have hundreds of years of experience, and were able toreplace their own unreliable weapons by others. 
 At first they tried to use their own soldiers to crush and stifle Russia; now they are trying it with the help of the borderstates. 
 Tsarism, the landowners and the capitalists used to op-press a number of the border nations—Latvia, Finland, andso on, where they aroused hatred by centuries of oppression. 
 “Great Russian” became a most hateful word to all these na-tions which had been drenched in blood. 
 And so the Entente,having failed in fighting the Bolsheviks with the help of itsown soldiers, is now banking on the small states, hoping tostrangle Soviet Russia with their help. 
 Churchill, who is pursuing the same sort of policy as Nicholas Romanov, wants to fight, and is fighting, without paying the slightest heed to parliament. 
 He boasted that hewould lead fourteen states against Russia—that was in1919—and that Petrograd would be captured in Septemberand Moscow in December. 
 He was a little too boastful. 
 Hebanked on the hatred of Russia in all these small states; but he forgot that in these small states there is a clear un-derstanding of what Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin mean. 
They were once within a few weeks of complete victory. 
 During Yudenich’s campaign, when he was quite close to Petrograd, an article appeared in The Times , the richest of the British newspapers—I read this editorial myself—which implored, ordered, demanded that Finland help Yudenich—the eyes of the whole world are upon you; you will saveliberty, civilisation and culture all over the world. 
 Take thefield against the Bolsheviks! This is what Britain said toFinland, and Britain has Finland completely in her pocket; it was said to Finland, who is up to her ears in debt, and who dares not utter a squeak because without Britain she hasnot enough grain to last her a week. 
 Such was the pressure brought to bear on all these small states to make them fight Bolshevism. 
 And it failed twice. 
It failed because the peace policy of the Bolsheviks turned out to be a serious one, and was judged by its enemies to be more honest than the peace policy of any other country,and because a number of countries thought, “Much as we hateGreat Russia, which used to suppress us, we know that itwas Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin who suppressed us, andnot the Bolsheviks. 
” The former head of the Finnish whhe-guard government has not forgotten that in November 1917 he personally received a document from my hands in whichwe said without the slightest hesitation that we unreser-vedly recognised Finland’s independence. 
 130 At that time this seemed a mere gesture. 
 It was thought that the revolt of the Finnish workers would cause it to be forgotten. 
 But no, such things are not forgotten when they are corroborated by the whole policy of a definite party. 
 Andeven the Finnish bourgeois government said, “Let’s think itover. 
 After all, we have learned something during a hundredand fifty years of oppression by the Russian tsars. 
 If wetake the field against the Bolsheviks, we shall help to install Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin. 
 And who are they? Don’t we know? Are they not the same breed oftsarist generals who stifled Finland, Latvia, Polandand many other nationalities? And shall we help theseenemies of ours to fight the Bolsheviks? No, let uswait!” They did not dare to refuse outright—they are dependent on the Entente. 
 They did not help us directly; they waited,temporised, wrote Notes, sent delegations, formed commis-sions, sat in conference, and did so until Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin had been crushed and the Entente defeated in the second campaign too. 
 We were the victors. 
 If all these small states had taken the field against us— they were supplied with hundreds of millions of dollarsand the finest guns and weapons, and had British instructorswho had been through the war—if they had taken the fieldagainst us, there is not the slightest doubt that we would have been defeated. 
 Everybody knows that very well. 
 But they did not take the field against us, because they realisedthat the Bolsheviks are more honest. 
 When the Bolshevikssay that they recognise the independence of any nation, thattsarist Russia was based on the oppression of other nations,and that the Bolsheviks never supported this policy, do not support it and never will support it, and that they will never go to war to oppress other nations—when they say that,they are believed. 
 We know this not from the Latvian orPolish Bolsheviks, but from the bourgeoisie of Poland, Lat-via, the Ukraine and so on. 
 Here the international significance of the Bolshevik policy had its effect. 
 It was a test on international and not on Russian soil. 
 It was a test by fire and sword, andnot by words. 
 It was a test in the last decisive struggle. 
The imperialists realised that they had no soldiers of theirown, that they could strangle Bolshevism only by musteringinternational forces; but all international forces were beaten. 
 What does imperialism mean? It means that a handful of rich powers have a stranglehold on the whole world,when they know that they have the fifteen hundred millionpeople of the world in their hands and have a strangleholdon them, and when these fifteen hundred million feel what British culture, French culture and American civilisation mean—rob for all you are worth! Today three-quar-ters of Finland has already been bought up by Americanmultimillionaires. 
 The officers who came from Britainand France to our border states to instruct their troopsbehaved like insolent scions of the Russian nobility in a defeated country. 
 They all profiteered right and left. 
 And the more the Finnish, Polish and Latvian workers starve, themore they are squeezed by a handful of British, American and French multimillionaires and their henchmen. 
 And this is going on all over the world. 
 The Russian Socialist Republic alone has raised the standard of war for real emancipation; and sympathy isturning in its favour all over the world. 
 Through the smallcountries, we have won the sympathy of all the nations ofthe world, and they represent hundreds of millions of people. 
They are at present oppressed and downtrodden, they are the most backward part of the population; but the war has en-lightened them. 
 Huge masses of people were drawn into theimperialist war. 
 Britain brought regiments from India tofight the Germans. 
 France called millions of Africans tothe colours to fight the Germans. 
 They were formed intoshock units and hurled into the most dangerous sectors, where they were mown down like grass by machine-guns. 
 But they learned something. 
 Under the tsar the Russiansoldiers said, “If die we must, then let it be fighting the land-owners”—now the Africans say, “If die we must, then let itnot be to help the French predators rob the German capital-ist predators, but to emancipate ourselves from the capital-ists, German and French. 
” In every country of the world, even in India, where three hundred million people are oppressedand treated as labourers by the British, minds are awaken-ing and the revolutionary movement is growing from day today. 
 They all look towards one star, the star of the SovietRepublic, because they know that it made tremendous sacrifices in order to fight the imperialists, and that it has withstood the most severe trials. 
 This was the significance of the second card of the En-tente to be beaten—victory on an international scale. 
 Itmeans that our peace policy is approved by the vast majorityof people all over the world. 
 It means that the number of our allies in all countries is growing—much more slowly than we would like, it is true, but growing nevertheless. 
 The victory we won in the offensive engineered against us by Churchill shows that ~ur policy was right. 
 And afterthat we won a third victory—a victory over the bourgeoisintelligentsia, over the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks, who in all countries were rabidly hostile to us. 
 They all began to oppose the war against Soviet Russia. 
In all countries the bourgeois intelligentsia, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks—this breed, unfortunately, is to be found in all countries ( applause )—condemned inter-ference in Russian affairs. 
 They declared in all countries that it was a disgrace. 
 When Britain proposed that the Germans blockade So-viet Russia, and Germany refused, this exhaused the patienceof the British and other Socialist-Revolutionaries andMensheviks. 
 They said, “We are enemies of the Bolsheviks and regard them as violators and robbers. 
 But we cannot support the proposal that the Germans join us in stranglingRussia by a hunger blockade. 
” And so, within the camp ofthe enemies, inside their own countries, in Paris, Londonand so on, where Bolsheviks are being hounded and treatedin the way revolutionaries were treated under the tsar—in all cities, the bourgeois intelligentsia have issued the call “Hands off Soviet Russia!” In Great Britain this is the slo-gan under which the bourgeois intelligentsia are summoningmeetings and issuing manifestos. 
 That is why the blockade had to be lifted. 
 They could not restrain Estonia, and we have concluded peace and can trade with her. 
 We have cut a window open on the civilised world. 
 We have the sympathy of the majority of the work-ing people, and the bourgeoisie are anxious to start tradewith Russia as soon as possible. 
 Now the imperialists are afraid of us, and they have reason to be, for Soviet Russia has emerged from this war stronger than ever. 
 British writers have written that the armies all over the world are disintegrating, and that ifthere is any country in the world whose army is gainingstrength, that country is Soviet Russia. 
 They tried toslander Comrade Trotsky and said that this was so becausethe Russian army is being kept under iron discipline, which is enforced by ruthless measures, as well as by skilful and widespread agitation. 
 We have never denied this. 
 War is war, and it demands iron discipline. 
 Have you capitalist gentlemen not employedthe same methods? Have you not carried on agitation? Haveyou not a hundred times more paper and printing works? To compare our literature with yours is like comparing a mole-hill to a mountain. 
 Yet your propaganda has failed, andours has succeeded. 
 The Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks tried an experiment to see whether it was not possible to get along with the capitalists peacefully, and to pass from them to social reform. 
 In Russia they wanted to go over to socialreform in an amicable way, so as not to offend the capital-ists. 
 They forgot that capitalists are capitalists, and thatthe only thing to do with them is to vanquish them. 
 Theysay that in the Civil War the Bolsheviks have drenched the country in blood. 
 But, my dear Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, did you not have eight months to experi-ment in? Were you not in power with Kerensky fromFebruary to October 1917, during which period you had thehelp of all the Cadets, of the whole Entente, of all the rich-est countries in the world? Your programme then was one of social reform, without civil war. 
 Is there a fool in the world who would have resorted to revolution if you had real-ly begun social reform? Why did you not do so? Because yourprogramme was a blank, an absurd dream. 
 Because it isimpossible to come to terms with the capitalists and securetheir obedience peacefully, especially after four years of imperialist war. 
 Do you think there are no clever people in Britain, France and Germany who understand that theywent to war for the division of colonies, and that ten mil-lion people were killed and twenty million crippled overthe division of the spoils? That is what capitalism means. 
How can you expect to persuade, how can you expect to come to terms with this capitalism which has crippled twenty million people and killed ten million? And we say to theMensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, “You had theopportunity of trying your experiment. 
 Why did nothingcome of it? Because your programme was a sheer uto-pia, a utopia not only for Russia, but even for Germany, the Germany where the German Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, whom nobody will listen to, are now inpower, the Germany where a German Kornilov, armedfrom head to foot, is preparing reaction, 131 the German republic where fifteen thousand workers have been slaugh-tered in the streets of the cities. 
 And this is called a democ-ratic republic!” Yet the German Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries have the hardihood to say that the Bol-sheviks are a wicked lot, that they have reduced the country to a state of civil war, whereas in their own country social peace prevails and only fifteen thousand workers have been killed in the streets! They say that the Civil War and bloodshed in Russia are due to the fact that it is a backward country. 
 But tell us,why is the same thing happening in countries like Finlandwhich are not backward? Why is there a White Terror in Hun-gary which has shocked the whole world? Why were Luxem-burg and Liebknecht assassinated in the German republic, where since the overthrow of the Kaiser, the Mensheviks andSocialist-Revolutionaries have been in power? And why isit not the Mensheviks who are strong there, but Kornilov—and the Bolsheviks too, who, although they are crushed, arestrong because of their faith in the justice of their cause and because of their influence over the masses? There you have the world revolution—which they said the Bolsheviks were using to deceive the people with, when asa matter of fact all hopes of compromise proved to be sheernonsense. 
 A big tussle is developing among the bourgeois coun-tries themselves. 
 America and Japan are on the verge of flinging themselves at each other’s throats because Japan satsnug during the imperialist war and has grabbed nearly thewhole of China, which has a population of four hundred mil-lion. 
 The imperialist gentlemen say. 
 “We are in favour of arepublic, we are in favour of democracy; but why did the Japanese grab more than they should under our very noses?” Japan and America are on the verge of war, and there isabsolutely no possibility of preventing that war, in whichanother ten million will be killed and twenty million crip-pled. 
 France, too, says, “Who got the colonies?—Britain. 
”France was victorious, but she is up to her ears in debt; she is in a hopeless position, whereas Britain has piled up wealth. 
 Over there, new combinations and alliances arealready being engineered. 
 They want to fling themselves ateach other’s throats again over the division of colonies. 
 Andan imperialist war is again brewing and cannot be preven-ted. 
 It cannot be prevented, not because the capitalists, taken individually, are vicious—individually they are just like other people—but because they cannot free themselvesof the financial meshes in any other way, because the whole world is in debt, in bondage, and because private property has led and always will lead to war. 
 All this is causing the roots of the international revolu-tion to strike deeper and deeper. 
 Because of this we havewon over the French and British soldiers; because of thiswe have won the confidence of the small states, and ourinternational position is now better than ever before. 
 Andon the basis of a simple calculation we can say that though many hardships still await us, the worst difficulties have already been overcome. 
 The all-powerful Entente no longerholds out any terrors for us: we have defeated it in decisivebattles. 
 ( Applause . 
) True, they may still incite Poland against us. 
 The Polish landowners and capitalists are growling and threatening, saying that they want to get back the territory of 1772, 132 that they want to subjugate the Ukraine. 
 We know that France is inciting Poland, flinging millions into that coun-try, because France is bankrupt anyhow and is now puttingher last stake on Poland. 
 And we say to the comrades in Po-land that we respect her liberty as we respect the liberty of every other nation, and that the Russian workers and peas-ants, who have experienced the yoke of tsarism, know verywell what that yoke meant. 
 We know that it was a heinouscrime to divide Poland up among the German, Austrian andRussian capitalists, and that this division doomed thePolish nation to long years of oppression, when the use of the native language was regarded as a crime, and when the whole Polish nation was brought up in one idea, namely, to throwoff this treble yoke. 
 We therefore understand the hatred thePoles feel, and we declare to them that we shall never crossthe line on which our troops are now stationed—and theyare stationed a long way from any Polish population. 
 We are proposing peace on this basis, because we know that this will be a tremendous acquisition for Poland. 
 We do notwant war on account of frontiers, because we want to oblite-rate that accursed past when every Great Russian wasregarded as an oppressor. 
 But since Poland responds to our peace proposal by silence, since she continues to give a free hand to French imperialism, which is inciting her to a war against Russiasince fresh trainloads of munitions are arriving in Poland every day and the Polish imperialists threaten to start a war on Russia, we say, “Just try it! You’ll get a lesson you’ll never forget. 
” ( Applause . 
) When soldiers died during the imperialist war for the enrichment of the tsar and the landowners, we said franklyand openly that defence of the fatherland in the imperialistwar was treachery, that it meant defence of the Russian tsar,who was to get the Dardanelles, Constantinople, and so on. 
 But now that we have published the secret treaties, now that we have embarked on a revolution against imperialist war,now that we have borne untold hardships for the sake of thatrevolution, now that we have shown that the capitalists inRussia have been suppressed and dare not even dream ofreturning to the old system, we say that we are not defend-ing the right to plunder other nations, but are defending our proletarian revolution, and will defend it to the very end. 
The Russia which has been emancipated and which for twoyears has borne untold suffering for the sake of her Sovietrevolution—that Russia we shall defend to our last drop ofblood! ( Applause . 
) We know that the time is gone when we were pressed on all sides by imperialist armies and when the working folkof Russia still did not understand the tasks that confrontedus. 
 Guerrilla methods prevailed then, each tried to grab aweapon for himself without consideration for the causeas a whole, and disorder and robbery prevailed in the locali-ties. 
 In the course of these two years we have created a united and disciplined army. 
 It has been a very difficulttask. 
 You know that the science of war cannot be learned allat once and you also know that only the officers, the colonelsand generals, who have remained from the tsarist army,know that science. 
 You have heard, of course, that these old colonels and generals have been responsible for a great deal of treachery, which cost us tens of thousands of lives. 
 Allsuch traitors had to be cleared out, and at the same timewe had to select a corps of commanders from among the for-mer officers, so that the workers and peasants might learnfrom them-for a modern army cannot be built up without science, and we have had to put it in the hands of military experts. 
 It has been a difficult task, but that, too, we haveaccomplished. 
 We have created a united army, an army which is now directed by the advanced section, by experienced Communists, who have everywhere succeeded in putting agitation and pro-paganda on a proper footing. 
 True, the imperialists are alsocarrying on propaganda, but the peasants are already begin-ning to understand that there are different kinds of propa-ganda. 
 They are beginning to tell by instinct what is trueand what is false. 
 At any rate, the propaganda which is being carried on by the Mensheviks and which was carried on by Kolchak and Denikin is no longer as successful as it was. 
Take their posters and pamphlets. 
 They talk about a Con-stituent Assembly, they talk about liberty and a republic. 
But the workers and peasants, who have secured liberty atthe price of their blood, now understand that the term “Con-stituent Assembly” serves as a screen for the capitalists; and if anything decided the issue of the struggle againstKolchak and Denikin in our favour, despite the fact thatthey were supported by the Great Powers, it was that boththe peasants and working Cossacks, who for a long timeremained in the other camp, have in the end come over to the workers and peasants—and it was only this that final-ly decided the war and brought about our victory. 
 With this victory behind us, we must now do our utmost to consolidate it on another front, the bloodless front, thefront of the war against the economic chaos to which we havebeen reduced by the war against the landowners and capi-talists, against Kolchak and Denikin. 
 You know what this victory has cost us; you know what a desperate fight we hadto put up when we were cut off from the grain-growingregions, from the Urals and Siberia. 
 At that time the Moscowand Petrograd workers had to suffer intolerable torments ofhunger. 
 Attempts were made to frighten you with the term “dictatorship of the proletariat”, to frighten the peasants and working Cossacks, and instil into their minds the ideathat dictatorship meant the arrogant rule of the worker. 
Actually, however, while Britain and America were doing allthey could to support Kolchak and Denikin, the workers ofthe central cities, exercising their dictatorship, did their best to show everyone by their example how to break away from the landowners and capitalists and march with theworking people; for labour unites, while property disunites. 
 That was the thesis we stuck to throughout these two years, and it led us to victory. 
 We were united by labour, whereas the Entente is steadily disintegrating, because property has turned the imperialists into wild beasts, who from firstto last are always squabbling over the division of spoils. 
Labour has made us a force that is uniting all the workingpeople. 
 And now “dictatorship” is a word that can frighten onlyutterly ignorant people, if such are still to be found in Russia. 
 I do not know if any person still remains who has not been taught a lesson by Kolchak and Denikin, and who hasnot come to realise what the dictatorship of the proletariatmeans—it means that never has the proletariat of Petro-grad, Moscow and the industrial centres suffered such hard-ships as during these past two years. 
 The peasants of the producing gubernias are now in such a position that they, having possession of the land, get the whole product forthemselves. 
 Since the Bolshevik revolution the Russianpeasants, for the first time in thousands of years, are workingfor themselves and can feed better. 
 Yet at the same time,during these two years of struggle the workers, the proletari-at, while exercising their dictatorship, have been suffer-ing untold torments of hunger. 
 You now see that dictator-ship means leadership, the union of the disunited andscattered working masses, a single, closely-knit whole directedagainst the capitalists in order to defeat them and to preventa recurrence of the bloodshed in which ten million people perished and twenty million were crippled. 
 The union of all the labouring people, a single iron will is required to defeata force like this, which can rely on mighty armies and modernculture. 
 This single iron will can be furnished only by theworking masses, only by the workers, the proletariat, onlyby those class-conscious workers whom decades of strikes and demonstrations have trained in struggle, and who have succeeded in overthrowing tsarism. 
 It can be furnished onlyby the workers who have borne the brunt of the two years ofunparalleled civil war, fighting in the front ranks and creat-ing a united Red Army, which has been joined by tens ofthousands of the finest workers, peasants and military and political students, who have been the first to perish and who, in Moscow, Petrograd, Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Tver, Yaroslavland all the industrial cities, have been suffering the terrible torments of hunger. 
 And this hunger has welded the workers together and brought the peasants and working Cossacks of the producing gubernias to see for themselves that the Bol-sheviks were right, for the workers were thus enabled to holdtheir own in the struggle against the whiteguards. 
 That is why the working class is entitled to say that by these two years of sacrifice and war it has proved to allthe working peasants and to every working Cossack that we must unite and join forces. 
 We must fight those who are profiteering on the famine because they find it more profit-able to sell grain at a thousand rubles a pood than to sellit at the fixed price. 
 There is money to be made that way,but it leads back to the old times,-and we shall once morefind ourselves in that accursed pit where tsarism ruled and where the capitalists condemned humanity to the impe-rialist slaughter for the sake of their profits. 
 It would turnus back, and that is something that cannot be allowed. 
 Afterthe struggle against Kolchak and Denikin, the working peas-ants and Cossacks came to realise the truth that we needunity, and they are taking their places by the side of the workers and looking upon the working class as their leaders. 
 The working peasants saw that no injury derived from theworkers’ government for there was none to see; it was onlythe landowners, capitalists and kulaks who did, but then,they are the worst enemies of the working people, they arethe allies of those imperialists who were the cause of the bloody war and all the miseries of the people. 
 All working people must unite—only then shall we be victorious. 
 The bloody war is over and we are now waging a bloodless war, a war against the economic chaos, ruin, poverty anddisease to which we have been reduced by four years of impe-rialist war and two years of civil war. 
 You know that the economic chaos is terrible. 
 In the border regions of Russia, in Siberia and in the South there are today tens of millionsof poods of grain; millions of poods have already been col-lected and transported, yet there is a terrible famine inMoscow, people are dying of starvation because grain cannotbe delivered, and it cannot be delivered because the Civil War has completely devastated the country, wrecked the railways and destroyed scores of bridges. 
 Locomotives havebroken down, and we are unable to repair them quickly. 
 We are now trying with great difficulty to secure aid from abroad. 
 We know, however, that it is now possible to start on the complete restoration of industry. 
 How are we going to restore industry when we cannot exchange manufactured goods for grain because there aren’tany? We know that when the Soviet government takes grain from the peasants at a fixed price it pays them only in paper. 
 What is this paper worth? Although it is not the price of the grain we can only pay in paper money. 
 But we say thatthis is essential, that the peasants must give their grainas a loan. 
 Is there a single well-fed peasant who wouldrefuse bread to a hungry worker if he knew that this worker,once he had been fed, would repay him in goods? No honest and politically-conscious peasant would refuse to give grain as a loan. 
 Peasants who have surplus grain must let thestate have it for paper money—and that means a loan. 
 Theonly people who do not understand, who do not realise this,are the supporters of capitalism and exploitation, those whowant the well-fed man to profit even more at the expense of the hungry man. 
 The workers’ government cannot tolerate that, and we shall stop at no sacrifice to combat it. 
 ( Ap-plause . 
) We have now concentrated all our forces on the restora-tion of industry and are steadfastly waging this new war,in which we shall be as victorious as we have been hitherto. 
 We have instructed a commission of scientists and engineers to draw up a plan for the electrification of Russia. 
 The planwill be ready in two months and will enable us to geta full and clear picture of how, in a few years, the whole ofRussia will be covered by a network of electric transmis-sion lines, will be restored in a new way, not the old way, and how she will achieve that culture which our prisoners of war saw in Germany. 
 That is the way we must restore our industry, and that is the way we shall return a hundredfold the loan of grainwe are taking from the peasants. 
 We know that this cannotbe done in a year or two; the minimum programme of electri-fication is calculated for a period of not less than three years, and the complete success of this advanced industrywill require not less than ten years. 
 But if we were able to hold on for two years in such a bloody war, we shall be able to hold on for ten years and more in face of any difficulties. 
 We have gained that experience in leading the masses with the help of urban workers which will carry us through alldifficulties on this bloodless front of struggle againsteconomic chaos and will lead to greater victories than thosewe gained in the war against international imperialism.

 Lenin, Speech Delivered at the First All-Russia Congress of Working Cossacks , Moscow, 1920 SPEECH DELIVERE D AT THE SECON D ALL-RUSSIA CONGRESS OF MEDICA L WORKER S133 MARCH 1, 1920 MINUTES (Comrade Lenin , who was greeted by prolonged applause and by the singing of the Internationale, delivered a brief speech of greeting . 
) Comrades, allow me to greet your Congress on behalf of the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 There is no need to speak here at length about the purposes of the Con-gress and the work you have done. 
 With the exception ofthe war front, there is perhaps no field of work that hasinvolved so many sacrifices as yours. 
 Four years of imperial-ist war have given mankind several million cripples and a number of epidemics. 
 A tremendous, difficult and responsible task has fallen on our shoulders. 
 The struggle on the war front has shownthat the attempts of the imperialists have produced noresults The greatest difficulties in the military field are behind us, but we must now set about the task of peaceful de-velopment. 
 The experience we gained on the bloody front weshall apply to the bloodless front, where we shall meet withfar greater sympathy. 
 We have succeeded in enlisting the services of thousands of experts, of a vast number of officers and generals, who are occupying responsible posts side by side with Communist workers. 
 We must apply all the determination and all theexperience of the Civil War to the fight against epidemics. 
 Time was when members of the medical profession, too, entertained a distrust of the working class; time was when they, too, dreamed of the restoration of the bourgeois sys-tem. 
 But now they, too, are convinced that only togetherwith the proletariat will it be possible to achieve a flourish-ing state of culture in Russia. 
 Only collaboration betweenscientists and workers can put an end to oppressive poverty,disease and dirt. 
 And this will be done. 
 No forces of darkness can withstand an alliance of the scientists, the proletariat and the technologists.

 ORGANISATIONS ON PREPARATIONS FOR THE PARTY CONGRESS Dear Comrades, The Party Congress has been appointed for March 27. 
 The agenda of the Congress has been published, and no doubt all Party organisations have already begun to prepare forthe Congress. 
 The Central Committee of the Party deems itits duty to express certain views in connection with thiswork. 
 Our Party, which by its persistent struggle over a period of fifteen years (1903-17) had proved its bonds with the working class of Russia, its ability to combat bourgeoisinfluences within the working class and to lead the revolu-tionary struggle of the proletariat in the most diverse andmost difficult circumstances, naturally had to take upon it-self the direct implementation of the tasks of the dictator-ship of the proletariat after the October Revolution. 
 The Congress of our Party is therefore of the utmost importancenot only for the entire working-class movement, but also forthe entire development of Soviet power and for the guidanceof the Russian—and to a certain extent the international—communist movement. 
 The importance of our Party Congress in this respect is still further enhanced by the specific features of the presentmoment, when the Soviet government has to accomplisha most difficult transition from the military tasks that for-merly absorbed its entire attention to the tasks of peacefuleconomic development. 
 The membership of our Party has greatly increased, chiefly owing to the immense influx of workers and peasantsduring the Party Weeks that were organised at the most difficult period of our revolution, when Yudenich and De-nikin were closest to Petrograd and Moscow. 
 The workers and peasants who joined the Party at such a critical moment constitute a fine and reliable body of leaders of the revolu-tionary proletariat and of the non-exploiting section of thepeasantry. 
 We are confronted with the task of helping, asrapidly, successfully and efficiently as possible, to completethe training of these new members of the Party, of helping to mould them into a body of builders of communism, people who are the most politically conscious and capable of fill-ing the most responsible posts, and at the same time mostclosely connected with the masses, i. 
e. 
, with the majorityof the workers and of the peasants who do not exploit thelabour of others. 
 Relevant to the specific nature of the present moment, the chief item on the agenda of the forthcoming Congress willbe the question of economic development and, in particular,of the measures, ways and means, and results of havinga greater proportion of workers in our chief administrations,central boards and Soviet government apparatus in general. 
 This must be the principal question at the Party Con-gress, for the principal question in the entire Soviet develop-ment in Russia (and—inasmuch as she has become the cen-tre of the world revolution—to a large extent in internationalcommunism as well) is the transition from the fight on the bloody front to the fight on the bloodless front, the front of labour, the front of the war against economic chaos, thewar for the restoration, improvement, reorganisation anddevelopment of Russia’s entire economy. 
 The procurement and transportation of large state sup-plies of foodstuffs, the restoration of the ruined transport system, the implementation of these measures with military speed, energy and discipline; side by side with this and in-divisibly from it, the greater proportion of workers employedin the Soviet government apparatus, the elimination ofsabotage and red tape from this apparatus, the achievementof the maximum productivity of labour, the utmost exertion of all the forces of the country for the restoration of the econ-omy—such is the task imperatively dictated by circum-stances, an urgent task demanding methods involving the supreme revolutionary energy of millions and millions of workers and peasants. 
 The Party Congress must take into account the experience of the labour armies, that young and new institution; itmust take into account the experience gained by the entireapparatus of Soviet government over a period of more thantwo years, and adopt a number of decisions permitting thewhole of our Socialist Republic to concentrate all the forces of the working people with redoubled firmness, determination, energy and efficiency on achieving the best possible solutionof the urgent problem of rapidly and thoroughly overcomingeconomic chaos. 
 We invite all Party members and all Party organisations to concentrate the maximum effort on this problem, both in the practical work of all Soviet institutions and in the work of preparation for the Congress. 
 For these tasks merge intoone indivisible whole. 
 Happily, the time for purely theoretical discussions, dis-putes over general questions and the adoption of resolu-tions on principles has passed. 
 That stage is over; it was dealt with and settled yesterday and the day before yester-day. 
 We must march ahead, and we must realise that we arenow confronted by a practical task, the business task of rapidly overcoming economic chaos, and we must do it withall our strength, with truly revolutionary energy, and withthe same devotion with which our finest worker and peasant comrades, the Red Army men, defeated Kolchak, Yudenich and Denikin. 
 We must march ahead, we must look ahead, and we must bring to the Congress the practical experience of economic de-velopment to which thought has been given and which hasbeen carefully analysed by the common labour and common effort of all members of the Party. 
 We have learned something, and in order to march ahead and to overcome economic chaos, what we have to do is notto start anew, not to reconstruct everything right and left,but to utilise to the utmost what has already been created. 
 There must be as little general reconstruction as possible and as many as possible business-like measures, ways, means and directions for the attainment of our chief aim whichhave been tested in practice and verified by results—we must have more workers in our apparatus, and see that it is done still more widely, still more rapidly and still better, we must enlist an even greater number of workers and labouring peasants in the work of administering industry and thenational economy generally; not only must we enlist indi-vidual workers and peasants who have best proved themselveson the job, but we must enlist to a larger extent the trade unions and conferences of non-party workers and peasants; we must enlist literally all bourgeois specialists (because there are incredibly few of them)—i. 
e. 
, specialists who have beentrained under bourgeois conditions and who have reaped thefruits of bourgeois culture. 
 We must organise things sothat, in conformity with the demands of our Party Pro-gramme, our working masses may really learn from these bourgeois specialists and at the same time place them “in a comradely environment of common labour hand in hand withthe masses of rank-and-file workers led by class-consciousCommunists” (as our Party Programme puts it); such areour chief aims. 
 Comrades, we have hitherto been able to surmount the untold difficulties which history has placed in the way of the first socialist republic because the proletariat hasproperly understood its tasks as dictator, i. 
e. 
, as the lead-er, organiser and teacher of all the working people. 
 Wewon because we have always correctly defined the mosturgent, insistent and pressing task and have really con-centrated on this task the forces of all the working people of the whole nation. 
 Military victories are easier to win than economic vic-tory. 
 It was much easier to defeat Kolchak, Yudenich andDenikin than to defeat the old petty-bourgeois customsrelations, habits and economic conditions upheld and repro-duced by millions and millions of small owners, alongside of the workers, together with them, and in the midst of them. 
 Victory in this field requires greater endurance, greater patience, greater persistence, greater steadfastness, greatersystem in work, greater organisational and administrativeskill on the grand scale. 
 This is what we, a backward nation lack most of all. 
 Let all members of the Party exert their efforts to bring to the Party Congress practical experience, tested, analysed and summarised. 
 If we bend all our efforts and succeed in pooling, testing and analysing in a careful, thoroughgoing and business-like way this practical experience, exactly what each of us has attempted and completed, or has seenothers attempt and complete, then, and only then, willour Party Congress, and, following it, all our Soviet insti-tutions, accomplish the practical task of overcoming eco-nomic chaos as rapidly and surely as possible. 
 From congresses and meetings to discuss general ques-tions to congresses and meetings to summarise practical experience —that is the slogan of our times. 
 The task of the moment and the task of the Party Congress, as we con-ceive it, is to learn from practical experience, to discard whatis harmful, to combine all that is valuable, in order to deter-mine precisely a number of immediate practical measures, and to carry out these measures at all costs, not hesitatingat any sacrifices.

 13, the manuscript March 2, 1920 INTERNATIONAL WORKING WOMEN ’S DAY Capitalism combines formal equality with economic and, consequently, social inequality. 
 That is one of the principal features of capitalism, one that is deliberately obscured by the supporters of the bourgeoisie, the liberals,and is not understood by petty-bourgeois democrats. 
 Thisfeature of capitalism, incidentally, renders it necessary forus in our resolute fight for economic equality openly toadmit capitalist inequality, and even, under certain con-ditions, to make this open admission of inequality the basis of the proletarian statehood (the Soviet Constitution). 
 But even in the matter of formal equality (equality be-fore the law, the “equality” of the well-fed and the hungry,of the man of property and the propertyless), capitalismcannot be consistent. 
 And one of the most glaring mani-festations of this inconsistency is the inequality of women. 
 Complete equality has not been granted even by the mostprogressive republican, and democratic bourgeois states. 
 The Soviet Republic of Russia, on the other hand, at once swept away all legislative traces of the inequality of women without exception, and immediately ensured their complete equality before the law. 
 It is said that the best criterion of the cultural level is the legal status of women. 
 This aphorism contains a grainof profound truth. 
 From this standpoint only the dictator-ship of the proletariat, only the socialist state could attain,as it has attained, the highest cultural level. 
 The new, mighty and unparalleled stimulus given to the working women’s movement is therefore inevitably associated withthe foundation (and consolidation) of the first Soviet Republic—and, in addition to and in connection with this, with the Communist International. 
 Since mention has been made of those who were oppressed by capitalism, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part,it must be said that the Soviet system, and only the Sovietsystem, guarantees democracy. 
 This is clearly shown bythe position of the working class and the poor peasants. 
 Itis clearly shown by the position of women. 
 But the Soviet system is the last decisive struggle for the abolition of classes , for economic and social equality. 
 De-mocracy, even democracy for those who were oppressed bycapitalism, including the oppressed sex, is not enough for us . 
 It is the chief task of the working women’s movement to fight for economic and social equality, and not only formal equality, for women. 
 The chief thing is to get women to take part in socially productive labour, to liberate them from“domestic slavery”, to free them from their stupefying andhumiliating subjugation to the eternal drudgery of thekitchen and the nursery. 
 This struggle will be a long one, and it demands a radical reconstruction both of social technique and of morals. 
 But it will end in the complete triumph of communism.

 Lenin SPEECH DELIVERED AT A MEETING OF THE MOSCOW SOVIET OF WORKERS ’ AND RED ARMY DEPUTIES MARCH 6, 1920 Comrades, I very much regret that there is little proba-bility of my being able to discharge the duties hinted atby the Chairman in reference to my membership of theMoscow Soviet. 
 134 I am nevertheless very glad to have the opportunity of greeting the new Moscow Soviet. 
 Permit me to say a few words about the tasks which, owing to the general situation in the country, fall particularly to the lotof the Moscow workers, and first and foremost of the MoscowSoviet. 
 Comrades, it seems there is every hope that we shall, in the near future, emerge completely victorious from the war which was forced upon us by the landowners and capitalists of Russia in alliance with the capitalists of the whole world. 
I have just received a telegram from a member of theRevolutionary Military Council of the Caucasian Front, thelast remaining front of any importance. 
 This telegram statesthat the resistance of the enemy has been broken in all directions ( applause ), so that now that we have finished with the Kolchak front and the Archangel front, the day isapparently not far off when the Denikin front, too, will becompletely eliminated. 
 But, comrades, no matter how greatlythe results of the Civil War and the international situationmay favour us, and even though the imperialist powers are obviously on the eve of a complete breakdown, and all their attempts to unite anybody at all for a war againstus have ended in failure—no matter how favourable this situation may be, it must be said that the danger, even the foreign danger, is not yet over. 
 Attempts are still being made, especially by imperialist France, to incite Poland to make war on Russia. 
 You all know, of course, from the press,from the decisions of the Central Executive Committee,and from all the statements made at the Cossack Congressand many other congresses, that the Soviet Republic, onits part, has done all it could to prevent this war, that we have proposed peace to the Polish nation not only officially but in the most friendly way, and have most solemnly rec-ognised the independence of the Polish state, and havemade the most positive declarations to this effect. 
 From themilitary standpoint, we have done everything we could toprevent the Polish landowners and capitalists from carrying out their designs—perhaps not so much their own designs as those of imperialist France, who stands behind theirback and to whom they are up to their ears in debt. 
 Wehave done everything we could to prevent these capitalistsand landowners from carrying out their design of incitingthe Polish nation to make war on Russia. 
 But although we have done everything we could, future action does not depend upon us. 
 Even the Polish landowners and capitaliststhemselves do not know what they will do tomorrow. 
 Theinternal situation in Poland is so grave that they mayembark on such a dubious venture because of the obviousdanger to their class position, because they feel their end approaching. 
 Consequently, although we have won many victories, we have no guarantee at all that we are secureagainst foreign attack, and we must be on our guard, wemust preserve, develop and strengthen our military pre-paredness, so as to accomplish the task that confronts theworking class. 
 If, in spite of all our efforts, the Polish imperialists, supported by France, embark on a war against Russia, if they launch their military venture, they mustreceive, and will receive, such a rebuff that their fragilecapitalism and imperialism will fall to pieces. 
 We do not conceal from ourselves, especially from the Moscow and other Russian workers, that fresh effort and new and gigantic sacrifices are now demanded of us, which will be all the more severe because we are just now at theend of a winter—February and March—that has brought a new aggravation of want, hunger and suffering owing to the ruined state of our railway system. 
 And I must tell you that the war on the bloody front, the civil war directed against the imperialists, is to all appearances coming toan end, and that anyway the enemy can offer no seriousmenace to us since the attempts of the Entente to launcha general war against us have suffered decisive defeat; thewar on the bloodless front, however, still continues and will continue for a long time to come. 
 For the more we leave the military danger behind us the more we are faced withthe tasks of internal development; and these have to becarried out by the working class, which has taken uponitself the mission of leading the working masses. 
 Thesetasks—the restoration of a ruined country and a ruined economy, and the organisation of a socialist society—cannot be accomplished without a war on the bloodless front. 
 Thatis what the advanced workers, who are now forming the newMoscow Soviet, must impress most firmly on their minds,for the Moscow workers have always been a model, and forsome time to come must continue to be a model, which will be followed by the workers of other cities. 
 We must remember that we are grappling with the task of making a socialist revolution in a country where peasantsform the greater part of the population. 
 We have now beenjoined by the peasant masses of Siberia, where the peasantshave surpluses of grain, where they have been corrupted by capitalism, cling to the old freedom of trade, and consider it their sacred right—in this respect they are being ledastray by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries(that is their sad lot—there is nothing else for them to do)—they consider it their sacred right to practise freedom oftrade in grain surpluses, believing that they can retain this right. 
 It does not matter to them that this supposed civil equality implies the exploitation of the hungry by thewell-fed; for peasants who have grain surpluses and refuseto let the starving have them are putting into effect theprinciples of capitalist relations. 
 They are people who,after having been exploited for hundreds of years, have now become their own masters for the first time, and are in a position, owing to their grain surpluses, to enslave theworkers, who, as a result of the collapse of industry, are unable to give any equivalent in return for the grain. 
 For this reason our attitude towards these petty-bourgeois property-owners, towards the small profiteers, who number millions and who think that because they possess surplusesof grain the farther we go the more they will make, and thatthe worse the famine the more profitable it will be for thosewho have grain—our attitude towards them must be one ofwar. 
 This we say bluntly, and this is the basis of the dicta-torship of the proletariat, which openly declares to the work-er and peasant masses: “The working peasant is our ally,our friend and brother; but when the peasant acts as a prop-erty-owner holding a surplus of grain not required by hishousehold, and acts towards us as a property-owner, as awell-fed man towards a hungry man, such a peasant is our enemy, and we will fight him with the utmost determina-tion, the utmost ruthlessness. 
” Victory over the small prop-erty-owners, over the small profiteers, is no easy matter. 
They cannot be eliminated in one year, many years willbe required; it will take organised resistance, stubbornand steadfast work, step by step over a long period of time— it will take an incessant day-to-day struggle, which it is particularly difficult to wage and in which the profiteeringpeasant is very often victorious over the worker. 
 But wewill fight on the bloodless front so that the hungry maysecure from the well-fed the surpluses they possess,despite all obstacles and despite the desire of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks to introduce freedom of trade and leave these surpluses in the possessionof the well-fed. 
 We have done a great deal of work during the past two years. 
 We have enlisted the peasant and worker masses inthis work, and have everywhere been able to secure what we needed. 
 At a time when the whiteguard officers, the former tsarist officers, were fighting us on the side of our enemies,we enlisted tens and hundreds of these experts in our work,which helped to remake them. 
 They helped us do our work,in conjunction with our commissars. 
 They themselveslearned from us how the work should be done, and in return gave us the benefit of their technical knowledge. 
 And it was only with their help that the Red Army was able to win thevictories it did. 
 We must now divert all this work into another channel. 
 It must be work of a peaceful character; we must devote everything to the work on the labour front. 
 We must direct our former property-owners, who were our enemies. 
 We must mobilise all who are capable of workingand compel them to work with us. 
 We must at all costswipe from the face of the earth the last traces of the policyof the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries—the policywhich talks of personal freedom, etc. 
—because it would doom us to starvation. 
 This attitude must be adopted in all our work. 
 The advanced section of the proletariat is assumingthe leadership of the rest of the population, and it says: “Wemust get you to understand our ideas fully and to put theminto effect, just as we got you to come over more and more toour side. 
” The first task that confronts us here is to clean up Moscow, to put an end to the filth and state of neglectinto which it has sunk. 
 We must do this so as to set an exam-ple to the whole country, where this filth, which bringswith it epidemics and disease, is becoming more and moreprevalent. 
 We must set this example here, in Moscow, an example such as Moscow has set many times before. 
 We must bear in mind that we are faced with the task of restoring the transport system. 
 In the spring we must intro-duce control by the worker masses. 
 We must effect it inrespect of those market gardeners in the vicinity of Moscowwho are taking advantage of the fact that there are starving fellow-beings around them to pocket millions. 
 The fact that any rich market gardener can squeeze untold profits out ofhis poor neighbours is an atrocious injustice, which wecannot tolerate. 
 What must we do? Specialists must give us the benefit of their knowledge so that we may carry our ideas into effect. 
 The class which has just elected the new Moscow Soviet must tackle this work, and carry it out more practi-cally and in greater detail than hitherto. 
 We know that the proletariat is not very large numeri-cally; but we also know that the Petrograd workers, whowere in the front ranks of the Red Army, gave us their best forces whenever we needed them, gave them for the fight against the enemy in greater numbers than we thoughtpossible. 
 We have said that Petrograd, Moscow and Ivanovo-Voznesensk have given us a vast number of people. 
 But that is not enough; they must give us all we need. 
 We have to utilise all the bourgeois specialists who accumulated knowledge in the past and who must pay with this knowledgenow. 
 It is with the help of these people that we must do ourwork; it is with their help that we must conquer all we need—conquer, and create our own militant contingents of workerswho will learn from them and direct them, and who will always turn to the broad masses of the workers to explain this experience. 
 That is what the Moscow Soviet, as one ofthe most important and one of the biggest of the proletarianSoviets, must accomplish at all costs. 
 The fifteen hundredmembers of the Moscow Soviet, plus the alternate members,constitute an apparatus through which you can draw upon the masses and constantly enlist them, inexperienced though they are, in the work of administering the state. 
 The worker and peasant masses who have to build up our entire state must start by organising state control. 
 Youwill obtain this apparatus from among the worker and peas-ant masses, from among the young workers and peasants who have been fired as never before with the independent desire, the readiness and determination to set about thework of administering the state themselves. 
 We have learnedfrom the experiences of the war and shall promote thousandsof people who have passed through the school of the Sovietsand are capable of governing the state. 
 You must recruit the most diffident and undeveloped, the most timid of the workers for the workers’ inspection and promote them. 
 Letthem progress in this work. 
 When they have seen how theworkers’ inspection participates in state affairs, let themgradually proceed from the simple duties they are able tocarry out—at first only as onlookers—to more important functions of state. 
 You will secure a flow of assistants from the widest sources who will take upon themselves theburden of government, who will come to lend a hand andto work. 
 We need tens of thousands of new advancedworkers. 
 Turn for support to the non-party workers andpeasants, turn to them, for our Party must remain a narrow party, surrounded as it is by enemies on all sides. 
 At a time when hostile elements are trying by every method ofwarfare, deceit and provocation to cling to us and to take advantage of the fact that membership of a government party offers certain privileges, we must act in contact with the non-party people. 
 The laws on the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection grant the right to enlist non-party workers andpeasants and their conferences in the work of government. 
This apparatus is one of the means whereby we can increasethe number of workers and peasants who will help us toachieve victory on the internal front in a few years. 
 For a long time this victory will not be as simply, decisively and clearly apparent as the victory on the war front. 
 Thisvictory demands vigilance and effort, and you can ensureit by carrying out the job of development of Moscow and itsenvirons and helping in the general work of restoring thetransport system, of restoring that general economic organi-sation which will help us to get rid of the direct and indi-rect influence of the profiteers and to vanquish the oldtraditions of capitalism. 
 We should not grudge a few yearsfor this. 
 Even if we had these conditions, such social re-forms as these would be without parallel, and here to setourselves tasks designed only for a short period of time would be a great mistake. 
 Allow me to conclude by expressing the hope and assur-ance that the new Moscow Soviet, bearing in mind all theexperience gained by its predecessor in the course of theCivil War, will draw new forces from among the youth andwill tackle the affairs of economic development with all the energy, firmness and persistence with which we tackled military affairs, and so gain victories which, if not as bril-liant, will be more solid and substantial. 
 Published in 1921 in Published according to Verbatim Reports of the the book Plenary Sessions of the Moscow Soviet of Workers ’, Peasants ’ and Red Army Deputies , Moscow SPEECH AT A MEETING OF THE MOSCOW SOVIET IN CELEBRATION OF THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL MARCH 6, 1920 Comrades, a year has passed since the founding of the Communist International. 
 During this year the CommunistInternational has been successful beyond all expectation;we may say boldly that at the time of its foundation no oneexpected such immense successes. 
 In the early period of the revolution many entertained the hope that the socialist revolution would begin in WesternEurope immediately the imperialist war ended; at the timewhen the masses were armed there could have been a suc-cessful revolution in some of the Western countries as well. 
It could have taken place, had it not been for the split within the proletariat of Western Europe being deeper and the treachery of the former socialist leaders greater than hadbeen imagined. 
 To this day we lack exact information on how the demo-bilisation proceeded and how the war is being wound up. 
We do not know, for example, what happened in Holland, and only from an article containing an account of a Dutch Communist’s speech (from one chance article—there weremany such articles) have I been able to learn that the revo-lutionary movement in Holland, a neutral country that wasless involved in the imperialist war, assumed such dimensionsthat the formation of Soviets was started, and Troelstra, one of the most important figures in the opportunist Dutch Social-Democratic Party, admitted that the workerscould have seized power. 
 Had the International not been in the hands of traitors who worked to save the bourgeoisie at the critical moment, there would have been many chances of a speedy revolution in many belligerent countries as soon as the war ended andalso in some neutral countries, where the people were armed;then the outcome would have been different. 
 Things did not turn out that way, revolution did not succeed so quickly, and it now has to follow the whole path of development that we began even before the first revolu-tion, before 1905; for it was only due to more than ten yearshaving passed before 1917 that we were capable of leadingthe proletariat. 
 What happened in 1905 was, so to speak, a rehearsal for the revolution, and it was partly because of this that we in Russia succeeded in using the moment of the collapse of the-imperialist war for the proletariat to seize power. 
 Owingto historical developments, owing to the utter rottennessof the autocracy, we were able to begin the revolution withease; but the easier it was to begin it the harder it hasbeen for this solitary country to continue it, and with the experience of this year behind us we can say to ourselves that in other countries, where the workers are more devel-oped, where there is more industry, where the workers arefar more numerous, the revolution has developed moreslowly. 
 It has taken our path, but at a much slower pace. 
 The workers are continuing this slow development, paving the way for the proletarian victory which is advancing with undoubtedly greater speed than was the case with us;because when you look at the Third International you won-der that it has spread so rapidly, moving from success tosuccess. 
 Look at the way our ugly words, such as “Bolshevism”, for example, are spreading throughout the world. 
 Despite the fact that we call ourselves the Communist Party, andthat the name “Communist” is a scientific, European term,it is not as widespread in European and other countries asthe word “Bolshevik” is. 
 Our Russian word “Soviet” is oneof the most widely used, it is not even translated into other languages, but is pronounced everywhere in Russian. 
 Despite the lies in the bourgeois press, despite the furious resistance offered by the entire bourgeoisie, the sympathies of the masses of the workers are on the side of the Soviets, Soviet power and Bolshevism. 
 The more the bourgeoisie lied the more they helped to spread throughout the world what we had experienced with Kerensky. 
 On their arrival from Germany, some of the Bolsheviks were met here with attacks and persecutions, organised inthe “democratic republic” in real American style. 
 Kerensky,the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks did their best to assist this witch-hunt. 
 In this way they stirred up sections of the proletariat and made them think that theremust be something good about the Bolsheviks if they aresubjected to such persecution. 
 ( Applause . 
) And when you get fragmentary information from abroad from time to time, when—being unable to follow the entire press—you read, for example, Britain’s richest newspaper, The Times , and find it quoting Bolshevik statements to prove that during the war the Bolsheviks were preachingcivil war, you draw the conclusion that even the cleverestrepresentatives of the bourgeoisie have completely losttheir heads. 
 This British newspaper directs attention to the book Against the Stream , recommends it to British readers and gives quotations to show that the Bolsheviks are thevery worst of people, who speak of the criminal characterof the imperialist war and preach civil war; it convinces youthat the entire bourgeoisie, while they hate us, arehelping us—and we bow to them and thank them. 
 (Applause . 
) We have no daily press either in Europe or in America; information about our work is very meagre, and our com-rades are suffering the most severe persecution. 
 But whenyou see that the very wealthy Allied imperialist press, fromwhich hundreds of thousands of other newspapers draw their information, has lost its sense of proportion to such a degree that in its desire to injure the Bolsheviks it prints numerousquotations from the writings of Bolsheviks, digging themup from war-time publications in order to prove that wespoke of the criminal character of the war and worked totransform it into a civil war, it shows that these very clever gentlemen will become as stupid as our Kerensky and his comrades were. 
 We can therefore vouch for it that thesepeople, the leaders of British imperialism, will make a clean and enduring job of helping the communist revolution. 
 (Applause . 
) Comrades, before the war it seemed that the main divi-sion in the working-class movement was the division intosocialists and anarchists. 
 Not only did it seem so; it wasso. 
 In the protracted period that preceded the imperialistwar and the revolution, no objective revolutionary situa-tion existed in the overwhelming majority of European countries. 
 What had to be done at that time was to use this slow process for revolutionary preparation. 
 The socialistsbegan it, but the anarchists did not see the need for it. 
 Thewar created a revolutionary situation, and the old divisionproved to be outdated. 
 On the one hand, the top leaders ofanarchism and socialism became chauvinists; they showed what it meant to defend their own bourgeois robbers against other bourgeois robbers, both of whom were responsible forthe loss of millions of lives in the war. 
 On the other hand, newtrends arose among the rank and file of the old parties—against the war, against imperialism and for social revolu-tion. 
 A most profound crisis thus developed owing to the war; both the anarchists and the socialists split, because the parliamentary leaders of the socialists were in the chau-vinist wing while an ever-growing minority of the rankand file left them and began to take the side of therevolution. 
 Thus the working-class movement in all countries followed a new line, not the line of the anarchists and the socialists, but one that could lead to the dictatorship of the prole-tariat. 
 This split had become apparent throughout the worldand had started before the Third International was founded. 
 If our party has been successful it is because it came into being when the situation was revolutionary and when the labour movement was already in existence in all countries; and we therefore see now that a split has taken place insocialism and anarchism. 
 All over the world, this is leadingto communist workers participating in the formation of neworganisations and to their uniting in the Third International. 
That is the most correct attitude. 
 Disagreements are again arising, for example, over the question of using parliaments, but since the experience ofthe Russian revolution and the Civil War, since the figure of Liebknecht and his role and importance among parlia-mentarians, have become known to the world, it is absurd to reject the revolutionary use of parliaments. 
 It has become clear to people of the old way of thinking that the questionof the state cannot be presented in the old way, that the old,bookish approach to this question has been succeeded bya new one based on practice and born of the revolutionarymovement. 
 A united and centralised force of the proletariat must be counterposed to the united and centralised force of thebourgeoisie. 
 The question of the state has thus now beenshifted to a new plane, and the old disagreement has begunto lose its meaning. 
 The old division of the working-classmovement has yielded to new ones, the attitude towards Soviet government and to the dictatorship of the prole-tariat having assumed prime importance. 
 The Soviet Constitution is clear evidence of what the Russian revolution has produced. 
 Our experience and thestudy of it have shown that all the groups of the old issuesare now reduced to one: for or against Soviet rule, either for bourgeois rule, for democracy (for those forms of democracy which promise equality between the well-fed and the hungry,equality between the capitalist and the worker at theballot-box, between the exploiters and the exploited, andserve to camouflage capitalist slavery), or for proletarianrule, for the ruthless suppression of the exploiters, for the Soviet state. 
 Only supporters of capitalist slavery can favour bour-geois democracy. 
 We can see that in the whiteguard litera-ture of Kolchak and Denikin. 
 Many Russian cities have beencleared of this filth, and the literature collected and sentto Moscow. 
 When you scan the writings of Russian intel-lectuals like Chirikov, or of bourgeois thinkers like Y. 
 Tru-betskoi, it is interesting to see that they help Denikin andat the same time argue about the Constituent Assembly,equality, etc. 
 These arguments about the Constituent Assem-bly are of service to us; when they conducted this propagandaamong the whiteguard rank and file they helped us in the same way as the entire course of the Civil War, all the events, helped us. 
 By their own arguments they proved thatSoviet rule is backed by sincere revolutionaries who sympathise with the struggle against the capitalists. 
 That has been made perfectly clear during the Civil War. 
 After the experience gained, after what has happened in Russia, Finland and Hungary, after a year’s experiencein the democratic republics, in Germany, one cannot objectto, and write disquisitions about, the need for a centralauthority, for dictatorship and a united will to ensure thatthe vanguard of the proletariat shall close its ranks, de-velop the state and place it upon a new footing, while firmly holding the reins of power. 
 Democracy has completelyexposed itself; that is why signs of the strengtheningof the communist movement for Soviet rule, for the dictator-ship of the proletariat, have increased tremendously in allcountries and have taken on the most diverse forms. 
 This has reached a point where such parties as the German Independents and the French Socialist Party, which aredominated by leaders of the old type who have failed tounderstand either the new propaganda or the new conditions,and have not in the least changed their parliamentary activi-ty, but are turning it into a means of dodging important issues and engaging the workers’ attention with parliamen-tary debates—even these leaders have to recognise thedictatorship of the proletariat and Soviet power. 
 This isbecause the masses of the workers are making themselvesfelt and forcing them to recognise it. 
 You know from the speeches of other comrades that the breakaway of the German Party of Independents, the recogni-tion of the dictatorship of the proletariat and of Sovietgovernment was the last decisive blow dealt to the SecondInternational. 
 Taking the existing state of affairs intoconsideration, it may be said that the Second Internationalhas been killed, and that the proletarian masses in Germany, Britain and France are taking the side of the Communists. 
 In Britain there is also a party of Independents which per-sists in adhering to legality and in condemning the violenceof the Bolsheviks. 
 A discussion forum was recently openedin their newspaper. 
 Well, the question of Soviets is beingdiscussed there, and next to an article printed in British working-class newspapers we see an article by an Englishman who refuses to reckon with the theory of socialism and per-sists in his stupid contempt for theory, but who, taking the conditions of life in Britain into consideration, reaches a definite conclusion and says that they cannot condemn the Soviets, but should support them. 
 This shows that things have begun to change even among the backward sections of the workers in countries like Brit-ain, and it may be said that the old forms of socialism havebeen killed for ever. 
 Europe is not moving towards revolution the way we did, although essentially Europe is going through the same experience. 
 In its own way, every country must go through,and has begun to go through, an internal struggle againstits own Mensheviks and against its own opportunists andSocialist-Revolutionaries, which exist under different namesto a greater or lesser degree in all countries. 
 And it is because they are experiencing this independently that we can be sure the victory of the communist revolutionin all countries is inevitable and that the greater the vacilla-tions in the enemies’ ranks, and the uncertainty in theirdeclarations that the Bolsheviks are criminals and that theywill never conclude peace with them, the better for us. 
 They are now saying that even if they do trade with the Bolsheviks they will not recognise them. 
 We have nothingagainst that; try it, gentlemen, please. 
 As for your not recog-nising us, we can understand that. 
 We would consider ita mistake on your part if you did recognise us. 
 But if youhave become so muddled that you first declare that the Bol-sheviks are violators of all the laws of God and man, and that you will not talk or make peace with them, and thensay that you will begin exchanges, without recognising ourpolicy, that is a victory for us which will give an impulseto and strengthen the communist movement among themasses in every country. 
 So deep is the movement that, in addition to those that are officially affiliated to the Third International, a number of movements are to be seen in theadvanced countries, movements that do not adhere either tosocialism or communism, but which are being drawntowards Bolshevism by the force of circumstances althoughthey continue to condemn it. 
 War in the twentieth century, in a civilised country, com-pels governments to expose their own actions. 
 A Frenchnewspaper has published some documents belonging to the ex-Emperor Charles of Austria who in 1916 offered peace to France. 
 Now that his letter has been published, the workers are asking Albert Thomas, the socialist leader, who was in the government at the time, what he did when an offer ofpeace-was made to that government. 
 When Albert Thomaswas asked about it, he made no reply. 
 These exposures have only just begun. 
 The masses of the people are literate, and neither in Europe nor in America can they retain the old attitude towards war. 
 They are asking for what cause 10 million people were killed and 20 millioncrippled. 
 The presentation of this question makes the popu-lar masses turn towards the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
To present this question is to answer it: 10 million peoplewere killed and 20 million crippled in order to settle the issue of who would amass the greater wealth, the German or the British capitalists. 
 That is the truth, and no matterwhat efforts are made to conceal it, it is spreading. 
 The fall of the capitalist governments is unavoidable, because everybody can see that another war like the lastis inevitable if the imperialists and the bourgeoisie remain in power. 
 New disputes and conflicts are developing between Japan and America. 
 They have been prepared by decades inthe diplomatic history of the two countries. 
 Wars areinevitable because of private property. 
 War is inevitablebetween Britain, which has acquired colonies throughplunder, and France, which considers herself robbed of her full share. 
 No one knows where and how it will break out, but everybody sees, knows and says that war is inevitable,and is being prepared again. 
 This situation in the twentieth century, in countries with a totally literate population, is our guarantee that the oldreformism and anarchism are out of the question. 
 They were killed by the war. 
 To talk of using reforms in order to remake the capitalist society which spent thousands ofmillions of rubles on the war, to talk of remaking thissociety without a revolutionary government and withoutforce, without tremendous upheavals, is impermissible. 
Anyone who speaks and thinks that way is of no importance. 
 The Communist International is strong because it is based on the lessons of the world imperialist slaughter. 
 In everycountry the correctness of its position finds increasing con-firmation in the experience of millions of people, and the movement towards the Communist International is now a hundred times wider and deeper than before. 
 It has brought about the complete break-down of the Second Internationalin one year. 
 In every country (even the most undeveloped) in the world, all thinking workers are aligning themselves with the Com-munist International, and are accepting its ideas. 
 Therein lies the full guarantee that the victory of the Communist International throughout the world, in the not very distantfuture, is assured.

 Lenin SPEEC H DELIVERE D AT THE THIR D ALL-RUSSIA CONGRES S OF WATE R TRANSPOR T WORKER S135 MARCH 15, 1920 The water transport system is at the moment of the great-est importance and significance to Soviet Russia, and the Congress will certainly devote the most serious attention and care to the tasks that confront water transport workers. 
Allow me to dwell on the question which the CommunistParty and the trade unions are more interested in than inany other, and which you too no doubt are keenly debating;I refer to the management of industry. 
 This question figures as a special point on the agenda of the Party Congress. 
 Theses on the subject are being published. 
 The comradesin the water transport system must also discuss it. 
 You know that one of the points in dispute, one that arouses the liveliest discussion both in the press and at meet-ings, is that of one-man management or corporate manage-ment. 
 I think that the preference for corporate management not infrequently betrays an inadequate comprehension ofthe tasks confronting the Republic; what is more, it oftentestifies to insufficient class-consciousness. 
 When I reflecton this question, I always feel like saying that the workershave not yet learned enough from the bourgeoisie. 
 This is graphically shown by the countries where the democratic socialists, or Social-Democrats, prevail, who are now parti-cipating in governments in Europe and America, undervarious guises and in some form of alliance with the bour-geoisie. 
 They have been ordained by God himself to sharethe old prejudices; but in our country, after two years of proletarian rule, we should not only want, but should strive to inculcate upon the proletariat a class-consciousness thatdoes not fall short of that of the bourgeoisie. 
 Look how the bourgeoisie administer the state; how they have organised the bourgeois class. 
 In the old days, could you have found anyone who shared the views of the bourgeoisie and was their loyal defender, and yet argued that individual authori-ty is incompatible with the administration of the state?If there had been such a blockhead among the bourgeoisiehe would have been laughed to scorn by his own class fellows,and would not have been allowed to talk or hold forth at any important meeting of capitalists and bourgeois. 
 They would have asked him what the question of administrationthrough one person or through a corporate body had to dowith the question of class. 
 The shrewdest and richest bourgeoisies are the British and American; the British are in many respects more experi-enced, and they know how to rule better than the Americans. 
 And do they not furnish us with examples of maximum indi-vidual dictatorship, of maximum speed in administration,and yet they keep the power fully and entirely in the handsof their own class? There you have a lesson, comrades, andI think that if you give it some thought, if you recall the not very distant past, when the Ryabushinskys, Morozovs and other capitalists ruled Russia—if you recall how, after theoverthrow of the autocracy, during the eight months Ke-rensky, the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionarieswere in power, they managed so perfectly and with suchremarkable rapidity to change their hue, to assume every kind of label, to make every kind of outward, formal con-cession, and yet keep the power fully and completely in thehands of their own class—I think that a little reflection onthe lesson of Britain and on this concrete example will domuch more to help understand the matter of one-manmanagement than many abstract, purely theoretical resolu-tions, compiled in advance. 
 It is claimed that corporate management means manage-ment by the workers, and that individual management meansnon-worker management. 
 The mere fact that the question ispresented in this way, the mere fact that this sort of argu-ment is used shows that we still lack a sufficiently clear class-consciousness; and not only so, but that we are less clear about our class interests than the bourgeois gentryare. 
 And that is natural. 
 They did not learn to rule in two years, but in two hundred years, and much more than two hundred years if you take the European bourgeoisie. 
 We must not give way to despair because we have been unable to learn everything in two years; but it is important—eventsdemand it—that we should learn more rapidly than ourenemies have. 
 They have had hundreds of years to learnin; they have opportunities to learn all over again and cor-rect their mistakes, because on a world scale they are infinitely stronger than we are. 
 We have no time to learn; we must approach the question of corporate managementfrom the standpoint of positive and concrete facts. 
 I amsure you will come to adopt the policy on this question out-lined by the Central Committee of the Party; it has beenpublished and is being discussed at every Party meeting, but for the men on the job, for the water transport workers, who have been at it for two years the truth of this isobvious. 
 And I hope the vast majority of those present here,who are familiar with practical management, will under-stand that we must not confine ourselves to a general discus-sion of the question, but must act like serious practical men, abolishing the collegiums and managing without them. 
 All administrative work requires special qualifications. 
 You may be the very best of revolutionaries and propagan-dists, and yet be absolutely useless as an administrator. 
 Butanybody who studies real life and has practical experienceknows that management necessarily implies competency, that a knowledge of all the conditions of production down to the last detail and of the latest technology of your branchof production is required; you must have had a certainscientific training. 
 These are the conditions we must satisfyat any cost. 
 And when we move general resolutions in whichwe talk with the pomposity of experts about corporate management and one-man management, the conviction gradu-ally dawns upon us that we know practically nothing aboutmanagement, but we are beginning to learn a little fromexperience, to weigh every step and to promote everyadministrator who shows any ability. 
 You know from the debates in the Central Committee that we are not opposed to placing workers at the head, but we say that this question must be settled in the interests ofproduction. 
 We cannot wait. 
 The country is so badly ruined, /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR calamities—famine, cold and general want—have reached such a pitch that we cannot continue like this any longer. 
 No devotion, no self-sacrifice can save us if we do not keep the workers alive, if we do not provide them with bread, ifwe do not succeed in procuring large quantities of salt, soas to recompense the peasants by properly organisedexchange and not with pieces of coloured paper which cannotkeep us going for long. 
 The very existence of the power of the workers and peasants, the very existence of Soviet Russia is at stake. 
 With management in the hands of in-competent people, with fuel not delivered in time, withlocomotives, steamers and barges standing unrepaired, thevery existence of Soviet Russia is at stake. 
 Our rail transport system is in a far worse state than our water transport system. 
 It has been ruined by the Civil War, which was mainly conducted along the land routes;both sides destroyed mostly bridges, and this has put thewhole railway system in a desperate state of ruin. 
 We shallrestore it. 
 Almost daily we are doing a little bit towardsrestoring it. 
 But it will be some time before the system is completely restored. 
 If even advanced and cultured countries are suffering from disrupted transport systems,how are we to restore ours in Russia? But repaired itmust be, and quickly, for the population cannot endureanother winter like the last. 
 Whatever the heroism of theworkers, whatever their spirit of self-sacrifice, they cannot go on enduring all the torments of hunger, cold, typhus and so on. 
 So tackle the question of management like prac-tical men. 
 See to it that management is conducted with theminimum expenditure of forces; see to it that the adminis-trators, whether experts or workers, are capable men,that they all work and manage, and let it be considered a crime for them not to take part in the work of management. 
 Learn from your own practical experience. 
 Learn from thebourgeoisie as well. 
 They knew how to maintain their classrule; they have the experience we cannot do without and toignore it would be sheer conceit and entail the utmost dangerto the revolution. 
 Earlier revolutions perished because the workers were unable to retain power by means of a firm dictatorship anddid not realise that they could not retain power by dicta-torship, by force, by coercion alone; power can be maintained only by adopting the whole experience of cultured, techni-cally-equipped, progressive capitalism and by enlisting the services of all these people. 
 When workers undertaking thejob of management for the first time adopt an unfriendlyattitude towards the expert, the bourgeois, the capitalistwho only recently was a director, who raked in millions andoppressed the workers, we say—and no doubt the majority of you also say—that these workers have only just begun to move towards communism. 
 If communism could be built withexperts who were not imbued with the bourgeois outlook, thatwould be very easy; but such communism is a myth. 
 Weknow that nothing drops from the skies; we know that com-munism grows out of capitalism and can be built only from its remnants, they are bad remnants, it is true, but there are no others. 
 Whoever dreams of a mythical communismshould be driven from every business conference, and onlythose should be allowed to remain who know how to getthings done with the remnants of capitalism. 
 There aretremendous difficulties in the work, but it is fruitful work, and every expert must be treasured as being the only ve-hicle of technology and culture, without whom therecan be nothing, without whom there can be no communism. 
 Our Red Army was victorious in another sphere because we solved this problem in relation to the Red Army. 
 Thou-sands of former officers, generals, and colonels of the tsarist army betrayed and sold us, and thousands of the finest Red Army men perished as a result—that you know. 
 But tensof thousands are serving us although they remain supportersof the bourgeoisie, and without them there would have beenno Red Army. 
 And you know that when two years ago wetried to create a Red Army without them, it ended in guer-rilla methods and disorder; the result was that our ten to twelve million soldiers did not make up a single division. 
There was not a single division fit to fight, and with ourmillions of soldiers we were unable to cope with the tinyregular army of the whiteguards. 
 We learned this lesson atthe cost of much bloodshed, and it must now be applied to industry. 
 Experience tells us that everyone with a knowledge of bourgeois culture, bourgeois science and bourgeois technology must be treasured. 
 Without them we shall be unable to build communism. 
 The working class, as a class, rules; it created Soviet power, holds that power as a class, and can take every supporter of bourgeois interests and fling himout neck and crop. 
 Therein lies the strength of the proleta-riat. 
 But if we are to build a communist society, let us franklyadmit our complete inability to conduct affairs, to beorganisers and administrators. 
 We must approach the matter with the greatest caution, bearing in mind that only that proletarian is class-conscious who is able to prepare thebourgeois expert for the forthcoming navigation season andwho does not waste his time and energy, more than enough ofwhich is always wasted on corporate management. 
 I repeat, our fate may depend more on the forthcoming navigation season than on the forthcoming war with Poland, if it is forced upon us. 
 War too, you know, is hampered bythe break-down of the transport system. 
 We have plenty oftroops, but we cannot transport them, we cannot supply themwith food; we cannot bring up salt, of which we have largequantities, and without an exchange of goods, proper rela-tions with the peasants are inconceivable. 
 That is why the entire Republic, Soviet power as a whole, the very exist-ence of the power of the workers and peasants, imposes on thepresent navigation season tasks of great and exceptionalimportance. 
 Not one week, not one day, not one minute mustbe lost; we must put an end to this chaos and increase our possibilities three- and fourfold. 
 Everything, perhaps, depends on fuel, but the fuel situ-ation is now better than it was last year. 
 We can float moretimber, if we do not allow mismanagement. 
 Things are muchbetter with regard to oil, to say nothing of the fact that inthe near future Grozny will most likely be in our hands; and although this is still problematical, the Emba fields are ours, and there we have ten to fourteen million poods ofoil already. 
 And if the water transport system helps us todeliver large quantities of building material to Saratovquickly and in good time, we shall cope with the railway tothe Emba fields. 
 And you know what it means to have oil for the water transport system. 
 We shall not be able to get the railways going in a short time. 
 God grant—not God, ofcourse, but our ability to overcome the old prejudices of the workers—that we improve the railways a little in four or five months. 
 And so, the water transport system must carry out a task of heroic proportions during this year’s navigation period. 
 Dash, ardour and enthusiasm alone can do nothing; organisation, endurance and honest effort are what will help,when the loudest voice is not that of the man who fears thebourgeois expert and treats us to general talk, but thatof the man who is able to establish and to exercise firm authority—let it be even individual authority, provided it is used in the interests of the proletariat—and who realisesthat everything depends on the water transport system. 
 To make progress we must erect a ladder; in order to get the sceptical to climb that ladder, we must put thingsin order, we must select and promote people who are able to put the water transport system in order. 
 There are some who say in reference to military discipline: “The idea!What do we want it for?” Such people do not realise thesituation in Russia and do not realise that although thefight on the bloody front is coming to an end, the fight onthe bloodless front is only beginning, that no less effort, exertion and sacrifice is required here, and that the stakes are no smaller and the resistance greater rather than less. 
Every wealthy peasant, every kulak and every member ofthe old administration who does not want to act in the inter-ests of the workers is our enemy. 
 Do not cherish any illu-sions. 
 Victory demands a tremendous struggle and iron, military discipline. 
 Whoever does not understand this understands nothing about the conditions needed to maintainthe power of the workers, and his ideas do great harm to thispower of the workers and peasants. 
 That is why, comrades, I will conclude my speech by expressing the hope and certainty that you will devote the greatest attention to the tasks of the forthcoming navigation season, and will make it your aim, and will stop at no sacri-fice, to create real, iron, military discipline and to performin the sphere of water transport miracles as great as thoseperformed during the past two years by our Red Army.

 SVERDLO V136 MARCH 16, 1920 BRIEF NEWSPAPER REPORT Referring to the late Comrade Sverdlov’s great talent as an organiser, Lenin said that this reminded one of the significance of organisation and of the role of organisersin Soviet development. 
 Describing the extreme importance of organisation, Lenin pointed out that organisation was, in fact, the principal weapon of the working class in therevolutionary struggle. 
 He spoke of the alignment of socialforces at various periods since the October Revolution, anddeclared that the dictatorship of the proletariat would havebeen impossible had the working people not been united. 
 He drew the conclusion that organisation was the mainspring of all our successes on the war fronts, as well as of thesuccesses gradually being achieved in combating economicdisruption. 
 Lenin gave an appreciation from this angleof the work of the late Comrade Sverdlov as an organiser,and went on to say that we had such a vanguard of organ-isers because they had passed through a severe school of life when they had to work in underground organisations. 
 Such avanguard of organisers was particularly needed at that mo-ment in Germany, which was passing through a stage ofKornilovism. 
 Lenin said that there were many talentedorganisers among the working people, even among the non-party workers and peasants, but that we had not yet learned to find them and to place them in suitable posts. 
 Heexpressed the conviction that increasing numbers of organisers would in future emerge from among the working people, and that they would remember the work of Comrade Sverdlov and firmly follow in his footsteps.

 The troops of the landowners and capitalists who wanted, with the aid of the capitalists of the whole world, tore-establish their rule in Russia have been routed. 
 The imperialist war and then the war against counter-revolution, however, have laid waste to and ruined the entirecountry. 
 We must bend all efforts to conquer the chaos, to restore industry and agriculture, and to give the peasants the goodsthey need in exchange for grain. 
 Now that we have defeated the landowners and liberated Siberia, the Ukraine, and the North Caucasus, we have everyopportunity of restoring the country’s economy. 
 We have a lot of grain, and we now have coal and oil. 
 We are being held up by transport. 
 The railways are out ofaction. 
 Transport must be rehabilitated. 
 Then we can bring grain, coal and oil to the factories, then we can deliver salt, then we shall begin to restore industry and put an endto the hunger of the factory and railway workers. 
 Let all workers and peasants set about rehabilitating the railways, let them set about the work with persistenceand enthusiasm. 
 All the work necessary for the restoration of transport must be carried out with the greatest zeal, with revolution-ary fervour, with unreserved loyalty. 
 We have been victorious on the front of the bloody war.

Why are we confident that we shall now defeat the eco-nomic chaos and rehabilitate industry and agriculture? We overthrew the landowners and capitalists because the men of the Red Army, workers and peasants, knew they were fighting for their own vital interests. 
 We won because the best people from the entire working class and from the entire peasantry displayed unparalleledheroism in the war against the exploiters, performed miraclesof valour, withstood untold privations, made great sacri-fices and got rid of scroungers and cowards. 
 We are now confident that we shall conquer the chaos because the best people from the entire working class andfrom the entire peasantry are joining this struggle with thesame political consciousness, the same firmness and the sameheroism. 
 When millions of working people unite as one and follow the best people from their class, victory is assured. 
 We drove the scroungers out of the army. 
 And now we say, “Down with the scroungers, down with those who think oftheir own advantage, of speculation and of shirking work,those who are afraid of the sacrifices necessary for victory!” Long live labour discipline, zeal in work and loyalty to the cause of the workers and peasants! Eternal glory to those who died in the front ranks of the Red Army! Eternal glory to those who are now leading millions of working people and who with the greatest zeal march in the front ranks of the army of labour!

 the shorthand notes Moscow, 1920 1 OPENING SPEECH MARCH 29 First of all allow me on behalf of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party to greet the delegates who have assembled for the Party Congress. 
 Comrades, we are opening this present Congress of the Party at a highly important moment. 
 The internal develop-ment of our revolution has led to very big and rapid victoriesover the enemy in the Civil War, and, in view of the interna-tional situation, these victories, we find, are nothing more nor less than the victory of the Soviet revolution in thefirst country to make this revolution—a very weak and back-ward country—a victory over the combined forces of worldcapitalism and imperialism. 
 And after these victories we maynow proceed with calm and firm assurance to the immediate tasks of peaceful economic development, confident that the present Congress, having reviewed the experience of over twoyears of Soviet work, will be able to utilise the lesson gainedin order to cope with the more difficult and complex taskof economic development that now confronts us. 
 From theinternational standpoint, our position has never been as favourable as it is now; and what fills us with particular joy and vigour is the news we are daily receiving from Ger-many, which shows that, however difficult and painful thebirth of a socialist revolution may be, the proletarian Sovietpower in Germany is spreading irresistibly. 
 The part playedby the German Kornilov-type putsch was similar to that of Kornilov revolt in Russia. 
 After that a swing towards a workers’ government began, not only among the masses ofurban workers, but also among the rural proletariat of Ger-many. 
 And this swing is of historic importance. 
 Not only is it one more absolute confirmation of the correctness of the line, but it gives us the assurance that the time is not far off when we shall be marching hand in hand with a GermanSoviet government. 
 ( Applause . 
) I hereby open the Congress and request you to nominate a presidium. 
 2 REPORT OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE MARCH 29 Comrades, before beginning my report I must say that, like the report at the preceding Congress, it is divided into two parts: political and organisational. 
 This division firstof all leads one to think of the way the work of the CentralCommittee has developed in its external aspect, the organi-sational aspect. 
 Our Party has now been through its firstyear without Y. 
 M. 
 Sverdlov, and our loss was bound to tell on the whole organisation of the Central Committee. 
 No one has been able to combine organisational and politicalwork in one person so successfully as Comrade Sverdlovdid and we have been obliged to attempt to replace hiswork by the work of a collegium. 
 During the year under review the current daily work of the Central Committee has been conducted by the two collegi-ums elected by the plenary meeting of the Central Commit-tee—the Organising Bureau of the Central Committee andthe Political Bureau of the Central Committee. 
 In order toachieve co-ordination and consistency in the decisions ofthese two bodies, the Secretary was a member of both. 
 In practice it has become the main and proper function of the Organising Bureau to distribute the forces of the Party, andthat of the Political Bureau to deal with political questions. 
It goes without saying that this distinction is to a certainextent artificial; it is obvious that no policy can be carriedout in practice without finding expression in appointments and transfers. 
 Consequently, every organisational question assumes a political significance; and it has become the estab-lished practice for the request of a single member of the Central Committee to be sufficient to have any question, for one reason or another, examined as a political question. 
 To have attempted to divide the functions of the Central Committee in any other way would hardly have been expe-dient and in practice would hardly have achieved its purpose. 
 This method of conducting business has produced extreme-ly good results: no difficulties have arisen between the twobureaus on any occasion. 
 The work of these bodies has on the whole proceeded harmoniously, and practical implemen-tation has been facilitated by the presence of the Secretarywho acted, furthermore, solely and exclusively in pursuanceof the will of the Central Committee. 
 It must be emphasisedfrom the very outset, so as to remove all misunderstanding,that only the corporate decisions of the Central Committee adopted in the Organising Bureau or the Political Bureau, or by a plenary meeting of the Central Committee—onlythese decisions were carried out by the Secretary of theCentral Committee of the Party. 
 The work of the CentralCommittee cannot otherwise proceed properly. 
 After these brief remarks on the arrangement of work within the Central Committee, I shall get on with my job, which is the report of the Central Committee. 
 To present areport on the political work of the Central Committee is ahighly difficult task if understood literally. 
 A large partof the work of the Political Bureau has this year consistedin making the current decision on the various questions of policy that have arisen, questions of co-ordinating the activ-ities of all the Soviet and Party institutions and all organ-isations of the working class, of co-ordinating and doing theirutmost to direct the work of the entire Soviet Republic. 
 The Po-litical Bureau adopted decisions on all questions of foreign anddomestic policy. 
 Naturally, to attempt to enumerate these questions, even approximately, would be impossible. 
 You will find material for a general summary in the printed matterprepared by the Central Committee for this Congress. 
 Toattempt to repeat this summary in my report would be beyondmy powers, and I do not think it would be interesting to thedelegates. 
 All of us who work in a Party or Soviet organisa-tion keep daily track of the extraordinary succession of political questions, both foreign and domestic. 
 The waythese questions have been decided, as expressed in the decrees of the Soviet government, and in the activities of the Party organisations, at every turn, is in itself an evaluation of the Central Committee of the Party. 
 It must be said that the questions were so numerous that they frequently had to bedecided under conditions of extreme haste, and it was onlybecause the members of the body concerned were so well ac-quainted with each other, knew every shade of opinion andhad confidence in each other, that this work could be done at all. 
 Otherwise it would have been beyond the powers of a body even three times the size. 
 When deciding complex ques-tions it frequently happened that meetings had to be replacedby telephone conversations. 
 This was done in the full assur-ance that obviously complicated and disputed questionswould not be overlooked. 
 Now, when I am called upon to make a general report, instead of giving a chronological review and a grouping of subjects, I shall take the libertyof dwelling on the main and most essential points, such,moreover, as link up the experience of yesterday, or, morecorrectly, of the past year, with the tasks that nowconfront us. 
 The time is not yet ripe for a history of Soviet govern-ment. 
 And even if it were, I must say for myself—andI think for the Central Committee as well—that we have nointention of becoming historians. 
 What interests us is thepresent and the future. 
 We take the past year under reviewas material, as a lesson, as a stepping-stone, from which we must proceed further. 
 Regarded from this point of view, the work of the Central Committee falls into two big catego-ries—work connected with war problems and those deter-mining the international position of the Republic, andwork of internal, peace-time economic development, whichonly began to come to the fore at the end of the last year perhaps, or the beginning of this year, when it became quite clear that we had won a decisive victory on the deci-sive fronts of the Civil War. 
 Last spring our military situa-tion was an extremely difficult one; as you remember, wewere still to experience quite a number of defeats, of new,huge and unexpected offensives on the part of the counter-revolution and the Entente, none of which could have been anticipated by us. 
 It was therefore only natural that thegreater part of this period was devoted to the military problem, the problem of the Civil War, which seemed unsolv-able to all the faint-hearted, not to speak of the parties of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries and other petty-bourgeois democrats, and to all the intermediateelements; this induced them to declare quite sincerely thatthe problem could not be solved, that Russia was backwardand enfeebled and could not vanquish the capitalist systemof the entire world, seeing that the revolution in the West had been delayed. 
 And we therefore had to maintain our position and to declare with absolute firmness and convic-tion that we would win, we had to implement the slogans“Everything for victory!” and “Everything for the war!” To carry out these slogans it was necessary to deliberately and openly leave some of the most essential needs unsat-isfied, and time and again to deny assistance to many, in the conviction that all forces had to be concentrated on thewar, and that we had to win the war which the Entente hadforced upon us. 
 It was only because of the Party’s vigilanceand its strict discipline, because the authority of the Partyunited all government departments and institutions, because the slogans issued by the Central Committee were adopted by tens, hundreds, thousands and finally millions of peopleas one man, because incredible sacrifices were made—itwas only because of all this that the miracle which occurredwas made possible. 
 It was only because of all this that wewere able to win in spite of the campaigns of the imperial-ists of the Entente and of the whole world having been repeated twice, thrice and even four times. 
 And, of course,we not only stress this aspect of the matter; we must alsobear in mind that it teaches us that without discipline andcentralisation we would never have accomplished this task. 
The incredible sacrifices that we have made in order to save the country from counter-revolution and in order to ensure the victory of the Russian revolution over Denikin, Yude-nich and Kolchak are a guarantee of the world social revo-lution. 
 To achieve this, we had to have Party discipline,the strictest centralisation and the absolute certainty thatthe untold sacrifices of tens and hundreds of thousands of people would help us to accomplish all these tasks, and that it really could be done, could be accomplished. 
 And for thispurpose it was essential that our Party and the class which is exercising the dictatorship, the working class, should serve as elements uniting millions upon millions of working people in Russia and all over the world. 
 If we give some thought to what, after all, was the under-lying reason for this historical miracle, why a weak,exhausted and backward country was able to defeat the mostpowerful countries in the world, we shall find that it wascentralisation, discipline and unparalleled self-sacrifice. 
 On what basis? Millions of working people in a country that was anything but educated could achieve this organisation,discipline and centralisation only because the workers hadpassed through the school of capitalism and had been unitedby capitalism, because the proletariat in all the advancedcountries has united—and united the more, the more ad-vanced the country; and on the other hand, because property, capitalist property, small property under commodity pro-duction, disunites. 
 Property disunites, whereas we are unit-ing, and increasingly uniting, millions of working peopleall over the world. 
 This is now clear even to the blind, onemight say, or at least to those who will not see. 
 Our enemies grew more and more disunited as time went on. 
 They were disunited by capitalist property, by private property undercommodity production, whether they were small proprie-tors who profiteered by selling surplus grain at exorbitantprices and enriched themselves at the expense of the starvingworkers, or the capitalists of the various countries, even though they possessed military might and were creating a League of Nations, a “great united league” of all the fore-most nations of the world. 
 Unity of this kind is a sheerfiction, a sheer fraud, a sheer lie. 
 And we have seen—andthis was a great example—that this notorious League ofNations, which attempted to hand out mandates for the gov-ernment of states, to divide up the world—that this noto-rious alliance proved to be a soap-bubble which at onceburst, because it was an alliance founded on capitalistproperty. 
 We have seen this on a vast historical scale, andit confirms that fundamental truth which told us that ourcause was just, that the victory of the October Revolution was absolutely certain, and that the cause we were embark-ing on was one to which, despite all difficulties and obsta-cles, millions and millions of working people in all countries would rally. 
 We knew that we had allies, that it was only necessary for the one country to which history had presented this honourable and most difficult task to display a spirit of self-sacrifice, for these incredible sacrifices to berepaid a hundredfold—every month we held out in ourcountry would win us millions and millions of allies in allcountries of the world. 
 If, after all, we give some thought to the reason we were able to win, were bound to win, we shall find that it was only because all our enemies—who were formally tiedby all sorts of bonds to the most powerful governments andcapitalists in the world—however united they may havebeen formally, actually turned out to be disunited. 
 Theirinternal bond in fact disunited them, pitted them against each other. 
 Capitalist property disintegrated them, trans-formed them from allies into savage beasts, so that theyfailed to see that Soviet Russia was increasing the numberof her followers among the British soldiers who had beenlanded in Archangel, among the French sailors in Sevasto-pol, among the workers of all countries, of all the advanced countries without exception, where the social-compromisers took the side of capital. 
 In the final analysis this was thefundamental reason, the underlying reason, that made ourvictory certain and which is still the chief, insuperable andinexhaustible source of our strength; and it permits us toaffirm that when we in our country achieve the dictatorship of the proletariat in full measure, and the maximum unity of its forces, through its vanguard, its advanced party, wemay expect the world revolution. 
 And this in fact is an ex-pression of will, an expression of the proletarian determina-tion to fight; it is an expression of the proletarian determi-nation to achieve an alliance of millions upon millions of workers of all countries. 
 The bourgeoisie and the pseudo-socialist gentry of the Second International have declared this to be mere propa-gandist talk. 
 But it is not, it is historical reality, borneout by the bloody and painful experience of the Civil Warin Russia. 
 For this Civil War was a war against world capital; and world capital disintegrated of itself, devoured itself, amidst strife, whereas we, in a country where the prole-tariat was perishing from hunger and typhus, emerged more hardened and stronger than ever. 
 In this country we won the support of increasing numbers of working people. 
 What the compromisers formerly regarded as propagandist talk and the bourgeoisie were accustomed to sneer at, has been transformedin these years of our revolution, and particularly in theyear under review, into an absolute and indisputable histor-ical fact, which enables us to say with the most positiveconviction that our having accomplished this is evidence that we possess a world-wide basis, immeasurably wider than was the case in any previous revolution. 
 We have aninternational alliance, an alliance which has nowhere beenregistered, which has never been given formal embodiment,which from the point of view of “constitutional law” meansnothing, but which, in the disintegrating capitalist world, actually means everything. 
 Every month that we gained positions, or merely held out against an incredibly powerfulenemy, proved to the whole world that we were right andbrought us millions of new supporters. 
 This process has been a difficult one; it has been accom-panied by tremendous defeats. 
 In this very year under re-view the monstrous White terror in Finland 139 was followed by the defeat of the Hungarian revolution, which was stifledby the governments of the Entente countries that deceivedtheir parliaments and concluded a secret treaty with Rumania. 
 It was the vilest piece of treachery, this conspiracy of the international Entente to crush the Hungarian revolu-tion by means of a White terror, not to mention the fact that in order to strangle the German revolution they were readyfor any understanding with the German compromisers, 140 and that these people, who had declared Liebknecht to bean honest German, pounced on this honest German like maddogs together with the German imperialists. 
 They exceeded all conceivable bounds; but every such act of suppression on their part only strengthened and consolidated us, whileit undermined them. 
 And it seems to me that we must first and foremost draw a lesson from this fundamental experience. 
 Here we mustmake a special point of basing our agitation and propaganda on an analysis, an explanation of why we were victorious, why the sacrifices made in the Civil War have been repaid ahundredfold, and how we must act, on the basis of this experience, in order to succeed in another war, a war on a bloodless front, a war which has only changed its form, but which is being waged against us by those same representa-tives, lackeys and leaders of the old capitalist world, onlystill more vigorously, still more furiously, still more zeal-ously. 
 More than any other, our revolution has proved therule that the strength of a revolution, the vigour of its assault,its energy, determination, its victory and its triumph inten-sify the resistance of the bourgeoisie. 
 The more victorious we are the more the capitalist exploiters learn to uniteand the more determined their onslaught. 
 For, as you alldistinctly remember—it was not so long ago when judged bythe passage of time, but a long time ago when judged by themarch of events—at the beginning of the October Revolu-tion Bolshevism was regarded as a freak; this view, which was a reflection of the feeble development and weakness ofthe proletarian revolution, very soon had to be abandoned inRussia and has now been abandoned in Europe as well. 
Bolshevism has become a world-wide phenomenon, the work-ers’ revolution has raised its head. 
 The Soviet system, in creating which in October we followed the traditions of 1905, developing our own experience—this Soviet systemhas become a phenomenon of world-historic importance. 
 Two camps are now quite consciously facing each other all over the world; this may be said without the slightestexaggeration. 
 It should be noted that only this year have they become locked in a decisive and final struggle. 
 And now, at the time of this very Congress, we are passing throughwhat is perhaps one of the greatest, most acute but not yetcompleted periods of transition from war to peace. 
 You all know what happened to the leaders of the impe-rialist powers of the Entente who loudly announced to the whole world: “We shall never stop fighting those usurpers, those bandits, those arrogators of power, those enemiesof democracy, those Bolsheviks”—you know that first theylifted the blockade, that their attempt to unite the smallstates failed, because we succeeded in winning over not onlythe workers of all countries, but also the bourgeoisie of the small countries, for the imperialists oppress not only the workers of their own countries but the bourgeoisie of thesmall states as well. 
 You know that we won over the vacil-lating bourgeoisie in the advanced countries. 
 And the pres-ent position is that the Entente is breaking its former prom-ises and assurances and is violating the treaties which, incidentally, it concluded dozens of times with variousRussian whiteguards. 
 And now, as far as these treaties areconcerned, the Entente is the loser, for it squandered hun-dreds of millions on them but failed to complete the job. 
 It has now lifted the blockade and has virtually begun peace negotiations with the Soviet Republic. 
 But it is not completing these negotiations, and therefore the smallstates have lost faith in it and in its might. 
 So we see thatthe position of the Entente, its position in foreign affairs,defies all definition from the standpoint of the customaryconcepts of law. 
 The states of the Entente are neither at peace with the Bolsheviks nor at war with them; they have recognised us and they have not recognised us. 
 And thisutter confusion among our opponents, who were so convincedthat they represented something, proves that they representnothing but a pack of capitalist beasts who have fallen outamong themselves and are absolutely incapable of doing us any harm. 
 The position today is that Latvia has officially made peace proposals 141 to us. 
 Finland has sent a telegram which officially speaks of a demarcation line but actually impliesa swing to a policy of peace. 
 142 Lastly, Poland, the Poland whose representatives have been, and still are, sabre-rattling so vigorously, the Poland that has been, and still is, receiving so many trainloads of artillery and promises of help ineverything, if only she would continue the war with Russia—even Poland, the unstable position of whose governmentcompels her to consent to any military gamble, has invitedus to begin negotiations for peace. 
 143 We must be extremely cautious. 
 Our policy demands the most careful thought. 
 Here it is hardest of all to find the proper policy, for nobody asyet knows on what track the train is standing; the enemyhimself does not know what he is going to do next. 
 Thegentlemen who represent French policy and who are mostzealous in egging Poland on, and the leaders of landowner and bourgeois Poland do not know what will happen next; they do not know what they want. 
 Today they say, “Gen-tlemen, let us have a few trainloads of guns and a few hundred millions and we are prepared to fight the Bolsheviks. 
” They are hushing up the news of the strikes that are spreading in Poland; they are tightening up the censorship so as to conceal the truth. 
 But the revolutionary movement inPoland is growing. 
 The spread of revolution in Germany, inits new phase, in its new stage, now that the workers, afterthe German Kornilov-type putsch, are creating Red Armies,plainly shows (as can be seen from the recent dispatches from Germany) that the temper of the workers is rising more and more. 
 The Polish bourgeoisie and landowners are themselvesbeginning to wonder whether it is not too late, whether therewill not be a Soviet Republic in Poland before the govern-ment acts either for war or for peace. 
 They do not know whatto do. 
 They do not know what the morrow will bring. 
 But we know that our forces are growing vastly every month, and will grow even more in future. 
 The result is thatour international position is now more stable than ever. 
But we must watch the international crisis with extreme careand be prepared for any eventuality. 
 We have received aformal offer of peace from Poland. 
 These gentlemen are in desperate straits, so desperate that their friends, the German monarchists, people with better training and more politicalexperience and knowledge, plunged into a venturous gamble,a Kornilov-type putsch. 
 The Polish bourgeoisie are throw-ing out offers of peace because they know that any ventur-ous gamble may prove to be a Polish Kornilov-type affair. 
 Knowing that our enemy is in desperate straits, that our enemy does not know what he wants to do or what he willdo tomorrow, we must tell ourselves quite definitely that inspite of the peace overtures war is possible. 
 It is impossibleto foretell what their future conduct will be. 
 We have seenthese people before, we know these Kerenskys, these Men-sheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 During the past two years we have seen them one day drawn towards Kolchak,the next day almost towards the Bolsheviks, and then to-wards Denikin—and all this camouflaged by talk aboutfreedom and democracy. 
 We know these gentlemen, andtherefore we grasp at the proposal of peace with both hands and are prepared to make the maximum concessions, in the conviction that the conclusion of peace with the small stateswill further our cause infinitely more than war. 
 For the imperialists used war to deceive the working masses, they used it to conceal the truth about Soviet Russia. 
 Any peace, therefore, will open channels for our influence a hundred times wider, which, as it is, has grown considerably in thesepast few years. 
 The Third, Communist International hasachieved unparalleled successes. 
 But at the same time weknow that war may be forced upon us any day. 
 Our enemiesdo not themselves know as yet what they are capable of doing in this respect. 
 That war preparations are under way, of that there is not the slightest doubt. 
 Many of the states bordering onRussia—and perhaps many of those not bordering on Russia—are now arming. 
 That is why we must manoeuvre so flexiblyin our international policy and adhere so firmly to the course we have taken, that is why we must be prepared for anything. 
 We have waged the war for peace with extremevigour. 
 This war is yielding splendid results. 
 We have madea very good showing in this sphere of the struggle, at anyrate, not inferior to the showing made by the Red Armyon the front where blood is being shed. 
 But the conclusion of peace with us does not depend on the will of the small states even if they desire it. 
 They are up to their ears indebt to the countries of the Entente, who are wranglingand competing desperately among themselves. 
 We musttherefore remember that peace is of course possible from thepoint of view of the world situation, the historical situation created by the Civil War and by the war against the Entente. 
 But the measures we take for peace must be accompanied by intensified preparedness for defence, and in no case mustour army be disarmed. 
 Our army offers a real guarantee thatthe imperialist powers will not make the slightest attemptor encroachment on us; for although they might count on certain ephemeral successes at first, not one of them would escape defeat at the hands of Soviet Russia. 
 That we mustrealise, that must be made the basis of our agitation andpropaganda, that is what we must prepare for, in order tosolve the problem which, in view of our growing fatigue,compels us to combine the one with the other. 
 I now pass to those important considerations of prin-ciple which induced us to direct the working masses soresolutely along the lines of using the army for the solution of certain basic and immediate problems. 
 The old source of discipline, capital, has been weakened, the old source of unity has disappeared. 
 We must create a different kind of discipline, a different source of discipline and unity. 
 Coer-cion evokes the indignation, the howls, the yells and out-cries of the bourgeois democrats, who make great play of thewords “freedom” and “equality”, but do not understand thatfreedom for capital is a crime against the working people, that equality between the rich and the destitute is a crime against the working people. 
 In our fight against falsehood, weintroduced labour conscription and proceeded to unite theworking people, not hesitating to use coercion. 
 For norevolution has ever been effected without coercion, and theproletariat has a right to exercise coercion in order to hold its own at all costs. 
 When those gentry, the bourgeois, the compromisers, the German Independents, the AustrianIndependents, and the French Longuetists, argued about thehistorical factor, they always forgot such a factor as therevolutionary determination, firmness and steadfastness ofthe proletariat. 
 And that factor is precisely the steadfast-ness and firmness of the proletariat of our country, which declares, and has proved by its deeds, that we are preparedto perish to a man rather than yield our territory, ratherthan yield our principle, the principle of discipline andfirm policy, for the sake of which everything else mustbe sacrificed. 
 At the time when the capitalist countries and the capitalist class are disintegrating, at this moment of crisis and despair, this political factor is the only decisiveone. 
 Talk about minority and majority, about democracyand freedom decides nothing, however much the heroes of apast historical period may invoke them. 
 It is the class-con-sciousness and firmness of the working class that count here. 
 If the working class is prepared to make sacrifices, if it shows that it is able to strain every nerve, the problemwill be solved. 
 Everything must be directed to the solutionof this problem. 
 The determination of the working class,its inflexible adherence to the watchword “Death rather thansurrender!” is not only a historical factor, it is the decisive, the winning factor. 
 We are now going over from this victory and this convic-tion to problems of peaceful economic development, the solution of which is the chief function of our Congress. 
 In this respect we cannot, in my opinion, speak of a report of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, or, rather, of a political report of the Central Committee. 
 We must sayfrankly and bluntly that this, comrades, is a question whichyou must decide, which you must weigh with all your au-thority as the supreme Party body. 
 We have laid the questionbefore you quite clearly. 
 We have taken up a definite stand. 
 It is your duty finally to endorse, correct or amend our de-cision. 
 But in its report the Central Committee must say thaton this fundamental and urgent question it has adopted anabsolutely definite stand. 
 Yes, the thing now is to apply tothe peaceful work of economic development, to the restora-tion of our shattered industry, everything that can weld the proletariat into an absolute unity. 
 Here we need the iron discipline, the iron system, without which we could nothave held on for two months, let alone over two years. 
 Wemust be able to utilise our success. 
 On the other hand, itmust be realised that this transition will demand manysacrifices, of which the country has already made so many. 
 On the principle involved the Central Committee was quite clear. 
 Our activities were entirely governed by thispolicy and conducted in this spirit. 
 Take, for example, thequestion of corporate management versus individual manage-ment, which you will have to settle—a question which mayappear to be a subsidiary one, and which in itself, if torn from its context, cannot of course claim to be a fundamental question of principle. 
 This question should be examinedonly from the point of view of our basic knowledge, experi-ence and revolutionary practice. 
 For instance, we are toldthat “corporate management is one of the forms in which themasses participate in the work of administration”. 
 But we on the Central Committee discussed this question and took our decision, which we have to report to you—comrades, suchtheoretical confusion cannot be tolerated. 
 Had we permitteda tenth part of this theoretical confusion in the fundamentalquestion of our military activities, of our Civil War, wewould have been beaten, and would have deserved to be beaten. 
 Permit me, comrades, in connection with the report of the Central Committee and with this question of whether the new class should participate in the work of administration on a corporate or an individual basis, to introduce a little bit of theory, to point out how a class governs and what class domination actually is. 
 After all, we are not novices in thesematters, and what distinguishes our revolution from formerrevolutions is that there is nothing utopian about it. 
 Thenew class, having replaced the old class, can maintain itselfonly by a desperate struggle against other classes; and it will finally triumph only if it can bring about the abolition of classes in general. 
 That is what the vast and complexprocess of the class struggle demands; otherwise you willsink into a morass of confusion. 
 What is class domination?In what way did the bourgeoisie dominate over the feudallords? The Constitution spoke of freedom and equality. 
 That was a lie. 
 As long as there are working men, property-owners are in a position to profiteer, and indeed, as property-owners, are compelled to profiteer. 
 We declare that there isno equality, that the well-fed man is not the equal of thehungry man, that the profiteer is not the equal of the work-ing man. 
 How is class domination expressed today? The domination of the proletariat consists in the fact that the landownersand capitalists have been deprived of their property. 
 Thespirit and basic idea of all previous constitutions, even themost republican and democratic, amounted to one thing—property. 
 Our Constitution has the right, has won itself the right, to a place in history by virtue of the fact that the abolition of property is not confined to a paper declara-tion. 
 The victorious proletariat has abolished property,has completely annulled it—and therein lies its dominationas a class. 
 The prime thing is the question of property. 
 Assoon as the question of property was settled practically, the domination of the class was assured. 
 When, after that, the Constitution recorded on paper what had been actuallyeffected, namely, the abolition of capitalist and landed prop-erty, and added that under the Constitution the workingclass enjoys more rights than the peasantry, while exploit-ers have no rights whatever—that was a record of the fact that we had established the domination of our class, thereby binding to ourselves all sections and all small groups ofworking people. 
 The petty-bourgeois property-owners are disunited; those who have more property are the enemies of those who have less property; and the proletarians, by abolishing property, have declared open war on them. 
 There are still many unen-lightened and ignorant people who are wholly in favour ofany kind of freedom of trade, but who cannot fight whenthey see the discipline and self-sacrifice displayed in securingvictory over the exploiters; they are not with us, but are powerless to come out against us. 
 It is only the domination of a class that determines property relations and which classis to be on top. 
 Those who, as we so frequently observe,associate the question of the nature of class dominationwith the question of democratic centralism create suchconfusion that all successful work on this basis becomes impossible. 
 Clarity in propaganda and agitation is a funda-mental condition. 
 When our enemies said and admittedthat we had performed miracles in developing agitation andpropaganda, that was not to be understood in the superfi-cial sense that we had large numbers of agitators and used uplarge quantities of paper, but in the intrinsic sense that the truth contained in that propaganda penetrated to the minds of all; there is no escaping from that truth. 
 Whenever classes displaced each other, they changed property relations. 
 When the bourgeoisie superseded thefeudals, it changed property relations; the Constitution ofthe bourgeoisie says: “The man of property is the equal of the beggar. 
” That was bourgeois freedom. 
 This kind of “equality” ensured the domination of the capitalist class inthe state. 
 But do you think that when the bourgeoisie super-seded the feudals they confused the state with the adminis-tration? No, they were no such fools. 
 They declared that thework of administration required people who knew how to administer, and that they would adapt feudal administrators for that purpose. 
 And that is what they did. 
 Was it a mistake?No, comrades, the art of administration does not descendfrom heaven, it is not inspired by the Holy Ghost. 
 Andthe fact that a class is the leading class does not make itat once capable of administering. 
 We have an example of this: while the bourgeoisie were establishing their victory they took for the work of administration members of another class,the feudal class; there was nowhere else to get them from. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR We must be sober and face the facts. 
 The bourgeoisie had recourse to the old class; and we, too, are now confronted with the task of taking the knowledge and training of the old class, subordinating it to our needs, and using it all forthe success of our class. 
 We, therefore, say that the victo-rious class must be mature, and maturity is attested not bya document or certificate, but by experience and practice. 
 When the bourgeoisie triumphed, they did not know how to administer; and they made sure of their victory by proclaiming a new constitution and by recruiting, enlisting administratorsfrom their own class and training them, utilising for this pur-pose administrators of the old class. 
 They began to train theirown new administrators, fitting them for the work with the helpof the whole machinery of state; they sequestrated the feudal institutions and admitted only the wealthy to the schools; and in this way, in the course of many years and decades,they trained administrators from their own class. 
 Today, ina state which is constructed on the pattern and in the imageof the dominant class, we must act as every state has acted. 
If we do not want to be guilty of sheer utopianism and meaningless phrase-mongering, we must say that we must take into account the experience of the past; that we mustsafeguard the Constitution won by the revolution, but thatfor the work of administration, of organising the state, weneed people who are versed in the art of administration, whohave state and business experience, and that there is nowhere we can turn to for such people except the old class. 
 Opinions on corporate management are all too frequently imbued with a spirit of sheer ignorance, a spirit of opposi-tion to the specialists. 
 We shall never succeed with sucha spirit. 
 In order to succeed we must understand the historyof the old bourgeois world in all its profundity; and in order to build communism we must take technology and science and make them available to wider circles. 
 And we can takethem only from the bourgeoisie—there is nowhere else to getthem from. 
 Prominence must be given to this fundamentalquestion, it must be treated as one of the basic problems ofeconomic development. 
 We have to administer with the help of people belonging to the class we have overthrown; they are imbued with the prejudices of their class and we mustre-educate them. 
 At the same time we must recruit our own administrators from our own class. 
 We must use the entire machinery of state to put the schools, adult education, and all practical training at the service of the proletarians, the factory workers and the labouring peasants, under theguidance of the Communists. 
 That is the only way to get things going. 
 After our two years’ experience we cannot argue as though we were onlyjust setting about the work of socialist construction. 
 We committed follies enough in and around the Smolny period. 
 That is nothing to be ashamed of. 
 How were we to know,seeing that we were undertaking something absolutely new?We first tried one way, then another. 
 We swam with thecurrent, because it was impossible to distinguish the rightfrom the wrong; that requires time. 
 Now that is all a matter of the recent past, which we have got beyond. 
 That past, in which chaos and enthusiasm prevailed, is now over. 
 Onedocument from that past is the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. 
 It isa historic document—more, it was a period of history. 
 TheTreaty of Brest-Litovsk was forced upon us because we werehelpless in every way. 
 What sort of period was it? It was a period of impotence, from which we emerged victorious. 
 It was a period in which corporate management was univer-sal. 
 You cannot escape that historical fact by declaring thatcorporate management is a school of administration. 
 Youcannot stay for ever in the preparatory class of a school!(Applause. 
) That will not do. 
 We are grown-up now, and we shall be beaten and beaten again in every field if we behave like schoolboys. 
 We must push forward. 
 We must push higherwith energy and unanimity of will. 
 Tremendous difficultiesface the trade unions. 
 We must get them to regard this taskin the spirit of the fight against the survivals of the cele-brated democracy. 
 All these outcries against appointees, all this old and dangerous rubbish which finds its way into vari-ous resolutions and conversations must be swept away. 
Otherwise we cannot succeed. 
 If we have failed to masterthis lesson in these two years, we are lagging, and those wholag, get beaten. 
 The task is an extremely difficult one. 
 Our trade unions have been of tremendous assistance in building the proletar-ian state. 
 They were a link between the Party and the unen-lightened millions. 
 Let us not close our eyes to the fact that the trade unions bore the brunt of the struggle against all our troubles when the state needed help in food work. 
 Was this not a tremendous task? The recent issue of the Bulletin of the Central Statistical Board contains summaries by statisticians who certainly cannot be suspected of Bol-shevism. 
 Two interesting figures are given: in 1918 and 1919the workers in the consuming gubernias received seven poodsa year, while the peasants in the producing gubernias con-sumed seventeen poods a year. 
 Before the war they used to consume sixteen poods a year. 
 There you have two figuresillustrating the relation of classes in the struggle for food. 
The proletariat continued to make sacrifices. 
 People shoutabout coercion! But the proletariat justified and legitima-tised coercion; it justified it by making the greatest sacri-fices. 
 The majority of the population, the peasants of the producing gubernias of our starving and impoverishedRussia, for the first time had more food than throughout thecenturies of tsarist and capitalist Russia. 
 And we say thatthe masses will go on starving until the Red Army is victo-rious. 
 The vanguard of the working class had to make this sacrifice. 
 This struggle is a school; but when we leave this school we must go forward. 
 This step must now be taken atall costs. 
 Like all trade unions, the old trade unions have ahistory and a past. 
 In the past they were organs of resistanceto those who oppressed labour, to capitalism. 
 But now thattheir class has become the governing class, and is being called upon to make great sacrifices, to starve and to perish, the situation has changed. 
 Not everybody understands this change, not everybody grasps its significance. 
 And certain Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries who are demanding that corporate man-agement be substituted for individual management have helped us in this matter. 
 No, comrades, that won’t work. 
 We have got beyond that. 
 We are now faced with a verydifficult task; having gained victory on the bloody front,we must now gain victory on the bloodless front. 
 This waris a more difficult one. 
 This front is the most arduous. 
 Wesay this frankly to all class-conscious workers. 
 The war which we have withstood at the front must be followed by a blood-less war. 
 The fact is that the more we were victorious, themore regions we secured like Siberia, the Ukraine and the Kuban. 
 In those regions there are rich peasants; there are no proletarians, and what proletariat there is, has been corrupted by petty-bourgeois habits. 
 We know that every-body who has a piece of land in those parts says: “A fig forthe government, I’ll get all I can out of the starving. 
 A fat lotI care for the government. 
” The peasant profiteer who, whenleft to the tender mercies of Denikin, was swinging towardsus will now be aided by the Entente. 
 The war has changed its front and its forms. 
 It is now taking the form of trade, of food profiteering, which it has made international. 
 In Com-rade Kamenev’s theses published in the Bulletin of the C. 
C. 
 , R. 
C. 
P. 
 (B. 
) the underlying principles are stated fully. 
 They want to make food profiteering international. 
They want to turn peaceful economic development into the peaceful disintegration of Soviet power. 
 No you don’t, my imperialist gentlemen! We are on our guard. 
 We declare:we have fought and won, and we shall therefore retain asour basic slogan the one which helped us to victory; weshall fully preserve that slogan and apply it to the field oflabour. 
 That slogan is the firmness and unity of will of the proletariat. 
 The old prejudices, the old habits that still remain, must be discarded. 
 I should like in conclusion, to dwell on Comrade Gusev’s pamphlet, 144 which in my opinion deserves attention for two reasons. 
 It is a good pamphlet not only from the for-mal standpoint, not only because it has been written for our Congress. 
 Somehow, up to now we have all been accus-tomed to writing resolutions. 
 They say that all literature isgood except tedious literature. 
 Resolutions, I take it, shouldhe classed as tedious literature. 
 It would be better if wefollowed Comrade Gusev’s example and wrote fewer reso-lutions and more pamphlets, even though they bristled with errors as his does. 
 The pamphlet is good in spite of these errors, because it centres attention on a fundamental eco-nomic plan for the restoration of industry and productionthroughout the country, and because it subordinates every-thing to this fundamental economic plan. 
 The CentralCommittee has introduced into the theses distributed today a whole paragraph taken entirely from Comrade Gusev’s theses. 
 This fundamental economic plan can beworked out in greater detail with the help of experts. 
 We must remember that the plan is designed for many years to come. 
 We do not promise to deliver the country from hunger all at once. 
 We say that the struggle will be much harder than the one on the war front. 
 But it is a struggle thatinterests us more; it brings us nearer to our immediate andmain tasks. 
 It demands that maximum exertion of effort andthat unity of will which we have displayed before and mustdisplay now. 
 If we accomplish this, we shall gain no less a victory on the bloodless front than on the front of civil war. 
 ( Applause . 
) 3 REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE REPORT OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE MARCH 30 Comrades, the part of the political report of the Central Committee which evoked chief attack was the one ComradeSapronov called vituperation. 
 Comrade Sapronov lent a verydefinite character and flavour to the position he defended;and in order to show you how matters actually stand, Iwould like to begin by reminding you of certain basic dates. 
 Here I have before me Bulletin of the C. 
C. 
 , R. 
C. 
P. 
 (B. 
) for March 2 in which we printed a letter from the CentralCommittee to R. 
C. 
P. 
 organisations on the subject of theorganisation of the Congress. 
 And in this first letter we said:“Happily, the time for purely theoretical discussions, dis-putes over general questions and the adoption of resolutions on principles has passed. 
 That stage is over; it was dealt with and settled yesterday and the day before yesterday. 
We must march ahead, and we must realise that we are nowconfronted by a practical task , the business task of rapidly overcoming economic chaos, and we must do it with all ourstrength, with truly revolutionary energy, and with the same devotion with which our finest worker and peasant comrades, the Red Army men, defeated Kolchak, Yudenichand Denikin. 
” I must confess that I was guilty of optimism in thinking that the time of theoretical discussions had passed. 
 We hadtheorised for fifteen years before the revolution, we had been administering the state for two years, and it was about time we displayed practical, business-like efficiency; and so, onMarch 2 we appealed to comrades with practical experience. 
 In reply, Tomsky’s theses were published in Ekonomiches-kaya Zhizn on March 10, the theses of Comrades Sapronov, Osinsky and Maximovsky on March 23, and on March 27 the theses of the Moscow Gubernia Committee appeared—that is, all after our appeal to the Party. 
 And in all the thesesthe question was treated wrongly from the theoretical stand-point. 
 The view we expressed in the letter was optimistic,mistaken; it had seemed to us that this period had already passed, but the theses showed that it had not yet passed, and the comrades from the trade unions have no right to complainof having been treated unfairly. 
 The question now is, whichis right—our view, or the position advocated after our ap-peal of March 2 by all these theses? All of them contain a lotof practical material to which attention must be given. 
 If the Central Committee did not give it serious attention, it would be an absolutely worthless institution. 
 But listen to what Comrade Tomsky says. 
 “§7. 
 The basic structural principle of the regulation and management of industry, the only one that can ensure the participation of broadmasses of non-party workers through the trade unions, is the existing principle of corporate management of industry, from the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council down to the factory managements. 
 Onlyin special cases, and by mutual agreement between the Presidiums ofthe Supreme Economic Council and the All-Russia Central Trade UnionCouncil, or the Central Committees of the trade unions concerned, shouldone-man management be permitted in certain enterprises, but only on the obligatory condition that control be exercised over the adminis-trators by the trade unions and their bodies. 
 “§8. 
 To ensure a single plan of economic development and co-ordina-tion of the activities of the trade unions and the economic bodies, theparticipation of the trade unions in the management and regulation ofindustry should be based on the following principles: (a) general ques-tions of economic policy shall be discussed by the Supreme Economic Council and its organs with the participation of the trade unions;(b) the directing economic collegiums shall be formed by the SupremeEconomic Council and its organs in conjunction with the relevant tradeunion bodies; (c) the collegiums of economic bodies, while discussinggeneral questions of the economic policy of any branch of production in conjunction with the trade unions and furnishing them with period-ical reports on their activities, shall be regarded as organs of the Su-preme Economic Council only, and shall be obliged to carry out the de-cisions only of that body, (d) all collegiums of economic bodies shallunreservedly carry out the decisions of the higher organs of the SupremeEconomic Council, individually and corporately, and be accountable for their fulfilment only to the Supreme Economic Council. 
” Here the most elementary theoretical questions are ter-ribly muddled. 
 It is true that management is the job of the individual administrator; but who exactly that administrator willbe—an expert or a worker—will depend on how many admin-istrators we have of the old and the new type. 
 That is ele-mentary theory. 
 Well, then, let us talk about that. 
 But ifyou want to discuss the political line of the Central Commit-tee, do not attribute to us things we did not suggest and did not say. 
 On March 2 we appealed to the comrades to giveus practical support, and what did we get in reply? From thecomrades in the localities we got in reply things that areobviously wrong from the theoretical standpoint. 
 The theses ofComrades Osinsky, Maximovsky and Sapronov that appeared on March 23 contain nothing but theoretical blunders. 
 They say that corporate management in one form or anotheris an indispensable basis of democracy. 
 I assert that you willfind nothing like it in the fifteen years’ pre-revolutionaryhistory of the Social-Democratic movement. 
 Democraticcentralism means only that representatives from the localities get together and elect a responsible body, which is to do the administering. 
 But how? That depends on how many suit-able people, how many good administrators are available. 
Democratic centralism means that the congress supervisesthe work of the Central Committee, and can removeit and appoint another in its place. 
 But if we were to go into the theoretical errors contained in these theses, we should never be done. 
 I personally will not deal with thisany more, and will only say that the Central Committeeadopted the only line that could be adopted on this question. 
I know very well that Comrade Osinsky, and the others donot share the views of Makhno and Makhaisky, but Makhno’s followers are bound to seize upon their arguments. 
 They are connected with them. 
 Take the theses of the Moscow Guber-nia Committee of the Party that we have been given. 
 Itsays there that in a developed socialist society, where therewill be no social division of labour or fixed professions, theperiodical replacement of people performing administrative functions in rotation will be possible only on the basis of a broad corporate principle, and so on and so forth. 
 Thisis a sheer muddle! We appealed to the experienced people in the localities to help us with their practical advice. 
 Instead, we are told that the Central Committee ignores the localities. 
 What does it ignore? Dissertations on socialist society? There isnot a trace of anything practical or business-like here. 
 Ofcourse, we have some splendid workers, who are borrowinga lot from the intelligentsia; but sometimes they borrow theworst, not the best. 
 Then something has to be done about it. 
 But if in reply to an appeal of the Central Committee for practical advice you bring up questions of principle, we haveto talk about those questions. 
 We have to say that errorsof principle must be combated. 
 And the theses publishedsince March 2 contain preposterous errors of principle. 
 That is what I affirm. 
 Well, let us talk about that and argue it out. 
 Don’t try to evade it! It is no use claiming that you are not theoreticians. 
 Pardon me, Comrade Sapronov,your theses are the theses of a theoretician. 
 You would see ifthey were put into practice that you would have to turnback and settle questions in an unbusiness-like manner. 
Anybody who tried to take the theses of Comrades Maximov-sky, Sapronov and Tomsky as practical guidance, would be profoundly mistaken; they are fundamentally wrong. 
 I considerthat their idea of the attitude of the class to the structure ofthe state is fundamentally wrong and would drag us back. 
Naturally, it is backed by all the elements who are laggingbehind and have not yet got beyond all this. 
 And the au-thors of these theses are to be blamed not for deliberately advocating inefficiency, but for their theoretical mistake onthe question the Central Committee asked them to discuss,a mistake which in a way provides a banner, a justification,for the worst elements. 
 And why? From want of thought. 
Authentic documents prove this beyond all doubt. 
 I now pass to the accusation made by Comrade Yurenev in connection with Comrade Shlyapnikov. 
 If the CentralCommittee had removed Comrade Shlyapnikov, as a repre-sentative of the opposition, just before the Congress, thatcertainly would have been infamous. 
 When we had estab-lished that Comrade Shlyapnikov was leaving, we said in the Political Bureau that we were not giving him any instruc-tions before his departure; and on the eve of his departureComrade Shlyapnikov came to me and said that he was not going on the instructions of the Central Committee. 
 And so Comrade Yurenev simply heard a rumour and is now spreading it. 
 (Yurenev : “Shlyapnikov told me so himself.... 
”) I do not know how he could have told you so himself, seeing that he came to me before he left and said that hewas not going on the instructions of the Central Committee. 
Yes, of course, if the Central Committee had banished theopposition before the Congress that would have been an un-pardonable thing. 
 But, in general, when there is talk about banishing people, I say: “Well, then, just try to elect aCentral Committee which could distribute forces properlywithout giving any cause for complaint. 
” How can forces bedistributed so that everybody is satisfied? If forces are notdistributed, how can you talk about centralism? And if there were distortions of principles, let us have instances. 
 If you say that we banished representatives of the opposition,give us an instance, and we shall examine it, for there mayhave been mistakes. 
 Perhaps Comrade Yurenev, who com-plained to the Political Bureau of having been wrongfullywithdrawn from the Western Front—perhaps he was ban-ished? The Political Bureau examined the matter and found it correct. 
 And whatever Central Committee you elected,it would have to distribute its forces. 
 Further, as regards the division of business between the Organising Bureau and the Political Bureau. 
 Comrade Maxi-movsky is more experienced in matters of organisation than I am, and he says that Lenin is mixing Organising Bureau and Political Bureau questions. 
 Well, let us see. 
 In ouropinion, the Organising Bureau should distribute forces andthe Political Bureau deal with policy. 
 If such a divisionis wrong, how are the functions of these two bodies to bedivided? Do you want us to write a constitution? It is difficult to draw a hard and fast line between the Political Bureau and the Organising Bureau, to delimit their functionsprecisely. 
 Any question may become a political one, eventhe appointment of the superintendent of a building. 
 Ifanyone has any other solution to suggest, please let us haveit. 
 Comrades Sapronov, Maximovsky and Yurenev, let us have your proposals; just try to divide, to delimit the Organ-ising Bureau and the Political Bureau. 
 As we have it, theprotest of a single member of the Central Committee is enough for us to treat the question as a political one. 
 Yet in all this time there has not been a single protest. 
 Independence is not hampered in any way: any member of the Central Committee may declare a question to be a political one. 
 Andanybody who has any practical experience in organisation,even if he is not as competent as Comrade Maximovsky,even if he has worked in this field only six months, oughtto have made a different sort of criticism from the one Com-rade Maximovsky made. 
 Let the critics make definite recom-mendations. 
 We shall accept them, and advise the electionof a new Central Committee, which will carry out these rec-ommendations. 
 But all we have had is abstract criticismand false assertions. 
 Let us suppose you keep the Organising Bureau away from political leadership. 
 What, then, I ask, will political lead-ership amount to? Who does the leading, if not people? Andhow can you lead except by distributing forces? How canyou compel a man to carry out instructions if he is incom-petent? He is given certain instructions, his work is checked,and finally he is put on another job. 
 What more must we do to bring this home to Comrades Maximovsky, Sapronov and Osinsky, who in their theses propose a theoretical amend-ment that was rejected long ago? What they are doing inpractice is even worse, and they are making it quite clearthat they have no material for serious criticism. 
 I heard one practical point in Comrade Sapronov’s speech and jumped at it. 
 Comrade Sapronov said: “The Seventh Congress of Soviets gave a ruling, and we are violating it;the decree on requisitioning flax is an infringement of thedecision of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. 
”I cannot remember even a tenth of the decrees we pass. 
But I made inquiries in the Secretariat of the Council of People’s Commissars about the regulations governing flax procurements. 
 The decree was passed on February 10. 
 Andwhat has happened? There is not a comrade, whether onthe Political Bureau or on the All-Russia Central ExecutiveCommittee, who is opposed to independent initiative. 
 Wehave seen them all here on this platform. 
 Comrades know that they can speak for themselves. 
 Why did they not appeal against this decision? Let us have your complaints! Therewas no such complaint after February 10. 
 After a long fight, we adopted this decision, which was proposed by Comrade Rykov and agreed to by Comrade Sereda and the People’s Commissariat of Food. 
 “You have made a mistake!” we are told. 
 Perhaps we have. 
 Correct us. 
 Submit this question to thePolitical Bureau. 
 That will be a formal decision. 
 Let ushave the minutes. 
 If they show that we have violated adecision of the Congress, we ought to be put on trial. 
 Whereis the charge? On the one hand, they reproach us on account of Shlyapnikov; on the other, they say that the flax business was a violation of a decision. 
 Be good enough to bring factsto show that we violated the decision. 
 But you do not bringany facts. 
 All your words are mere words: initiative, ap-pointments, and so on. 
 Why then have centralism? Could wehave held out for even two months if we had made no appoint-ments during this period, during these two years when in various places we passed from complete exhaustion and dis-ruption to victory again? Just because you are displeasedwith the recall of Comrade Shlyapnikov or Comrade Yurenev,you fling these words among the crowd, among the unenlight-ened masses. 
 Comrade Lutovinov says that the question has not been settled. 
 It will have to be settled. 
 If two people’s commissars differ in their opinion of Ivan Ivanovich, andone says that a question of policy is involved, what is tobe done? What method do you propose? Do you think thatit is only in the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Execu-tive Committee that tedious questions arise? Let me tell you that there is not a single institution where tedious questions do not arise, and we all have to deal with questionsof Maria Ivanovna and Sidor Ivanovich. 
 But you cannotsay that no politics are involved here, for politics fill allminds. 
 Comrade Lutovinov had—I do not know how toput it; I fear to offend Comrade Sapronov’s delicate ear and I shrink from using a polemical expression—but he said that Comrade Krestinsky threatened to bring about a split. 
 Ameeting of the Bureau was held on the subject. 
 We have theminutes of the Bureau, and I would ask all the Congressdelegates to take these minutes and read them. 
 We came tothe conclusion that Comrade Krestinsky was hot-headed and that you, Comrade Lutovinov and Comrade Tomsky, had raised a very malodorous scandal. 
 Perhaps we were wrong—then correct our decision; but it is preposterous to say what you said, without having read the documents and without mentioning that there was a special meeting and that the matter was investigated in the presence of Tomsky and Lu-tovinov. 
 There are two other points I still have to deal with. 
 First, the appointment of Comrades Bukharin and Radek. 
 Itis said that we sent them to the All-Russia Central TradeUnion Council as political commissars, and the attempt is being made here to represent this as a violation of independ-ence, as bureaucracy. 
 Perhaps you know better theoreticiansthan Radek and Bukharin. 
 Then by all means let us havethem. 
 Perhaps you know people better acquainted withthe trade union movement. 
 Let us have them. 
 Do you meanto say that the Central Committee has no right to reinforce a trade union with people who have the best theoretical knowledge of the trade union movement, who are acquaintedwith the experience of the Germans, and who can counteractan incorrect line? A Central Committee which did not dothat could not be a directing body. 
 The more we are sur-rounded by peasants and Kuban Cossacks the more difficul-ties we have with the proletarian dictatorship. 
 Therefore the line must be straightened out at all costs and made ashard as steel, and this is the line we recommend to the PartyCongress. 
 Comrade Bubnov told us here that he has close connections with the Ukraine and thereby betrayed the true character of his objections. 
 He said that the Central Committee is responsible for the growing strength of the Borotba Party. 
 This is a very complex and important issue, and I think inthis important issue, which demanded manoeuvring, andvery complex manoeuvring at that, we emerged victorious. 
When we said in the Central Committee that the maximum concessions should be made to the Borotbists, we were laughed at and told that we were not following a straight line. 
But you can fight in a straight line when the enemy’s lineis straight. 
 But when the enemy moves in zigzags, and notin a straight line, we have to follow him and catch him atevery turn. 
 We promised the maximum concessions to the Borotbists, but on condition that they pursued a communist policy. 
 In this way we showed that we are in no way intol-erant. 
 And that these concessions were made quite rightly is shown by the fact that all the best elements among the Borotbists have now joined our Party. 
 We have carried out a re-registration of this party, and instead of a revolt of the Borotbists, which seemed inevitable, we find that, thanks tothe correct policy of the Central Committee, which wascarried out so splendidly by Comrade Rakovsky, all the bestelements among the Borotbists have joined our Party underour control and with our recognition, while all the rest have disappeared from the political scene. 
 This victory was worth a couple of good tussles. 
 So anybody who says that the Cen-tral Committee is guilty of strengthening the Borotbists doesnot understand the political line on the national question. 
 I shall just touch on the speech of the last comrade, who said that everything in the programme about the trade unions should be deleted. 
 There you have an example of hastiness. 
 We don’t do things so simply. 
 We say that nothing shouldbe deleted, that the question should be discussed in pam-phlets, articles in the press, and so on. 
 The trade unions areheading for the time when they will take economic life,namely industry, into their hands. 
 The talk about not admit-ting bourgeois specialists into the trade unions is a prejudice. 
 The trade unions are educational bodies, and strict demandsmust be made on them. 
 The Central Committee will nottolerate bad educators. 
 Education is a long and difficultbusiness. 
 A decree is not enough here; patient and skilfulhandling is required. 
 And that is what we are aiming at and will continue to aim at. 
 It is a matter in which we must be cautious but firm. 
 4 SPEECH ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MARCH 31 Comrades, first two brief remarks. 
 Comrade Sapronov continued to accuse me of forgetfulness, but the question he raised he left unexplained. 
 He continued to assure us thatthe flax requisitioning decree is a violation of the decisionof the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. 
 I maintainthat you cannot hurl unsupported accusations, very seriousaccusations, at a Party Congress in that way. 
 Of course, if the Council of People’s Commissars has violated a decision of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee it shouldbe put on trial. 
 But how is it that from February 10 to thisday no complaint has been received that this decree isa violation? All we get is an absolutely unsupported accusa-tion of the sort that are handed out easily enough, but such methods of fighting are not to be taken seriously. 
 Comrade Milyutin says that there are practically no points of difference between us, and that therefore it looksas if Lenin opposes squabbling and himself provokes thissquabble. 
 But Comrade Milyutin is distorting things some-what, which he ought not to do. 
 The first draft of the resolution, compiled by Comrade Trotsky, was then edited corporately in the Central Committee. 
 We sent this draftto Comrades Milyutin and Rykov. 
 They returned it with thestatement that they would give battle on it. 
 This is whatactually happened. 
 After we had developed agitation andobtained allies, they organised an all-round opposition at the Congress; and it was only when they saw that nothing would come of it that they began to say they were almostin agreement. 
 That is so, of course; but you must carry it through to the end and admit that your agreement means that you failed completely after the opposition came forward here and tried to consolidate itself on the issue of corporate management. 
 Only after Comrade Milyutin hadspoken for fifteen minutes, and his time was up, did itoccur to him that it would be well to put the matter on apractical footing. 
 He was quite right there. 
 But I am afraidit is too late: although Comrade Rykov has still to close the discussion, the opposition cannot be saved. 
 If the advocates of corporate management had during the past two monthspractised what they preached, if they had given us even asingle example—not by saying there is a certain directorand an assistant, but by an inquiry promoting a detailedinvestigation of the problem, comparing corporate manage-ment with individual management as was decided by the Congress of Economic Councils and by the Central Commit-tee—we would have been much the wiser; at the Congress wewould then have had something more than not very relevantdiscussions of principle, and the advocates of corporate man-agement might have furthered matters. 
 Their position would have been a strong one if they could have produced even ten factories with similar conditions managed on the corporateprinciple and compared them in a practical manner with thestate of affairs in factories with similar conditions, but man-aged on the individual principle. 
 We could have allowedany speaker an hour for such a report, and he would have furthered matters considerably. 
 We might perhaps have established practical gradations in this question of corporatemanagement. 
 But the whole point is that none of them,neither the Economic Council members nor the trade union-ists, who should have had practical data at their disposal,gave us anything, because they had nothing to give. 
 They have nothing, absolutely nothing! Comrade Rykov objected here that I want to remake the French Revolution, that I deny that the bourgeoisie grew upwithin the feudal system. 
 That is not what I said. 
 WhatI said was that when the bourgeoisie replaced the feudalsystem they took the feudal lords and learned from them how to administer; and this in no way contradicts the fact that the bourgeoisie grew up within the feudal system. 
 And asfor my thesis that, after it has seized power, the working class begins to put its principles into effect, nobody, abso-lutely nobody, has refuted it. 
 After it has seized power, the working class maintains it, preserves it and consolidates it as every other class does, namely, by a change of propertyrelations and by a new constitution. 
 That is my first andfundamental thesis; and it is incontrovertible. 
 My secondthesis that every new class learns from its predecessor andtakes over administrators from the old class, is also an abso-lute truth. 
 And, lastly, my third thesis is that the working class must increase the number of administrators from itsown ranks, establish schools, and train executives ona nation-wide scale. 
 These three theses are indisputable, andthey fundamentally contradict the theses of the trade unions. 
 At the meeting of the group, when we examined their theses, and when Comrade Bukharin and I were defeated, 145 I told Comrade Tomsky that article 7 in the theses is the result of complete theoretical confusion. 
 It says: “The basic structural principle of the regulation and management of industry, the only one that can ensure the participation of broad massesof non-party workers through the trade unions, is the existing principleof corporate management of industry, from the Presidium of the Su-preme Economic Council down to the factory managements. 
 Only in special cases, and by mutual agreement between the Presidiums of the Supreme Economic Council and the All-Russia Central Trade UnionCouncil, or the Central Committees of the trade unions concernedshould one-man management be permitted in certain enterprisesbut only on the obligatory condition that control be exercisedover the administrators by the trade unions and their bodies. 
” This is sheer nonsense, because everything—the role of the working class in winning state power, the interrelationof methods—everything is muddled! Such things cannotbe tolerated. 
 Such things drag us back theoretically. 
 The same must be said of the democratic centralism of Comrades Sapronov, Maximovsky and Osinsky. 
 Comrade Osinsky for-gets that when he comes forward and claims that I calldemocratic centralism nonsense. 
 You cannot distort thingsin that way! What has the question of appointments, ofendorsement by local organisations, got to do with it? You can have things endorsed by collegiums and you can also appoint collegiums. 
 That has nothing to do with the case. 
They say that democratic centralism consists not only in the All-Russia Central Executive Committee ruling; but in the All-Russia Central Executive Committee ruling through the local organisations. 
 What has corporate management or individual management got to do with it? Comrade Trotsky recalled his report made in 1918 and, reading the speech he then made, pointed out that at thattime not only did we argue about fundamental questions buta definite decision was taken by the All-Russia Central Exec-utive Committee. 
 I dug up my old pamphlet The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government , which I had completely forgotten, and find that the question of individual manage-ment was not only raised but even approved in the theses ofthe All-Russia Central Executive Committee. 
 We work insuch a way that we forget not only what we ourselves have written but even what has been decided by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, and subsequently dig upthese decisions. 
 Here are some passages from this pamphlet. 
 “Those who deliberately (although most of them probably do not realise it) promote petty-bourgeois laxity would liketo see in this granting of ‘unlimited’ (i. 
e. 
, dictatorial) powers to individuals a departure from the collegiate prin-ciple, from democracy and from the principles of Sovietgovernment. 
 Here and there, among Left Socialist-Revo-lutionaries, a positively hooligan agitation, i. 
e. 
, agitationappealing to the base instincts and to the small proprie-tor’s urge to ‘grab all he can’, has been developed against the dictatorship decree.... 
 146 “Large-scale machine industry—which is precisely the material source, the productive source, the foundation ofsocialism—calls for absolute and strict unity of will , which directs the joint labours of hundreds, thousands and tens ofthousands of people. 
 The technical, economic and historical necessity of this is obvious, and all those who have thought about socialism have always regarded it as one of the condi-tions of socialism” ... this is the only way in which “strictunity of will can be ensured.... 
 “But be that as it may, unquestioning subordination to a single will is absolutely necessary for the success of processes organised on the pattern of large-scale machine industry. 
 On the railways it is twice and three times asnecessary.... 
 “And our whole task, the task of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which is the class-conscious vehicle of the striv-ings of the exploited for emancipation, is to appreciate this change, to understand that it is necessary, to stand atthe head of the exhausted people who are wearily seekinga way out and lead them along the true path, along the pathof labour discipline, along the path of co-ordinating the taskof arguing at mass meetings about the conditions of work with the task of unquestioningly obeying the will of the Soviet leader, of the dictator, during the work.... 
 “It required precisely the October victory of the working people over the exploiters, it required a whole historicalperiod in which the working people themselves could firstof all discuss the new conditions of life and the new tasks, in order to make possible the durable transition to superior forms of labour discipline, to the conscious appreciation ofthe necessity for the dictatorship of the proletariat, to un-questioning obedience to the orders of individual represent-atives of the Soviet government during the work.... 
 “We must learn to combine the ‘public meeting’ democracy of the working people—turbulent, surging, overflowing its banks like a spring nood with iron discipline while at work, with unquestioning obedience to the will of a single person, the Soviet leader, while at work. 
” On April 29, 1918, the All-Russia Central Executive Com-mittee adopted a resolution fully endorsing the basic propo-sitions set forth in this report and instructed its Presidium to recast them as theses representing the principal tasks ofthe Soviet government. 
 We are thus reiterating what wasapproved two years ago in an official resolution of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee! And we are now beingdragged back on a matter that was decided long ago, a matter which the All-Russia Central Executive Committee endorsed and explained, namely, that Soviet socialist democracy andindividual management and dictatorship are in no waycontradictory, and that the will of a class may sometimes becarried out by a dictator, who sometimes does more aloneand is frequently more necessary. 
 At any rate, the attitude towards the principles of corporate management and indi-vidual management was not only explained long ago, butwas even endorsed by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. 
 In this connection our Congress is an illustration of the sad truth that instead of advancing from the expla-nation of questions of principle to concrete questions, we are advancing backward. 
 Unless we get away from this mis-take we shall never solve the economic problem. 
 I should also like to say a few words about certain re-marks of Comrade Rykov’s. 
 He asserts that the Council ofPeople’s Commissars is putting obstacles in the way of the amalgamation of the commissariats running the economy. 
 And when Comrade Rykov is told that he wants to swallow upComrade Tsyurupa, he replies, “I don’t care if it is Tsyurupathat swallows me up, as long as the economic commissariatsare amalgamated. 
” I know where this leads, and I must saythat the attempt of the Supreme Economic Council to form a sort of separate bloc of the economic commissariats, separate from the Council of Defence and the Council of People’sCommissars, did not pass unnoticed by the Central Com-mittee, and met with disfavour. 
 The Council of Defence hasnow been renamed the Council of Labour and Defence. 
 Youwant to separate yourselves from the Commissariat of the Army, which is giving its best forces to the war and is an institution without which you cannot even carry out labourconscription. 
 And we cannot carry out labour conscriptionwithout the People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs either. 
Take the post office; we cannot send a letter without the Com-missariat of Posts and Telegraphs. 
 Take the People’s Com-missariat of Health. 
 How will you conduct the economy if seventy per cent are down with typhus? What it amounts tois that every matter must be co-ordinated and referred toan economic commissariat. 
 Is not such a plan absolutely ab-surd? Comrade Rykov had no serious argument. 
 That iswhy it was opposed and the Central Committee did not support it. 
 Further, Comrade Rykov joked about a bloc with Comrade Holtzmann, which Comrade Trotsky seems to be forming. 
I should like to say a few words on this. 
 A bloc is alwaysneeded between Party groups that are in the right. 
 Thatshould always be regarded as an essential condition for a correct policy. 
 If Comrade Holtzmann, whom, I regret to say, I know very little, but of whom I have heard as a representa-tive of a certain trend among the metalworkers, a trend that particularly insists on sensible methods—which I stress in my theses, too—if it, is on these grounds that he insists on individual management, that, of course, can only be extreme-ly useful. 
 A bloc with this trend would be an exceedinglygood thing. 
 If the representation of the trade unions on theCentral Committee is to be increased, it would be useful tohave on it representatives of this trend too—though it maybe wrong on certain points, it is at least original and has a definite shade of opinion of its own—side by side with the extremist champions of corporate management who arebattling in the name of democracy but who are mistaken. 
Let them both be represented on the Central Committee—and you will have a bloc. 
 Let the Central Committee be soconstituted that, with the help of a bloc, a field of operation may be found that functions all the year round, and not only during the week a Party Congress is held. 
 We have always re-jected the principle of regional representation, because it leadsto a lot of regional cliquism. 
 When it is a question of closerfusion with the trade unions, of being alive to every shade ofopinion in the trade unions, of maintaining contacts—it is essential for the Central Committee to be constituted in such a way as to have a transmission belt to the broad massesof the trade unions (we have 600,000 Party members and3,000,000 trade union members) to connect the Central Com-mittee simultaneously with the united will of the 600,000Party members and the 3,000,000 trade union members. 
 We cannot govern without such a transmission belt. 
 The more we won back of Siberia, the Kuban area and the Ukraine, withtheir peasant population, the more difficult the problembecame, and the more laboriously the machine revolved,because in Siberia the proletariat is numerically small,and it is weaker in the Ukraine too. 
 But we know that the Donets Basin and Nikolayev workers have bluntly refused to defend the semi-demagogic corporate principle into whichComrade Sapronov has lapsed. 
 There can be no question butthat the proletarian element in the Ukraine differs fromthe proletarian element in Petrograd, Moscow and Ivanovo-Voznesensk—not because it is no good, but for purely histor-ical reasons. 
 They did not have occasion to become, so steeled by hunger, cold and strife as the proletarians of Moscow andPetrograd. 
 We therefore need such a bond with the trade unions, such a form of organisation of the Central Committee, as would enable it to know every shade of opinion, not only among the 600,000 Party members, but also among the 3,000,000 trade union members, so that it may be able atany moment to lead them all as one man! Such an organisa-tion is essential. 
 That is the basic factor, the political factorwithout which the dictatorship of the proletariat will not bea dictatorship. 
 If we are to have a bloc, let it be a real bloc! We should not be afraid of it, but should welcome it and practise it more vigorously and more extensively right inthe central institutions of the Party. 
 5 SPEECH ON THE CO-OPERATIVES147 APRIL 3 It was only last night and today that I have had an oppor-tunity of partially acquainting myself with the two resolu-tions. 
 I think that the resolution of the minority of the com-mission is the more correct. 
 Comrade Milyutin attacked itwith a great battery of terrifying words: he discovered half-measures in it, even quarter-measures; he accused it ofopportunism. 
 But it seems to me that the devil is not as black as he is painted. 
 If you get down to the root of the matter you will see that Comrade Milyutin, who tried togive the matter a basis in principle, showed by his own argu-ments that the resolution he advocated was incorrect andunsuitable specifically from the standpoint of practice andof Marxism. 
 It is incorrect for the following reasons; Mi-lyutin stated that his resolution, the resolution of the majority of the commission, advocated fusion with the volostexecutive committees, subordination to the volost executivecommittees, and that is why he sees in his resolution direct-ness and decisiveness as compared with the insufficientlyrevolutionary character of the minority resolution. 
 During the long course of our revolutionary campaign we have seen that whenever we made proper preparations for our revo-lutionary actions they were crowned with success; but thatwhen they were merely imbued with revolutionary fervourthey ended in failure. 
 What does the resolution of the minority of the commis-sion say? The resolution of the minority says: direct your attention to intensifying communist work in the consumers’societies and to securing a majority within them; first make ready the organs to which you want to hand them over, then you can hand them over. 
 Compare this with the line pursued by Milyutin. 
 He says: the co-operatives are no good, there-fore hand them over to the volost executive committees. 
 Buthave you a communist basis in the co-operatives you want tohand over? The essence of the matter—preparation—is ignored; only the ultimate slogan is given. 
 If this communistwork has been done, and organs have been set up to take them over and guide them, the transfer is quite natural, and there is no need to proclaim it at a Party congress. 
 But have younot been threatening the peasants enough? Has not the Sup-reme Economic Council shaken its fist enough at the peas-ants and the co-operatives in the matter of the flax procure-ment? If you recall the practical experience of our work in the localities and in the Council of People’s Commissars, you will admit that this is a wrong attitude to take, and thatthe right resolution is the one which declares that the workof communist education and the training of executives arenecessary, for otherwise the transfer will be impossible. 
 The second question of cardinal importance is that of contacts with the consumers’ co-operatives. 
 Here Comrade Milyutin says something utterly inconsistent. 
 If the con-sumers’ co-operatives are not fulfilling all their assign-ments—which is what we have been saying for two years ina number of decrees directed against the kulaks—it must beremembered that government measures against the kulaks can also be applied against the co-operative societies. 
 And this is being done in full. 
 The most important thing at themoment is to increase production and the quantity of goods. 
If the consumers’ co-operatives do not get this done, theywill be punished for it. 
 But if, owing to their connectionwith the producers’ co-operatives, they give even a small increase of products, we must welcome it and foster the ini-tiative. 
 If the consumers’ co-operatives, in spite of theircloser, intimate local connections with production, do notshow an increase, it will mean that they have not fulfilledthe direct assignment of the Soviet government. 
 If there areeven two or three energetic comrades in a district who are prepared to combat the kulaks and the bourgeoisie, victory is assured. 
 In what way was Comrade Chuchin’s initiativethwarted? He did not cite a single instance. 
 But the idea that we must link up the producers’ co-operatives with the consumers’ co-operatives and agree to any concession that may increase the amount of products in the near future fol-lows logically from our experience of the past two years. 
It in no way hampers either communist functionaries orSoviet officials in their war on the kulak co-operative, thebourgeois type of co-operative. 
 Far from hampering them, itprovides them with a new weapon. 
 If you succeed in organ-ising anything at all we shall give you a bonus; but if you do not fulfil this assignment we shall punish you, notonly because you are counter-revolutionary—we have theCheka for that, as was rightly pointed out here—no, we shallpunish you for not fulfilling the assignment of the state, ofthe Soviet government and the proletariat. 
 Comrade Milyutin has not produced a single sound argu-ment against amalgamating the consumers’ co-operatives—all he said was that this seemed to him to be opportunismor a half-measure. 
 This is strange coming from Comrade Mi-lyutin, who, with Comrade Rykov, was prepared to makebig strides, but discovered that he cannot even make a tenth of one stride. 
 From this aspect, connections with the consum-ers’ co-operatives will be an advantage; they will make itpossible to tackle production immediately. 
 All means areavailable to prevent interference in political matters; and asto obedience in the production and economic sphere, thatdepends entirely on the People’s Commissariat of Agricul-ture and the Supreme Economic Council. 
 These means are adequate for you to be able to control the co-operatives. 
 I now come to the third question, the question of nation-alisation, which Milyutin advocated in a way that wasstrange to hear. 
 A commission was set up. 
 Comrade Krestin-sky was in a minority on the commission and Comrade Mi-lyutin was the victor. 
 But now he says: “On the question of nationalisation I am prepared not to argue. 
” Then what wasthe commission arguing about? If your standpoint is thesame as Comrade Chuchin’s you are wrong in renouncing na-tionalisation. 
 It has been asked here why, if the capital-ists have been nationalised, the kulaks cannot be nationalised too. 
 It is not surprising that this argument evoked hilarity. 
 For however you count the well-to-do peasants, those whoexploit the labour of others, you will find there are no less than half a million, perhaps even something like a million. 
 How do you propose to nationalise them? It is fantastic. 
 We have not the means for that as yet. 
 Comrade Chuchin is quite right when he says that there are a lot of counter-revolutionaries in the co-operatives. 
But that is a horse of another colour. 
 What was said aboutthe Cheka was quite in place here. 
 If you are too short-sighted to expose individual leaders of the co-operatives, then just install one Communist to detect the counter-revo-lution; if he is a good Communist—and a good Communisthas the qualities of a good member of the Cheka—he should,when assigned to a consumers’ society, bag at least twocounter-revolutionary co-operators. 
 That is why Comrade Chuchin is wrong when he advocates immediate nationalisation. 
 It would be a good thing, but it is impossible, for we are dealing with a class which isleast susceptible to our influence and which certainly can-not be nationalised. 
 We have not even nationalised all theindustrial enterprises. 
 By the time an order of the chiefadministrations and central boards reaches the localities it becomes absolutely ineffective; it is completely lost in a sea of documents, because of lack of roads and telegraph, etc. 
It is therefore impossible to speak of the nationalisation of theco-operatives as yet. 
 Comrade Milyutin is wrong in principletoo. 
 He feels that his position is weak and thinks that hecan simply withdraw this point. 
 But in that case, Comrade Milyutin, you are undermining your own resolution, you are issuing a certificate to the effect that the resolution of theminority is right; for the spirit of your resolution—tosubordinate them to the volost executive committees (thatis exactly what is said in the first clause—“take measures”)—is a Cheka spirit, wrongly introduced into an economic issue. 
 The other resolution says that the first thing to do is to increase the number of Communists, to intensify com-munist propaganda and agitation—that a basis must becreated. 
 There is nothing grandiloquent here, no immediatepromises of a land flowing with milk and honey. 
 But ifthere are Communists in the localities, they will know what has to be done, and there will be no need for Comrade Chu-chin to explain where counter-revolutionaries should betaken to. 
 Secondly, an organ must be created. 
 Create an organ and test it in action, check whether production is increasing—that is what the resolution of the minority says. 
 First of all create a basis, and then—then we shall see. 
 What has to be done will follow from this of itself. 
 Wehave enough decrees saying that counter-revolutionariesshould be handed over to the Cheka, and if there is no Cheka,to the Revolutionary Committee. 
 We need less of thisfist-shaking. 
 We must adopt the resolution of the minority, which lays down a basic line of policy. 
 6 SPEECH CLOSING THE CONGRESS APRIL 5 Comrades, in making a brief summary of the work of our Congress we must, in my opinion, first of all dwell upon the tasks of our Party. 
 The Congress has adopted a detailedresolution on the question of organisation, and as mighthave been expected, a very important place in that resolu-tion is occupied by the question of the education, the train-ing, the organisational deployment of the members of our Party. 
 The Credentials Committee has reported that over 600,000 members of our Party are represented at this Con-gress. 
 We are all fully aware of the tremendous difficultiesthe Party has had to cope with in these strenuous times,when measures had to be taken to prevent the worst elements,the offal of the old capitalist system, from seeping into the government party, from fastening themselves on to it— t is naturally an open party, for it is the government party,and as such opens the way to power. 
 One of these measureswas the institution of Party Weeks. 
 Under such conditions,at such moments, when the Party and the movement werein exceptionally trying situations, when Denikin stood north of Orel, and Yudenich within fifty versts of Petrograd, it was only people who were sincerely devoted to the causeof the emancipation of the working people who could havejoined the Party. 
 Such conditions will not occur again, at least not in the near future, and it must be said that the huge member-ship (as compared with previous congresses) our Party has attained gives rise to a certain apprehension. 
 And there isone very real danger, which is that the rapid growth of our Party has not always been commensurate with the extent to which we have educated this mass of people for the per-formance of the tasks of the moment. 
 We must always bear in mind that this army of 600,000 must be the vanguard of theworking class, and that we should scarcely have been able tocarry out our tasks during these two years if it had not beenfor iron discipline. 
 The basic condition for the maintenanceand continuance of strict discipline is loyalty; all the old means and sources of discipline have ceased to exist, and we base our activities solely on a high degree of understandingand political consciousness. 
 This has enabled us to achievea discipline which is superior to that of any other state andwhich rests on a basis different from that of the disciplinewhich is being maintained with difficulty, if it can be main-tained at all, in capitalist society. 
 We must therefore remem-ber that our task in the coming year, after the brilliantsuccesses achieved in the war, is not so much the growthof the Party as work inside the Party, the education of themembership of our Party. 
 It is not for nothing that ourresolutions on organisation devote as much space as possible to this question. 
 We must spare no effort to make this vanguard of the proletariat, this army of 600,000 members, capable of copingwith the tasks that confront it. 
 And it is confronted bytasks of gigantic international and internal importance. 
As to the international tasks, our international position has never been as good as it is now. 
 News about the life of the workers abroad seldom reaches us, yet every time you receivea couple of letters or a few issues of European or Americanworking-class socialist newspapers you experience realpleasure, because everywhere, in all parts of the world, yousee among masses formerly entirely untouched by propaganda, or steeped in wretched opportunism, in purely parliamentary socialism, a tremendous growth of interest in the Sovietpower, in the new tasks, a growth much greater than we ima-gine; everywhere you see intense revolutionary movement,ferment, and revolution has become a current issue. 
 I had occasion yesterday to glance through an issue of the newspaper of the British Socialist Labour Party. 
 The British workers, whose leaders were intellectuals and whofor decades were distinguished by their contempt for theory, are talking in quite definite tones; and the paper shows that the British workers are now taking an interest in the question of revolution, that there is a growing interest in the fight against revisionism, opportunism, and parliamentary social-ism, the social-treachery we have got to know so well. 
 Thisstruggle is becoming an issue of the day. 
 We can say quitedefinitely that our American Comrade R. 
, who has publisheda voluminous book containing a number of articles by Trots-ky and myself, thus giving a summary of the history of the Russian revolution, was quite right when he said thatthe French Revolution was victorious on a world-wide scale,and that, if it was directly crushed, it was only because itwas surrounded on the European continent by more back-ward countries, in which a movement of emulation, sympathy and support could not immediately arise. 
 The Russian revo-lution, which, owing to the yoke of tsarism and a number ofother factors (continuity with 1905, etc. 
), started beforethe others, is surrounded by countries which are on a higherlevel of capitalist development and are approaching therevolution more slowly, but more surely, durably and firmly. 
 We find that with every year, and even with every month, the number of supporters and friends of the Soviet Republic isincreasing tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold in everycapitalist country; and it must be said that we have morefriends and allies than we imagine! The attempt of world imperialism to crush us by military force has collapsed completely. 
 The international situation has now given us a much longer and more durable respitethan the one we had at the beginning of the revolution. 
 Butwe must remember that this is nothing more than a respite. 
We must remember that the whole capitalist world is armedto the teeth and is only waiting for the moment, choosing the best strategical conditions, and studying the means of attack. 
 We must never under any circumstances forgetthat all the economic power and all the military power isstill on its side. 
 We are still weak on an international scale,but we are rapidly growing and gaining strength, wrestingone weapon after another from the hands of the enemy. 
 But the enemy is lurking in wait for the Soviet Republic at every step. 
 International capital has definite designs, acalculated plan, now that the blockade has been removed, to unite, to fuse, to weld together international food speculation, international freedom of trade, with our own internal food speculation, and on the basis of this speculation to pave the way for a new war against us, to prepare anew series of traps and pitfalls. 
 And this brings us to that fundamental task which constit-uted the chief theme, the chief object of attention of ourCongress. 
 That is the task of development. 
 In this respect the Congress has done a lot. 
 A resolution has been unanimous-ly adopted on the principal question, the question of economicdevelopment and transport. 
 And now, by means of Partyeducation, we shall be able to get this resolution carried intoeffect by the three million working-class members of the tradeunions, acting as one man. 
 We shall ensure that this resolu-tion channels all our strength, discipline and energy to the restoration of the country’s economic life—first of all tothe restoration of the railways, and then to the improvementof the food situation. 
 We have now quite a number of subjects for propaganda, and every item of news we get from abroad and every new dozen members of the Party provide us with fresh material. 
 Propaganda must be carried on systematically, without thedispersion and division of forces. 
 We must bear firmly inmind that we achieved successes and performed miracles inthe military sphere because we always concentrated on themain and fundamental thing, and solved problems in a way that capitalist society could not solve them. 
 The point is that in capitalist society everything that particularly inter-ests the citizens—their economic conditions, war and peace—is decided secretly, apart from society itself. 
 The most im-portant questions—war, peace, diplomatic questions—aredecided by a small handful of capitalists, who deceive not only the masses, but very often parliament itself. 
 No parlia-ment in the world has ever said anything of weight on thequestion of war and peace. 
 In capitalist society the majorquestions affecting the economic life of the working people—whether they are to live in starvation or in comfort—aredecided by the capitalist—who is the lord, a god! In all capitalist countries, including the democratic republics, the attention of the people is diverted at such times by the cor-rupt bourgeois press, which wears the label of freedom of speech, and which will invent and circulate anything to fool and deceive the masses. 
 In our country, on the other hand, the whole apparatus of state power, the whole attention of the class-conscious worker have been entirely and exclusivelycentred on the major and cardinal issue, on the chief task. 
We have made gigantic progress in this way in the militarysphere, and we must now apply our experience to the econom-ic sphere. 
 We are effecting the transition to socialism, and the most urgent question—bread and work—is not a privatequestion, not the private affair of an employer, but the affairof the whole of society, and any peasant who thinks at allmust definitely realise and understand that if the govern-ment raises the question of the railways in its whole press, in every article, in every newspaper issue, it is because it is the common affair of all. 
 This work to develop the countrywill lead the peasant out of the blindness and ignorancethat doomed him to slavery; it will lead him to real liberty,to a state of affairs in which the working folk will be awareof all the difficulties that confront them and will direct all the forces of public organisation, all the forces of the state apparatus, all the forces of agitation to the simplest and mostessential things, rejecting all the tinsel and trimmings, allthe playing at resolutions and the artful promises which formthe subject of the newspaper agitation of all capitalist coun-tries. 
 All our forces, all our attention must be centred on these simple economic tasks, which are clear to every peasant, to which the middle, even the well-to-do, peasant, if he is atall honest, cannot object, and which we are always absolutelyright in raising at every meeting. 
 Even the masses of theleast politically-conscious workers and peasants will confirmthat the chief thing at the moment is to restore the economy in a way that will prevent it from falling again into the hands of the exploiters and will not offer the slightest indulgenceto those who, having a surplus of grain in a starving country,use it to enrich themselves and to make the poor starve. 
You will not find a single man, however ignorant and unen-lightened, who does not have the feeling that this is unjust, to whom the idea has not occurred, vague and unclear per-haps, that the arguments of the supporters of the Soviet govern-ment fully accord with the interests of the working people. 
 It is to these simple tasks, which in the big capitalist societies are kept in the background and are regarded as the private affair of the bosses, that we must direct the attention of the whole army of 600,000 Party members, among whomwe must not tolerate a single one who does not do his duty;and for the sake of this we must get the whole mass of theworkers to join us and to display the greatest self-sacrificeand devotion. 
 It will be difficult to organise this, but since, from the point of view of the working people it is just, it has tremendous moral weight and immense power ofconviction. 
 And so, confident that, thanks to the work ofthe Congress, this task can now be accomplished as brilliant-ly as we accomplished the military task (although again atthe price of a number of defeats and mistakes), we may say that the workers of all European and American countries are now looking towards us, looking with expectancy to seewhether we shall accomplish the more difficult task confront-ing us—for it is more difficult than the achievement of mili-tary victory. 
 It cannot be accomplished by enthusiasm, byself-sacrifice and heroic fervour alone. 
 In this work of organ-isation, in which we Russians have been weaker than others, in this work of self-discipline, in this work of rejecting theincidental and striving for the main thing, nothing can bedone in a hurry. 
 And in this sphere of requisitioning grain,repairing the railways, restoring the economy, where progressis made only inch by inch, where the ground is being prepared, and where what is being done is perhaps little, but is durable—in this work, the eyes of the workers of all coun-tries are upon us, they expect new victories of us. 
 I am con-vinced that, guided by the decisions of our Congress, with the600,000 members of the Party working like one man, andestablishing closer ties with the economic bodies and the trade union bodies, we shall accomplish this task as success-fully as we accomplished the military task, and shall marchswiftly and surely towards the victory of the World Social-ist Soviet Republic! ( Applause . 
) ON COMPROMISE S148 In a talk with me, Comrade Lansbury laid particular stress on the following argument of the British opportunist leaders in the labour movement. 
 The Bolsheviks are compromising with the capital-ists, agreeing, in the Peace Treaty with Estonia, forinstance, to timber concessions; if that is the case,compromises with capitalists concluded by the moder-ate leaders of the British labour movement are equal-ly legitimate. 
 Comrade Lansbury considers this argument, very wide-spread in Britain, of importance to the workers and urgentlyrequiring examination. 
 I shall try to meet this desire. 
 I May an advocate of proletarian revolution conclude com-promises with capitalists or with the capitalist class? This, apparently, is the question underlying the above argument. 
 But to present it in this general way shows either the extreme political inexperience and low level of political consciousness of the questioner, or his chicanery in usinga sophism to veil his justification of brigandage, plunderand every other sort of capitalist violence. 
 Indeed, it would obviously be silly to give a negative reply to this general question. 
 Of course, an advocate of proletarian revolution may conclude compromises or agree-ments with capitalists. 
 It all depends on what kind of agree-ment is concluded and under what circumstances . 
 Here and here alone can and must one look for the difference between an agreement that is legitimate from the angle of the prole-tarian revolution and one that is treasonable, treacherous (from the same angle). 
 To make this clear I shall first recall the argument of the founders of Marxism and then add some very simple andobvious examples. 
 It is not for nothing that Marx and Engels are considered the founders of scientific socialism. 
 They were ruthless enemies of all phrase-mongering. 
 They taught that problemsof socialism (including problems of socialist tactics) mustbe presented scientifically. 
 In the seventies of last century,when Engels analysed the revolutionary manifesto of theFrench Blanquists, Commune fugitives, he told them in plain terms that their boastful declaration of “no compromise” was an empty phrase. 
 149 The idea of compromises must not be renounced. 
 The point is through all the compromiseswhich are sometimes necessarily imposed by force of circum-stance upon even the most revolutionary party of even themost revolutionary class, to be able to preserve, strengthen, steel and develop the revolutionary tactics and organisa-tion, the revolutionary consciousness, determination andpreparedness of the working class and its organised vanguard,the Communist Party. 
 Anybody acquainted with the fundamentals of Marx’s teachings must inevitably draw this conclusion from the totality of those teachings. 
 But since in Britain, due to a number of historical causes, Marxism has ever since Chart-ism 150 (which in many respects was something preparatory to Marxism, the “last word but one” before Marxism) beenpushed into the background by the opportunist, semi-bour-geois leaders of the trade unions and co-operatives, I shall try to explain the truth of the view expounded by means of typical examples drawn from among the universally-knownfacts of ordinary, political, and economic life. 
 I shall begin with an illustration I gave once before in one of my speeches. 
 Let us suppose the car you are travellingin is attacked by armed bandits. 
 Let us suppose that when a pistol is put to your temple you surrender your car, money and revolver to the bandits, who proceed to use this car,etc. 
, to commit other robberies. 
 Here is undoubtedly a case of compromising with highway-men, of agreement with them. 
 The agreement, though unsigned and tacitly concluded, is nevertheless quite a definite and precise one: “I give you, Mr. 
 Robber, my car, weapon andmoney; you rid me of your pleasant company. 
” The question arises: do you call the man who concluded such an agreement with highwaymen an accomplice in bandit-ry, an accomplice in a robbers’ assault upon third persons despoiled by the bandits with the aid of the car, money and weapon received by them from the person who concludedthis agreement? No, you do not. 
The matter is absolutely plain and simple, down to the smallest detail. 
 And it is likewise clear that under other circumstances the tacit surrender to the highwaymen of the car, money andweapon would be considered by every person of common senseto be complicity in banditry. 
 The conclusion is clear: it is just as silly to renounce the idea of literally all agreements or compromises with robbers as it is to acquit a person of complicity in banditry on the basis of the abstract proposition that, generally speaking,agreements with robbers are sometimes permissible andnecessary. 
 Let us now take a political illustration....

 Do everything to demonstrate, and in the most emphatic manner, our sympathy for the Moslems, their autonomy, independence, etc. 
 Give me more precise and more frequentinformation on how things stand. 
 Lenin First published in 1942 Published according to a typewritten copy SPEEC H DELIVERE D AT THE FIRS T (INAUGURA L) ALL-RUSSI A CONGRES S OF MINEWORKER S151 Comrades, allow me first of all to convey the greetings of the Council of People’s Commissars to the First Congress of Mineworkers. 
 Comrades, this Congress and this whole branch of industry are of the highest importance to the Soviet Republic. 
 You all know, of course, that without the coal industry therewould be no modern industry, no factories. 
 Coal is theveritable bread of industry; without it industry comes to a standstill; without it the railways are in a sorry state and can never be restored; without it the large-scale industryof all countries would collapse, fall to pieces and revert toprimitive barbarity; today the coal shortage and crisisare having the most dire effects even in the victor coun-tries, even in countries far more advanced than Russia and which have suffered far less in the war. 
 It is, therefore, all the more necessary to us that you, comrades, who haveassembled to form a solid, strong, powerful and class-consciousunion of mineworkers, should clearly realise the tremendoustasks with which the entire Soviet Republic, the workers’and peasants’ government confront this Congress, confront the mineworkers. 
 After two years of desperate struggle against the whiteguards and capitalists, who were sup-ported by the capitalists of the whole world, today, afterall the victories we have won, we are again faced with a sternstruggle, as severe as the previous one but a more gratefulone—the struggle on the bloodless front, on the front of labour. 
 When, on the bloody front of war, the landowners and capitalists tried to break the Soviet power in Russia, it seemed as if the cause of the Soviet Republic was hopeless, as if Soviet Russia, the weakest, most backward and most devastated of all countries, would be unable to hold its own against the capitalists of the whole world. 
 The richestpowers in the world assisted the Russian whiteguards in thisstruggle, assigned hundreds of millions of rubles to helpthem, supplied them with munitions, established specialcamps abroad for the training of officers—and to this day these recruiting bureaus still exist abroad, where, with the help of the richest capitalists in the world, Russian prisonersof war and volunteers are being recruited for the war againstSoviet Russia. 
 It naturally looked as if this was a hopelessundertaking, as if Russia could not hold out against the mili-tary powers of the world, who are stronger than we are. 
 Nevertheless, this miracle proved possible; Soviet Russia performed this miracle in two years. 
 Soviet Russia proved to be the victor in a war against all the richest powers in the world. 
 Why? Not because wewere stronger from the military standpoint, of course—thatis not the case—but because in the civilised countries there were soldiers who could no longer be deceived, although reams of paper were devoted to proving to them that the Bolshevikswere German agents, usurpers, traitors and terrorists. 
 Asa result of this, we find that soldiers returned from Odessaeither convinced Bolsheviks or declaring that they “wouldnot fight the workers’ and peasants’ government”. 
 The chief reason for our victory was that the workers of the advanced West-European countries understood and sympathised withthe working class of the world so strongly that, despite thelies of the bourgeois press, which in publications issued inmillions of copies showered disgusting calumnies on the Bol-sheviks—despite all this, the workers were on our side; and this fact determined the issue of our war. 
 Everybody realised that if hundreds of thousands of soldiers had foughtagainst us as they had fought against Germany, we wouldnot have been able to hold on. 
 This was obvious to anybodywho knows what war means. 
 Nevertheless, a miracle hap-pened: we defeated them, they were split owing to their wrangling, and their famous League of Nations turned out to resemble a league of mad dogs who are snatching eachother’s bones and cannot come to terms over a single question; however, the number of Bolshevik supporters, direct and indirect, conscious and not altogether so, is growing daily and hourly in every country. 
 Everybody who sympathises with socialism knows what happened to the Second International: for twenty-five years,from 1889 to 1914, it directed the socialist movement inall countries, but when the imperialist war broke out thesocialists of the Second International went over to the side of their governments, each defending his own. 
 All those who called themselves republicans, Socialist-Revolutionaries orMensheviks, in every country, took the side of their owngovernments, defended their own fatherland and helped toconceal the secret treaties—did not publish them. 
 The social-ists who were considered the leaders of the working class went over to the capitalists, went against the Russian working class. 
 The German Government is headed by the Scheidemanngang, who to this day call themselves Social-Democrats butwho are the foulest of butchers; in alliance with the land-owners and capitalists, they have murdered the leaders ofthe German working class, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Lieb-knecht, and slaughtered fifteen thousand German proletari-ans. 
 In the period since its foundation a year ago, the Third(Communist) International has gained a complete victory. 
The Second International has fallen to pieces. 
 So you see what a strong influence the Soviet power in Russia has had on the workers of the whole world, despite all the lies and calumnies directed against it. 
 The soldiers and workers hold that power should be vested in those whowork—he who does not work, shall not eat, but he who doeswork is entitled to a voice in the state, he can influencematters of state. 
 That is a simple truth, and millions ofworking-class people have understood it. 
 You are now faced with a difficult task, namely, to follow up our military victories by a much more difficultvictory This will be all the more difficult because here mereheroism is not enough; here results can be achieved only bypersistent work, and years of intense effort will be required. 
 All over the world the capitalists are mustering labour-power and increasing output. 
 But the workers say in reply, first feed the workers first put a stop to the wranglingfor which the workers pay with their lives, first put an end to the carnage, for millions of people perished in the recent bloodbath to decide whether the British or some other preda-tors were to rule. 
 As long as power is in the hands of the capitalists we are not thinking of increasing production butof overthrowing them. 
 But now that the capitalists have been overthrown, prove that you are able to increase productivity withoutthem; refute the lie which the capitalists spread about the class-conscious workers, when they say that this is not a revolution, not a new order, but sheer destruction, mererevenge on the capitalists; they say the workers alone cannever organise the country and lead it out of economicchaos, that they will only create anarchy. 
 That is the liewhich the capitalists of all countries are spreading in mil-lions of ways, and which non-party people, opponents of the Bolsheviks, are conveying in thousands of ways to Russianworkers too, especially to those who are under-educated,have been most corrupted by capitalism or are most ignorant. 
But if, as we have seen, we have been able, in the two yearsof Soviet power, to stand up to the whole world, it has been largely due to the heroism of the workers. 
 We are reproached for having established the dictator-ship of the proletariat, for the iron, relentless and firmrule of the workers, which stops at nothing and which saysthat whoever is not with us is against us, and that theslightest resistance to this rule will be crushed. 
 But we are proud of it and say that were it not for this iron rule of the workers, of this workers’ vanguard, we should nothave been able to hold out for two months, let alone twoyears. 
 What this dictatorship has given us is this—everytime a difficult situation arose during the war, the Partymobilised Communists, and it was they who were the first to perish in the front ranks; they perished in thousands on the Yudenich and Kolchak fronts. 
 The finest members of theworking class perished; they sacrificed themselves, realisingthat although they perished they would save future genera-tions, that they would save thousands upon thousands ofworkers and peasants. 
 They ruthlessly pilloried and hounded the self-seekers—those who during the war were concerned only for their own skins—and shot them without mercy. 
We are proud of this dictatorship, of this iron rule of the workers, which said: “We have overthrown the capitalists and we will lay down our lives to prevent any attempt of theirs to restore their rule. 
” Nobody during these two years went as hungry as the workers of Petrograd, Moscow and Iva-novo-Voznesensk. 
 It has now been computed that duringthese two years they received not more than seven poods ofbread a year, whereas the peasants of the grain-producinggubernias consumed no less than seventeen poods. 
 The work-ers have made great sacrifices, they have suffered epide-mics, and mortality among them has increased. 
 But they willprove that the workers did not rise up against the capi-talists out of vengeance, but with the inflexible determinationto create a social system in which there will be no land-owners and capitalists. 
 It was for the sake of this that these sacrifices were made. 
 It was only because of these unparal-leled sacrifices that were made consciously and voluntarilyand were backed up by the discipline of the Red Army, with-out recourse to old methods of discipline—it was only becauseof these tremendous sacrifices that the advanced workerswere able to maintain their dictatorship and earned the right to the respect of the workers of the whole world. 
 Those who are so eager to slander the Bolsheviks should not forgetthat the dictatorship entailed the greatest sacrifice andstarvation on the part of the workers who were exercising it. 
During these two years the workers of Ivanovo-Voznesensk,Petrograd and Moscow suffered more than anybody fighting on the Red fronts did. 
 This is what should be, first and foremost, borne in mind and well remembered by the comrades in the coalindustry. 
 You are a vanguard. 
 We are continuing the war—notthe bloody war, that, fortunately, is over, nobody will nowdare to attack Soviet Russia, because they know that they will be defeated since the class-conscious workers cannot be led against us; they will blow up ports, as they did in Arch-angel under the British and also in Odessa. 
 This has beenproved; this much we have gained. 
 But we are continuing thewar, we are nevertheless continuing it as an economic war. 
It is the speculators we are now fighting, the handful of workers who have been corrupted by the old capitalist system and who say to themselves, “I must have higher pay, and tohell with the rest. 
” “Give me double pay, give me two or three pounds of bread a day,” they say, heedless of the fact that they are working for the defence of the workers and peasants, for the defeat of the capitalists. 
 They must be combated by means of comradely education, by comradely persuasion,and there is nobody to do this except the trade unions. 
 Itmust be explained to such workers that if they side with thespeculators and profiteers, with the rich peasants who say,“the more grain I have the more money I shall make” and “each for himself, and God for all”, they will be following the precepts of the capitalist gentry and of all who preservethe old capitalist traditions; they must be told that weregard all who act on the old precepts as apostates and traitorswhom the working class must brand and put to shame. 
 Thereare mostly capitalist countries surrounding us and all over the world they are uniting against us, they are joining forces with our speculators; they want to overthrow us by force,and think they are stronger than we are. 
 We continue to be abesieged fortress towards which the eyes of the world’s workersare turned, for they know that their freedom will come fromhere, and in this besieged fortress we must act with military ruthlessness, with military discipline and self-sacrifice. 
 In the ranks of the workers we cannot tolerate self-seekerswho refuse to combine the interests of their group withthe interests of the workers and peasants in general. 
 We must, with the help of the trade unions, create the comradely discipline which existed in the Red Army, which is being worked out by the best of our trade unions, and which I am convinced you who have now founded the mineworkers’union will also establish. 
 Your union will be one of the foremost unions, and it will have all the state assistance we can possibly give. 
 AndI am sure that you too will make similar sacrifices to create a firm labour discipline, raise the productivity of labour and foster the spirit of self-sacrifice among the workersin the coal industry, among those who are engaged in what isprobably the hardest, dirtiest and most exhaustinglabour, and which technicians are striving to abolishaltogether. 
 But in order to save Soviet power now, industry must be fed, that is, provided with coal. 
 Unless this is done,it will be impossible to restore the economy and the railways, it will be impossible to set the factories going and provide goods to be exchanged for the peasants’ grain; the peasants cannot, of course, be content with bits of coloured paper, they are granting us a loan, because it is their duty to granta loan to the hungry workers. 
 But it is our duty to repaythis loan, and production, therefore, must be increased ten-fold and all the factories started. 
 That, comrades, is the tremendous task which faces all class-conscious workers, i. 
e. 
, those workers who realise that the issue is one of preserving and consolidating Sovietpower and socialism in order to save all future generationsfrom the yoke of the landowners and capitalists for all time. 
Those who refuse to understand this must be driven from theranks of the workers. 
 The trade unions, with their training, influence and propaganda, and their deep concern for pro-duction and discipline, will see to those who do not under-stand it sufficiently. 
 That is the way to strengthen theworkers’ and peasants’ government. 
 And by this slow butmost important work you will achieve, you must achieve,victories even more important than those gained by our Red Army at the front. 
 Published in 1920 in the Published according to pamphlet Resolutions and the pamphlet Decisions of the First (Inaugural ) All-Russia Congress of Mineworkers , Moscow SPEEC H DELIVERE D AT THE THIR D ALL-RUSSIA TRAD E UNIO N CONGRES S152 APRIL 7, 1920 (Prolonged , stormy applause . 
 Ovation . 
) Comrades, permit me to begin by conveying greetings from the Council of People’s Commissars to the Third All-Russia Congress. 
 ( Applause . 
) Comrades, Soviet power is now passing through a phaseof outstanding importance, which in many respects confrontsus with the highly complex and interesting tasks that belongto a period of change. 
 And it is the specific nature of the period that provides the trade unions with special tasks and special responsibilities in the work of building socialism. 
 That is why I should now like to dwell not so much on certain decisions of the Party Congress which has just ended(on this subject you will receive a more detailed report)as on those changes in the conditions of Soviet policy which link up all the tasks of socialist construction and the activ-ities of the trade unions. 
 The chief feature of the presentphase is the transition from war tasks, which have hithertoabsorbed all the attention and effort of the Soviet govern-ment, to tasks of peaceful economic development. 
 And itshould be mentioned right away that this is not the first time that the Soviet government and the Soviet Republic are passing through such a phase. 
 We are reverting to thisquestion once more—this is the second time since the dicta-torship of the proletariat was established that history hasbrought the work of peaceful construction into the fore-ground. 
 The first time was at the beginning of 1918, when, after the brief but very impetuous offensive of German imperi-alism, at a time when the old capitalist army had completely collapsed and when we had no army of our own and could not create one rapidly, the German imperialist predators forced the Peace of Brest-Litovsk upon us. 
 It seemed as if war tasks had receded into the background, owing to the weaknessof the available forces of the Soviet government. 
 It seemedas if we could proceed to the work of peaceful construction. 
I had occasion to make a report to the All-Russia CentralExecutive Committee at that time, too. 
 That was on April 29, 1918, nearly two years ago. 
 The Central Committee adopted a number of theses based on my report and had them published. 
I remind you of this because even at that time the thesesenumerated a number of questions—on labour discipline andso forth—which are included in the agenda of this Congress. 
There is a similarity between that time and the present. 
 I assure you that our attention is again being concentrated on the disputes and differences which were aired in thetrade union movement two years ago. 
 It would be a profoundmistake to assert that the decisions of the Ninth Congressof the Russian Communist Party arose out of the present dis-putes. 
 Such an assertion would only tend to distort the true picture of events. 
 And, therefore, in order to understand the true nature of the question and to set about its solutionin a proper way, it would be useful to compare and givesome thought to conditions as they were at the beginning of1918 and as they are today. 
 At that time, during the brief suspension of the war against German imperialism, the tasks of peace-time development assumed prominence. 
 It looked as if we might enjoy a longperiod of peaceful constructive work. 
 Civil war had notyet begun. 
 Krasnov had, with German aid, only just appearedon the Don. 
 There were no hostilities in the Urals and inthe North. 
 The Soviet Republic included a vast territory— all except what it had been deprived of by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. 
 Conditions were such that we might countupon a long period of peaceful work. 
 And, under these condi-tions, the primary question taken up by the CommunistParty and stressed in a number of resolutions (particularlythat of April 29, 1918) was the need for widespread propa-ganda of, and greater insistence on, labour discipline. 
 Dictatorial powers and one-man management are not con-tradictory to socialist democracy. 
 This must now be borne in mind, if the decisions adopted by the recent Party Con-gress and the general tasks that confront us are to be under-stood. 
 And this is not an answer to questions that have only just arisen; it has its deep roots in the very conditions ofthe period in which we live. 
 Let anyone who doubts thiscompare the situation with what it was two years ago,and he will understand that the present phase demands thatall attention be devoted to labour discipline, to the labour armies, although two years ago there was no mention of labour armies. 
 Only by comparing the issue as it stands todaywith the way it stood then, can we draw a proper conclusion,ignoring minor details and singling out what is general andfundamental. 
 The whole attention of the Communist Partyand the Soviet government is centred on peaceful economic development, on problems of the dictatorship and of one-man management. 
 Not only the experience we have had in thestubborn civil war of the past two years leads us to such asolution of these problems. 
 When we tackled them for the first time in 1918, there was no civil war and no experience to speak of. 
 It was, therefore, not only the experience of the Red Army and of the victorious Civil War, but something moreprofound, something bound up with the tasks of the dictator-ship of the working class in general, that has induced usnow, as it did two years ago, to concentrate all our atten-tion on labour discipline as the crucial factor in the eco-nomic development of socialism, and as the basis of the dicta-torship of the proletariat as we understand it. 
 Since capi-talism was overthrown, every day of our revolution has takenus further and further away from the idea about which theold internationalists, who were thoroughly petty-bourgeois,made so much ado; they believed that the decision of a majority in the democratic institutions of bourgeois parlia-mentarism—with private property in land, the means of pro-duction and capital still retained—could settle the issue,when as a matter of fact it can be decided only by a bitterclass struggle. 
 The significance of the dictatorship of the pro-letariat in actual practice unfolded before us when, after the conquest of power, we set about putting it into practice and saw that the struggle between classes had not ceased with this,that the victory over the capitalists and landowners had not destroyed these classes, that it had only smashed them, but had not completely destroyed them; suffice it to mention the international ties of capital, which are of much longer stand-ing and more solid than the ties of the working class are asyet. 
 On an international scale, capital is still stronger, both from the military and the economic standpoint, than Sovietpower and the Soviet system. 
 That is the fundamental premise from which we must proceed, and we must never forget it. 
 Forms of the struggle against capital change—atone time they acquire an open international character, atanother they are centred in one country. 
 The forms change,but the struggle goes on whether it be in the military, theeconomic, or some other sphere of the social system; and our revolution confirms the basic law of the class struggle. 
 The greater the cohesion achieved by the proletariat in over-throwing the bourgeois classes, the more it learns. 
 The revo-lution develops in the course of the struggle itself. 
 And thestruggle does not cease with the overthrow of the capitalists. 
Only after the defeat of the capitalists has been consolidated in one country does it acquire practical significance for the whole world. 
 At the beginning of the October Revolutionthe capitalists regarded our revolution as a freak—anyqueer thing may happen in those distant parts, theythought. 
 For the dictatorship of the proletariat to acquire world significance, it had to be consolidated in practice in some one country. 
 Only then did the capitalists—not only the Russiancapitalists, who at once rushed to seek the aid of othercapitalists, but the capitalists of all other countries—becomeconvinced that this matter was acquiring international sig-nificance. 
 Only then did the resistance of the capitalists on a world scale attain the force it did. 
 Only then did civil war develop in Russia and all the victorious countries do theirutmost to assist the Russian capitalists and landowners inthe Civil War. 
 The class struggle in Russia had taken full shape by 1900, whereas the socialist revolution became victorious in 1917. 
 Not only did the resistance of the overthrown class continue to develop after its overthrow, but it acquireda new source of strength in the relations between the pro-letariat and the peasantry. 
 This is known to anybody who has made any study of Marxism, who has based socialism on the international movement of the working class, as its only scientific foundation. 
 Everyone knows that Marxism givesthe theoretical reason for the abolition of classes. 
 Whatdoes this mean? For the victory of socialism it is not enoughto overthrow the capitalists; the difference between the pro-letariat and the peasantry must be abolished. 
 The position of the peasantry is this—on the one hand, it is a class of work-ing people, who for decades and centuries were oppressedby the landowners and capitalists, and it will therefore bea long time before they can forget that the workers aloneliberated them from this oppression. 
 This question couldbe discussed for decades; reams of paper have been filled on the subject, and many factional groups have taken shape around it. 
 But we now see that these differences have paledbefore reality. 
 As working people, the peasants will notforget for many years to come that it was the workersalone who liberated them from the landowners. 
 Thatcannot be contested; but they remain property-owners in a commodity-producing economy. 
 Every case of a sale of grain on the open market, of speculation and profiteeringis the restoration of a commodity-producing economy, andhence of capitalism. 
 By overthrowing the capitalists we liber-ated the peasantry, a class which in old Russia undoubtedlycomprised the majority of the population. 
 The peasants have remained property-owners in their form of production, and they are continuing to develop new capitalist relations afterthe overthrow of the bourgeoisie. 
 These are the basic featuresof our economic position. 
 Hence the absurdity of the talkwe hear from those who do not understand the state of affairs. 
The talk of equality, liberty and democracy under present conditions is nonsense. 
 We are waging a class struggle, and our aim is to abolish classes. 
 As long as workers and peasantsremain, socialism has not been achieved. 
 And, in practice,we find an irreconcilable struggle going on everywhere. 
 Wemust think about how and under what conditions theproletariat, wielding so powerful an apparatus of coercion as the state, can attract the peasant as a working man and overcome his resistance as a property-owner, or render itharmless. 
 Here the class struggle is continuing, and this throws new light on the significance of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 It appears before us not only, and not even largely, as the employment of the coercive means of the stateapparatus for the suppression of the resistance of theexploiters. 
 It is, of course, right to say that we have donea lot by taking this as the basis, but we also have anothermethod, in which the proletariat plays the part of an organ-iser, of one who has been through the school of labour and the training and discipline of the capitalist factory. 
 Wemust organise economic life on a new and more perfect basis,counting on and utilising all the achievements of capitalism. 
Without this we shall never be able to build socialism andcommunism. 
 This is much more difficult than the war tasks. 
 In many respects the war tasks are easier to accomplish. 
 They can be accomplished by enthusiasm, energy and self-sacrifice. 
 It was easier for the peasant to fight his inveterateenemy, the landowner, and more within his understanding. 
He did not have to understand the connection between thepower of the workers and the necessity to put down freedom of trade. 
 It was easier to beat the Russian whiteguards, the landowners and capitalists, and their henchmen, theMensheviks. 
 This victory will cost us more, both in timeand effort. 
 You cannot win in economic matters in the same way as in a war. 
 Freedom of trade cannot be defeated by enthusiasm and self-sacrifice. 
 Here, prolonged work is required; the ground has to be won inch by inch; the organising forces ofthe proletariat are required. 
 Victory may be achieved only ifthe proletariat wields its dictatorship as a great, organisedand organising force, a force of moral influence on all theworking people, including the non-proletarian working masses. 
 Now that we have been successful—and will continue to be equally successful—in carrying out the first and simplesttask, the suppression of the exploiters who directly at-tempt to sweep away Soviet power, a second and more com-plex task arises, which is to organise the forces of the proleta-riat, to learn to be good organisers. 
 Labour must be organ-ised in a new way; new ways of stimulating people to work and to observe labour discipline must be devised. 
 Even capi-talism took decades to accomplish this. 
 All too often the worst mistakes are made in this field. 
 Many of our opponents show a complete failure to understand this question. 
 They said we were utopians when we maintained that power could be seized. 
 On the other hand, they expect us to complete theorganisation of labour in a few months and to show resultsthat require several years to produce. 
 That is absurd. 
 Giventhe political conditions, power can be retained by the sheerenthusiasm of the workers, perhaps even in the face of the whole world. 
 That we have proved. 
 But the creation of new forms of social discipline requires decades. 
 Even capitalismrequired many decades to transform the old system of organ-isation. 
 From the theoretical standpoint it is sheer nonsenseto expect that we can reconstruct the organisation of labourin short order, and to instil this idea into the minds of the, workers and peasants. 
 And not only is it nonsense, it is extremely harmful, because it prevents the workers from clearly understandingthe difference between the new tasks and the old. 
 The newtask is to organise industry, and first of all our ownforces—and as far as organisation is concerned, we are weak, weaker than any of the advanced nations. 
 The ability to do this is developed by large-scale machine industry, and ithas never, in all history, had any other material basis thanthe productive labour of millions employing large-scalemachine industry in accordance with a previously establishedplan. 
 And here the interests of the proletariat and the peasantry do not coincide. 
 A difficult period of struggle begins—a struggle against the peasantry. 
 We must, however,make it clear to the peasants that they have no other course;they must either march with the workers, they must help theproletariat, or again succumb to the rule of the landowners. 
There is no middle course; the Mensheviks have a middle course, but it is a thoroughly rotten one and is failing everywhere, including Germany. 
 The peasant masses cannotget an understanding of this by theory or by observing theSecond and Third Internationals. 
 The peasant masses—com-prising tens of millions of people—can get an understandingof this only from their own experience, from their daily practical life. 
 The peasants could understand the victory over Kolchak and Denikin. 
 They were able to compare inpractice Kolchak and Denikin with the dictatorship of the working class which the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolu-tionaries had tried very hard and are still trying to scare the peasants with. 
 But actually the peasants could never study theory, and cannot now. 
 The peasant masses see that the Men-sheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries are all lying; and theysee the struggle we are waging against profiteering. 
 It mustbe confessed that the Mensheviks too have made some prog-ress in propaganda, having learned something from our political departments in the army. 
 The peasants saw a ban-ner on which was inscribed, not dictatorship of the prole-tariat, but Constituent Assembly, the power of the people;they did not see the word “dictatorship”, they did not evenunderstand the word. 
 But experience has taught them thatSoviet government is better. 
 And we are now faced with a second task, that of bring-ing moral influence to bear on the peasantry. 
 Coercive meth-ods towards the peasantry will help us little. 
 It is the eco-nomic differentiation of the peasantry that is involved here. 
Since the overthrow of the capitalists, the struggle has drawnthe workers close together; they have been cemented by two years of civil war. 
 The peasantry, on the other hand, is splitting up more and more. 
 The peasants cannot forgetthe landowners and capitalists; they remember them. 
 Never-theless, the peasantry of today are disunited; the interestsof one section clash with those of another. 
 The peasantryare not united. 
 For one thing, not every peasant has food sur-pluses. 
 There is no such equality. 
 It is nonsense to say there is. 
 To divide the peasantry and win over the non-kulakelements will require a lot of time. 
 It will involve a longstruggle, in which we shall employ all our forces, every meansat our disposal. 
 But force alone cannot ensure victory; moralmeans must be employed too. 
 And from this follow all the questions of dictatorial power and individual authority which to many, or to some at any rate, it may be safely said, appearto have arisen only out of our recent disputes. 
 But that isa mistake. 
 Compare the situation with that of 1918. 
 Therewere no disputes then. 
 When, after the peace with Germany, the question arose as to what should be the basis of power, we Communists re-plied—it must he made clear that democracy under the Sovietsystem does not contradict dictatorship. 
 This was not to the liking of many leaders of the old International. 
 Even Kautsky cursed me. 
 The peasants are half labourers and half property-owners, and in order to win them over to us there must be unity ofwill, all must act in unison on every practical issue. 
 Unityof will must not be a catchword, a symbol. 
 We demand it inpractice. 
 This is how unity of will was expressed during thewar—anybody who placed his own interests (or the interests of his village or group) above the common interests, was brand-ed as a self-seeker and was shot; this was justified by themoral consciousness of the working class that it must achievevictory. 
 We spoke about these shootings openly; we saidthat we made no secret of coercion, because we realised thatwe could not emerge from the old society without resorting to compulsion as far as the backward section of the prole-tariat was concerned. 
 That is the way unity of will was ex-pressed, and it was maintained in practice by punishing everydeserter; in every battle and every campaign it was main-tained by the Communists marching in the forefront and set-ting an example. 
 The present task is to try to apply this unity of will to industry and agriculture. 
 We have a terri-tory stretching thousands of versts and huge numbers offactories. 
 You must realise, therefore, that we cannot achieveour purpose by force alone; you must realise what a colos-sal task confronts us and what unity of will means today. 
It is not only a slogan. 
 It must be given thought, careful thought. 
 It is a slogan that entails prolonged, day-to-day effort. 
 Take 1918, when there were no such disputes; eventhen I pointed to the necessity for individual authority, tothe need to recognise the dictatorial authority of individualsin order to carry out the Soviet idea. 
 All talk about equalityof rights is nonsense. 
 We are not waging the class struggle on the basis of equality of rights, nor can we if the proletar-iat is to prevail. 
 Prevail it can, because we have hundredsof thousands of disciplined people expressing a single will; andit can prevail over the peasantry, which have been dispersedeconomically, and which have no common basis such aswelds together the proletariat in the factories and the cities. 
 The peasants are economically disunited. 
 They are partly property-owners and partly labourers. 
 Property drags themtowards capitalism: “The more profitably I sell, the better. 
 If they’re starving, I’ll sell at a higher price. 
” But, as a working man, the peasant knows that he suffered oppression at the hands of the landowner, from which he was liberated by the worker. 
 Here we have a conflict of two souls, result-ing from the economic status of the peasantry. 
 These twosouls must be separated one from the other. 
 And we shallwin only when we pursue a firm policy. 
 All working peoplewill always be working people to us; but as for the peasant proprietors, we have to fight them. 
 Not only are they always at each other’s throats, but they are ignorant into the bar-gain. 
 The gentlemen at the League of Nations, thank God,are not ignorant; they are probably better educated than ourMensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 But what do wefind? Japan glorifies the League of Nations, yet tries to trip up America, and so on. 
 They are all at loggerheads, whereas we are united. 
 And that is why workers in all countries are joining us. 
 Sincewe have been able to defeat such enlightened gentlemen asthe directors of international policy, who have so much expe-rience, so much wealth, and a hundred guns and battleships for every one of ours, it is absurd to think that we cannot solve the peasant problem. 
 It is discipline, loyalty, and unitedwill that will win here. 
 The will of tens and hundreds ofthousands of people can be expressed by one person. 
 Thiscomposite will is achieved in the Soviet way. 
 In no othercountry have there been so many congresses of peasants and workers as in ours. 
 That is the way we develop an enlight-ened attitude. 
 What the Soviet Constitution gives us noother state has been able to give in two hundred years. 
(Applause. 
) To take only the number of congresses—no other state has summoned so many in a century ofdemocracy. 
 In this way we arrive at common decisions and mould a common will. 
 This is the broad way in which our Soviet Constitution, our Soviet form of government are to he understood. 
 Itseffect is that the decisions of the Soviet government havepower of authority without parallel in the world, the powerof the workers and peasants. 
 But that is not enough for us. 
 We are materialists, and you cannot satisfy us with power of authority, so please take the trouble to put it into effect. 
And here we find the old bourgeois instinct gaining the upper hand, and we must frankly admit that it is stronger than we are. 
 The old petty-bourgeois habit of conducting enterprises on individual lines and trying to strengthen freedom of trade is stronger than we are. 
 The trade unions arose out of capitalism as a means of developing the new class. 
 Class is a concept which is evolvedin struggle and development. 
 There is no wall dividingone class from another. 
 The workers and peasants are not separated by a Chinese Wall. 
 How did man learn to form associations? First through the guild, and then accordingto different trades. 
 Having become a class, the proletariatgrew so strong that it took over the whole state machine,proclaimed war on the whole world and emerged victorious. 
The guilds and craft unions have now become backward insti-tutions. 
 Time was when the proletarians, under capitalism amalgamated along the lines of guild and craft. 
 This wasprogressive at that time because the proletariat could nothave amalgamated in any other way. 
 It is absurd to say thatthe proletariat could have amalgamated to form a class atonce. 
 Such amalgamation requires decades. 
 Marx, more than anybody, fought such sectarian and short-sighted views. 
 The class grows under capitalist conditions, and when the suit-able moment for revolution arrives, it takes state powerinto its own hands. 
 And then all the guilds and craft unionsbecome obsolete, they play a backward role, they are retro-grade, not because they are run by bad people, but because bad people and enemies of communism find in them fertile soil for their propaganda. 
 We are surrounded by the pettybourgeoisie who are reviving freedom of trade and capita-lism. 
 Karl Marx fought vigorously against the old utopiansocialism and advocated the scientific view, which showsthat the class struggle fosters the growth of the class, and the class must be helped to mature. 
 Marx also fought the working-class leaders who went astray. 
 In the Federal Council, in1872, a vote of censure was passed on Marx for saying thatthe British leaders had been bribed by the bourgeoisie. 
 Ofcourse, Marx did not mean this in the sense that certainpeople were traitors. 
 That is nonsense. 
 He spoke about a bloc of a certain section of the workers with the bourgeoisie. 
 The bourgeoisie supports this section of the workers directlyand indirectly. 
 That is the way in which it bribes them. 
 As far as getting its representatives elected to parlia-ment is concerned, the British bourgeoisie has worked mi-racles, and excels all others. 
 Marx and Engels exposed the bourgeoisie over a period of forty years, from 1852 to 1892,and the bourgeoisie acts in the same way in all countries. 
The fact that throughout the world trade unions havepassed from the role of slaves to the role of builders marksa turning-point. 
 We have existed for two years and what do we see? We see today that the working class has suffered most from hunger. 
 In 1918 and 1919 the country’s industrialworkers received only seven poods of bread each, whereasthe peasants of the grain-producing gubernias each hadseventeen poods. 
 Under the tsar the peasant used to get six-teen poods of bread at the best, whereas under our rule he gets seventeen poods. 
 There is statistical evidence of this. 
 The proletariat has been hungry for two years but thishunger has shown that the worker is capable of sacrificingnot only his craft interests, but even his life. 
 The prole-tariat was able to stand famine for two years because it hadthe moral support of all the labouring folk, and it bore these sacrifices for the sake of the victory of the workers’ and peasants’ government. 
 It is true that the division of workersaccording to trade continues, and that many of these tradeswere necessary to the capitalist but are not necessary to us. 
And we know that the workers in these trades are sufferingmore severely from hunger than others. 
 And it cannot be otherwise. 
 Capitalism has been smashed, but socialism has not yet been built; and it will take a long time to build. 
 Here wecome up against all sorts of misunderstandings, which are notfortuitous, but are the result of the difference in the historicalrole of the trade unions as an instrument of craft amalgama-tion under capitalism and the trade unions as an instrument of the class amalgamation of the workers after they have taken over the state power. 
 The workers are prepared to makeany sacrifice; they create the discipline which compels peopleto say and feel, perhaps vaguely, that class interests arehigher than craft interests. 
 Workers who are incapable ofmaking such sacrifices we regard as self-seekers, and we drive them out of the proletarian fold. 
 Such was the fundamental question of labour discipline, of one-man management in a general sense, as discussed by the Party Congress. 
 That is the gist of the decisions of the Party Congress, which you are all familiar with and which will be spoken of in greater detail in special reports. 
 Their meaning is that the working class has grown and matured;it has taken over the power and is fighting the whole bour-geois world; and this struggle is becoming more and moredifficult. 
 It was easier to fight in the war. 
 What is nowrequired is organisation and moral education. 
 Numerically the proletariat in Russia is at present not very strong. 
 Its ranks have grown thinner during the war and our very victo-ries have made it harder for us to govern the country. 
 Boththe trade unionists and the masses of the workers must real-ise this. 
 When we talk about dictatorship, it is not the whimof centralists. 
 The regions we have won have greatly enlarged the territory of Soviet Russia. 
 We have won Siberia, the Don and the Kuban areas. 
 There the percentage of proletarians isvery small, smaller than it is here. 
 We must go straight to theworker and tell him frankly that conditions of work havegrown more complicated. 
 We need more discipline, more indi-vidual authority and more dictatorship. 
 Without that, we cannot even dream of a bigger victory. 
 We have an organised army of three million members. 
 The 600,000 Communists,the members of the Party, must act as its vanguard. 
 But it must be realised that we have no other army with which to gain a victory than the 600,000 Communists andthe three million trade union members. 
 The acquisition of territories with a peasant-kulak population demands a new exertion of proletarian effort. 
 We are faced with a new ratioof proletarian to non-proletarian masses, of their socialand class interests. 
 Nothing can be done here by force alone,organisation and moral authority are all that is needed. 
 Henceour absolute conviction, which was expressed by our Party Congress and which I deem it my duty to uphold. 
 Our chief slogan is—let us have more one-man management, let usget closer to one-man management, let us have more labourdiscipline, let us pull ourselves together and work withmilitary determination, staunchness and loyalty, brushingaside all group and craft interests, sacrificing all private interests. 
 We cannot succeed otherwise. 
 But if we carry out this decision of the Party, carry it out to a man amongthe three million workers, and then among the tens of mil-lions of peasants, who will feel the moral authority and strength of the people who have sacrificed themselves for the victory of socialism, we shall be absolutely and complete-ly invincible.

) Bulletin of the Third Published according to All-Russia Trade Union Third All-Russia Trade Union Congress No. 
 2, Congress , Verbatim Report , April 8, 1920 1921 , verified with the text of the Bulletin THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD SOCIAL SYSTEM TO THE CREATION OF THE NEW Our newspaper153 is devoted to the problem of communist labour. 
 This is the paramount problem in the building of social-ism. 
 First of all, we must make it quite clear to ourselvesthat this question could be raised in a practical way only after the proletariat had captured political power, only after the landowners and capitalists had been expropriated, only after the proletariat, having captured state power,had achieved decisive victories over the exploiters who putup a desperate resistance and organised counter-revolution-ary rebellions and civil war. 
 It seemed that the time had arrived early in 1918—and it had indeed arrived after the February (1918) military campaign of German imperialism against Russia. 
 But onthat occasion the period was so short-lived, a new and morepowerful wave of counter-revolutionary rebellions andinvasions swept over us so quickly, that the Soviet governmenthad no opportunity, to devote itself at all closely and per-sistently to problems of peaceful development. 
 We have now passed through two years of unprecedented and incredible difficulties, two years of famine, privation,and distress, accompanied by the unprecedented victories ofthe Red Army over the hordes of international capitalistreaction. 
 Today there are serious grounds for hoping (if the French capitalists do not incite Poland to make war on us) thatwe shall get a more durable and lasting peace. 
 During these two years we have acquired some experience in organisation on the basis of socialism. 
 That is why we can, and should, get right down to the problem of communist labour, or rather, it would be more correct to say, not com-munist, but socialist labour; for we are dealing not withthe higher, but the lower, the primary stage of developmentof the new social system that is growing out of capi-talism. 
 Communist labour in the narrower and stricter sense of the term is labour performed gratis for the benefit of socie-ty, labour performed not as a definite duty, not for thepurpose of obtaining a right to certain products, not accord-ing to previously established and legally fixed quotas, butvoluntary labour, irrespective of quotas; it is labour per-formed without expectation of reward, without reward as a condition, labour performed because it has become a habitto work for the common good, and because of a consciousrealisation (that has become a habit) of the necessity ofworking for the common good—labour as the requirementof a healthy organism. 
 It must be clear to everybody that we, i. 
e. 
, our society, our social system, are still a very long way from the appli-cation of this form of labour on a broad, really mass scale. 
 But the very fact that this question has been raised, and raised both by the whole of the advanced proletariat (theCommunist Party and the trade unions) and by the state authorities, is a step in this direction. 
 To achieve big things we must start with little things. 
On the other hand, after the “big things”, after the revo-lution which overthrew capitalist ownership and placedthe proletariat in power, the organisation of economic lifeon the new basis can only start from little things. 
 Subbotniks, labour armies, labour conscription—these are the practical realisation of socialist and communistlabour in various forms. 
 This practical realisation still suffers from numerous defects. 
 Only people who are totally incapable of thinking,if we leave aside the champions of capitalism, can laugh scornfully (or rage) at them. 
 Defects, mistakes, blunders in such a new, difficult and great undertaking are inevitable. 
 Those who are afraid of the difficulties of building socialism, those who allow them-selves to be scared by them, those who give way to despair or cowardly dismay, are no socialists. 
 It will take many years, decades, to create a new labour discipline, new forms of social ties between people, and newforms and methods of drawing people into labour. 
 It is a most gratifying and noble work. 
It is our good fortune that, by overthrowing the bour-geoisie and suppressing its resistance, we have been able to win the ground on which this work has become possible . 
 And we will set about this work with all our might. 
 Per-severance, persistence, willingness, determination and abil-ity to test things a hundred times, to correct them a hundredtimes, but to achieve the goal come what may—these are qualities which the proletariat acquired in the course of the ten, fifteen or twenty years that preceded the OctoberRevolution, and which it has acquired in the two years thathave passed since this revolution, years of unprecedentedprivation, hunger, ruin and destitution. 
 These qualities ofthe proletariat are a guarantee that the proletariat will conquer.

 Lenin SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE THIRD ALL-RUSSIA CONGRESS OF TEXTILE WORKER S154 APRIL 19, 1920 (Stormy applause. 
 Ovation. 
 ) Comrades, permit me to thank you for your welcome and to convey to you the greetings of the Council of People’s Commissars. 
 The Party Congress just concluded and the resolutions it has passed are still fresh in our minds. 
 And you are allaware, too, of the important tasks which the Party Congress has set before the workers, the peasants and the working people of the Soviet Republic generally. 
 The sum andsubstance of these tasks is to create a united labour front. 
 It is fortunate for the Russian proletariat that the Civil War has been brought to a successful close; now that thereonly remains the menace of Poland, directed by the zeal of the imperialists of Western Europe, we have to make an incredibly difficult transition, we have to start building upour internal life. 
 In order to explain the tremendous change, in order to explain the difficulties that are now confronting the workingclass, I shall outline the chief stages in the development towards the communist system through which the Russian proletariat has passed. 
 Ignorant and unenlightened peasants, finding themselves for the first time in a factory, well equipped and suppliedwith wonderful modern machinery, used to be filled withamazement, overwhelmed by its unaccustomed magnificence. 
 The peasant, in his ignorance, would regard the factory-Owner as his benefactor and provider, who furnished him withwork, and without whom the working man could not subsist. 
 The helpless worker, coming from the stagnant, rustic life of the village into the seething cauldron of the factory, where he secured more bearable conditions of life, and the chance of making some kind of a living, would fall under the oppres-sive yoke of capitalist exploitation. 
 Everybody knows whatthe workers of Russia and other countries experienced duringthis painful period. 
 But then we see that the worker gradual-ly sheds his backward and crushed peasant manner and begins to rise to a higher level of development; we see him making the first attempts to combat the oppressors by means ofstrikes, the attempts of the disunited proletarian masses toorganise in trade unions; we see the worker beginning toshow signs of a new strength within him; we see that anystrike, no matter how insignificant results, always created something invaluable, something new, important and sig-nificant. 
 Strikes taught the worker to realise that there isstrength only in union with other workers, a powerful forcecapable of bringing the machines to a standstill and trans-forming the slave into a free man able to take advantage ofthe goods which belong by right to their producer. 
 We are all familiar with the picture of development of the strike movement during the past few decades, its gradual progres-. 
sion from small, disunited local strikes to wide organisedactions. 
 In 1905, a mighty strike wave swept over Russia. 
With the growth of the organised strike struggle against thecapitalists, the worker acquired a hitherto unknown strength. 
 The trade unions played a foremost part in this. 
 The workers came to realise that all the achievements of technology, allthe machines and implements of production, which the capi-talists used in their own interests and to the detriment ofthe proletariat, could and should become the property of theproletariat. 
 That was a new phase, a phase of organised resist-. 
 ance to the capitalists through the trade unions; it was a new step forward in the development of the proletariat’sconsciousness of its existence as a class. 
 The worker was nolonger a meek and helpless tool in the hands of the oppressors. 
His whole environment led him to the conviction that aconstant, tireless and unyielding struggle was essential. 
 The worker fought to secure a certain improvement in his economic condition, an increase of wages, a reduction ofhours. 
 At this stage of the trade union movement his hopes and dreams were directed to securing at least the elements of a decent life. 
 But although the proletariat’s consciousness of itself as a class even to this extent had at one time representeda tremendous step forward, there came a time when it, too,became inadequate. 
 Conditions demanded a new advance. 
 The capitalists of the world had grown more insolent and after suppressing the working masses they held them fast in the grip of a world war, engineered in order both to continue oppressing the proletariat, which was strugglingfor emancipation, and to rob each other of territory. 
 Theimperialist predators, armed to the teeth, fell upon eachother. 
 They tried to persuade the workers that the war wasbeing waged in the great cause of human emancipation. 
 But the workers did not remain blind for long. 
 The Peace of Brest-Litovsk, the Peace of Versailles, the seizure of allthe colonies by Great Britain and France opened their eyessufficiently for them to realise the true state of affairs. 
It became known that during the world war ten millionpeople had been killed and twenty million maimed, and all this only for the further enrichment of the predators. 
 Once their eyes had been opened the workers rose against the yoke of capital; the social revolution broke out, startedby the October events. 
 Our duty now is not merely to bemembers of our trade unions—that is not enough. 
 Theworkers must rise to a higher level, to develop from an op-pressed class into a ruling class. 
 We cannot count on the peas-ants as yet. 
 They are disunited and helpless, and it willbe some time before they emerge from their state of ignorance. 
The peasants can be brought out of the slough of ignoranceonly by the class which itself sprang from the peasantry,which has learned to understand the power of organisation and has been able to secure a better life—and not only under capitalism, for that was secured by the workers ofWestern Europe, but it did not save them from war. 
 Theworkers must understand that they are facing a new and farmore difficult task, namely, to take the entire administra-tion of the state into their own hands. 
 The workers must say to themselves that as long as private property remains, as long as capitalism is not smashed, no one who lives atthe expense of others should be allowed to wield power. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR That is the object of the Soviet government’s activities, a government for which the world proletariat is showing a rapidly developing sympathy. 
 When it created the new proletarian state, the working class assumed a tremendousburden. 
 The workers can destroy the exploiting classes andbring about socialism only by going hand in hand with thepeasants. 
 The peasants are still working each for himself,selling their surplus in the open market and thereby helping a handful of robbers to become still richer. 
 They do not do this wittingly; it is because they live under conditionsentirely different from those of the workers. 
 But freedomof trade means a return to capitalist slavery. 
 In order toavoid it, labour must be organised in a new way, and thereis nobody to do it but the proletariat. 
 The worker is now not only a member of his trade union organisation. 
 Such a view would imply a return to the past. 
The fight against capital is not yet over. 
 Capitalism isstill impeding the measures of the Soviet government; it isdoing so by profiteering, Sukharevka Market, 155 and so on. 
 This force can be countered only by the force of workers’ organisations built on new principles, based, not on their narrow production interests, but on the interests of the wholestate. 
 Only when the whole working class, irrespective oftrade or craft, succeeds in uniting as a ruling class andcreating a united army of labour, will it win the respect ofthe world. 
 The peasants, convinced that Kolchak and Denikin have been smashed by the strength of the proletariat, are nowfeeling the firm hand of a good manager. 
 But they will gaincomplete confidence in the proletariat only when attemptsto restore capitalism will no longer be possible. 
 Only thenwill the peasant understand that there is no place for kulaks and parasites in a proletarian country. 
 But the peasant does not as yet believe in his heart of hearts that the proletariatcan cope with its great task. 
 The unparalleled privations of the past two years, con-sciously shouldered by the proletariat of Russia fighting inthe front ranks of the Red Army, are not yet over. 
 New pri-vations and new tasks face us, which will be the more diffi-cult the greater the number of victories we win on the Redfront. 
 Extensive territories have been won in Siberia and the Ukraine, where there is no proletariat like that of Moscow, Petrograd and Ivanovo-Voznesensk, which has shown in practice that it will defend the gains of the revolution at any price. 
 Class-conscious workers must penetrate everypore of the state; they must know how to approach the peas-ants and organise them in the cause of the class which hasflung off the yoke of the landowners and is building up astate without capitalists. 
 Devotion and iron discipline are required. 
 The entire proletariat, like one man, must achieve unparalleled miracles on the labour front like those achievedon the war front. 
 Many at first thought that the revolutionwas a hopeless cause. 
 The army in a state of complete col-lapse, mass desertions from the front, lack of ammunition—that is what we inherited from Kerensky. 
 The Russian pro-letariat succeeded in rallying and knitting together scat-tered forces and in creating a united and stalwart Red Army. 
The Red Army worked miracles in repulsing the onslaughtof the capitalists, who were supported by the capitalistsof the whole world. 
 The tasks of the labour front are even moredifficult, immeasurably so. 
 But while for the Red Army only men were required, we must now throw into the labour front all the able-bodied forces of the country—men, women,and even adolescents. 
 We need iron discipline, and that isa weak point with us Russians. 
 We must display determina-tion, endurance, firmness and unanimity. 
 We must stop atnothing. 
 Everybody and everything must be used to save the rule of the workers and peasants, to save communism. 
 The war is not over, it is continuing on the bloodless front. 
 Here the enemy is still stronger than we are; thatmust be admitted. 
 The petty producers, who sell their prod-ucts in the open market, are being assisted by world capi-tal, which with one hand is prepared to re-establish trade relations, and with the other is prepared to crush the prole-tariat and Soviet Russia. 
 All the four millions of our proletariat must be prepared for new sacrifices, new privations and new hardships, nosmaller than those of the war. 
 Only thus can we hope tosmash the enemy for good. 
 The peasant, who is still temporis-ing and vacillating, will then finally become convinced of the strength of the proletariat. 
 The memory of the landown-ers, of Denikin and Kolchak is still fresh in the mind of the peasant; but he also sees laziness and idleness around him, and he says: “Yes, it may be a good thing, but not for the likes of us. 
” The peasants must be shown something else. 
 Let the work-ing class organise production as it organised the Red Army. 
Let every worker realise that he is ruling the country. 
 Thefewer we are the greater the demands made on us. 
 Russiamust be transformed into a vast army of labour heroically conscious that everything must be sacrificed for the common cause—the emancipation of the working people. 
 Everybody knows that the textile industry is at a complete standstill because today we have no cotton—it has to beimported—owing to the fact that Western Europe, too, issuffering from an acute shortage of raw materials. 
 Our one source of supply is Turkestan, which has recently been won from the whiteguards, but the transport system has not yetbeen properly organised. 
 One means of salvation at the present time is to extract and prepare peat as quickly as possible, which will enable usto start all the power stations at full capacity and save us from being completely dependent on coal regions remote from Central Russia. 
 To rely on wood fuel in the present state of disorganisa-tion is out of the question. 
 The peat deposits are situatedmainly in the textile districts. 
 And one of the chief dutiesof the textile workers must be to organise peat extraction. 
 I know that this is extremely arduous work: you have to stand up to your knees in water, and, what with the shortageof boots and living quarters, the difficulties are immense. 
 Butdid the Red Army have everything it needed? How manysacrifices, how many hardships the men of the Red Armybore when for two months they marched up to their waists in water, capturing tanks from the British ! The capitalists are hoping that the workers, exhausted and starving, willnot be able to hold out. 
 The capitalists are waiting to pounceon the workers’ state, and their one hope is that the prole-tariat will be unable to cope with the task of creating aunited labour front and will restore them to power. 
 I am very far from thinking that the work that faces us is easy, but all difficulties must and can be overcome. 
Every worker must help to organise labour, he must show the peasants that he is an organiser, and that work must be regarded as the only means of maintaining the rule of the workers and peasants. 
 When Kerensky was still in power, the capitalists, realising even then that they would be unableto retain the factories, began to do damage to production, toconclude agreements with the capitalists of other countriesfor the destruction of Russian industry so as not to surrenderit to the workers, and endeavoured to exhaust the proletariat by civil war. 
 The working class is facing a very severe test, and every working man and woman must achieve even greater miraclesthan the Red Army soldiers achieved at the front. 
 A victoryon the labour front, devotion under the drab workaday condi-tions, are immeasurably more difficult, but are a hundred times more valuable than sacrificing one’s life. 
 Away with the old isolation ! Only the worker who has proved worth his salt as a member of the Red Army of labouris worthy of being a trade union member. 
 Even though wecommit hundreds of mistakes, even though we suffer thou-sands of defeats, that will not daunt us. 
 We must realise that only the persistent onslaught of the proletariat can secure victory. 
 For two years now the proletariat has been defending the rule of the workers and peasants. 
 All over the world thesocial revolution is maturing. 
 If we want to prove that wecan cope with the task confronting us, we must, however dif-ficult the situation may be, maintain all our energy and assurance, all our proletarian enthusiasm, and achieve onthe peaceful front of labour miracles as great as those ofthe Red Army on the bloody front of struggle against theimperialists and their henchmen.

P . 
(B. 
) IN HONOUR OF LENIN’S FIFTIETH BIRTHDA Y156 APRIL 23, 1920 (Stormy applause . 
) Comrades, I must naturally begin by thanking you for two things: firstly, for the congratula-tions addressed to me today, and, secondly, even more forhaving spared me congratulatory speeches. 
 ( Applause . 
) I think that perhaps in this way we may gradually, not allat once, of course, devise a more suitable method of celebrat-ing anniversaries than the one hitherto in vogue, whichhas sometimes formed the subject of remarkably good car-toons. 
 Here is one such cartoon drawn by a prominentartist in celebration of such a jubilee. 
 I received it today with an extremely cordial letter. 
 And as the comrades have been kind enough to spare me congratulatory speeches, I willhand this cartoon round for all to see, so as to save us infuture from such jubilee celebrations altogether. 
 157 Next, I would like to say a few words about the present status of the Bolshevik Party. 
 What brought these thoughts to my mind was some lines written by a certain writer eight-een years ago, in 1902. 
 This writer is Karl Kautsky, withwhom we have now had to part ways very definitely, and whomwe have to fight, but who in the struggle against Germanopportunism used to be one of the leaders of the proletarianparty, and with whom we at one time collaborated. 
 There were no Bolsheviks then, but all the future Bolsheviks who collaborated with him appraised him very highly. 
 Here iswhat this writer wrote in 1902: “At the present time [in contrast to 1848] it would seem that not only have the Slavs entered the ranks of the revolu-tionary nations, but that the centre of revolutionary thought and revolutionary action is shifting more and more to theSlavs. 
 The revolutionary centre is shifting from the Westto the East. 
 In the first half of the nineteenth centuryit was located in France, at times in England. 
 In 1848 Ger-many too joined the ranks of the revolutionary nations.... 
 The new century opens with events which induce us to think that we are approaching a further shift of the revolutionarycentre, namely, to Russia .... 
 Russia, who has borrowed so much revolutionary initiative from the West, is now perhapsherself ready to serve as a source of revolutionary energyfor the West. 
 The Russian revolutionary movement that is now flaring up will perhaps prove to be a most potent means of exorcising that spirit of flabby philistinism and temper-ate politics which is beginning to spread in our midst,and it may cause the thirst for battle and the passionatedevotion to our great ideals to flare up in bright flamesagain. 
 Russia has long ceased to be merely a bulwark of reaction and absolutism in Western Europe. 
 It might be said that today the very opposite is the case. 
 Western Europe isbecoming a bulwark of reaction and absolutism in Russia.... 
The Russian revolutionaries might perhaps have settled withthe tsar long ago had they not been compelled at the sametime to fight his ally, European capital. 
 Let us hope that this time they will succeed in settling with both enemies, and that the new ‘Holy Alliance’ will collapse more quicklythan its predecessors. 
 But no matter how the present strugglein Russia ends, the blood and happiness of the martyrs,whom, unfortunately, she is producing in too great numbers,will not have been sacrificed in vain. 
 They will nourish the shoots of social revolution throughout the civilised world and cause them to grow more luxuriantly and rapidly. 
 In1848 the Slavs were a black frost which blighted the flowersof the peoples’ spring. 
 Perhaps they are now destined to bethe storm that will break the ice of reaction and will irre-sistibly bring a new and happy spring for the nations. 
” (K. 
 Kautsky, “The Slavs and Revolution”, Iskra No. 
 18, March 10, 1902. 
) That is what a prominent socialist, with whom we have now had to break so drastically, wrote about the revolution-ary movement in Russia eighteen years ago. 
 These words lead me to think that our Party may now find itself in a verydangerous position—the position of a man with a swelledhead. 
 It is a very stupid, shameful and ridiculous position. 
We know that the failure and decline of political partieshave very often been preceded by a state of affairs in which a swelled head is possible. 
 And, indeed, what was expected of the Russian revolution by the man I have quoted and whois now our bitterest enemy, was immense beyond measure. 
But after all, the brilliant successes and brilliant victorieswe have gained so far were gained at a time when it was stillimpossible to grapple with our main difficulties. 
 It was a time when we were confronted by war tasks, the tasks of waging a most profound and most energetic struggle againstthe landowner and tsarist reactionaries, and against reaction-ary generals. 
 And so, the tasks that are the substance of thesocialist revolution had to be postponed in order to grapplewith the task of organising the struggle against the com-mon, everyday manifestations of petty-bourgeois instincts, division and disunity, that is, against everything that woulddrag us back to capitalism. 
 These tasks were postponed bothin the economic and political spheres; we were unable totackle them properly. 
 And therefore the danger suggestedto us by the words I have quoted should be seriously borne in mind by all Bolsheviks, both severally and as an integral political party. 
 We must realise that the decisions of ourlast Party Congress must be carried out at all costs, and thismeans that a tremendous job faces us, and that a far greaterexertion of effort will be demanded than hitherto. 
 Let me conclude with the hope that under no circum-stances will we allow our Party to contract swelled head.

 87, April 24, 1920 Published in full in October Published according to 1920 in the pamphlet Fiftieth the pamphlet Birthday of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov -Lenin (1870-April 23-1920 ) N O T E S 1 2The non-party conference of the workers and Red Army men of Basmanny, Lefortovo, Alexeyevskoye and Sokolniki districts of Moscow was held September 3-4, 1919, about 3,000 people attend-ing. 
 The resolution adopted on Lenin’s report said that the workers and peasants were in danger of being hurled back into most severe slavery under the yoke of landowners and capitalists and that only ruthless struggle against the enemies could thwart the danger (Pravda No. 
 195, September 4, 1919). 
 The conference resolved to continue building up the Red Army, to strain every effort in develop-ing all branches of the national economy, maintain revolutionary discipline, and carry out all the directives of the Soviet government faithfully and without fail. 
 p. 
 19 The Kerensky period —a period from May to October 1917 when the bourgeois Provisional Government headed by Kerensky, a Social-ist-Revolutionary, was in power. 
 The Kornilov revolt was a counter-revolutionary conspiracy organised by the Russian bourgeoisie in August 1917 and headed by the tsarist general Kornilov. 
 The conspirators, relying on higher army officers, hoped, with the aid of the officer cadets and Cossack units, to seize revolutionary Petrograd, smash the Bolshevik Party, disband the Soviets and establish a military dictatorship in the country. 
 Answering the call of the Bolshevik Central Committee the Petrograd workers and revolutionary soldiers and sailors sup-pressed the Kornilov revolt. 
 Under pressure from the masses the Provisional Government was forced to order Kornilov’s arrest and to indict him and his accomplices for mutiny. 
 The attempt by the bourgeoisie and the landowners to crush the revolution failed. 
 After the defeat of the Kornilov revolt, the prestige of the Bolshevik Party among the masses grew rapidly; the Bolshevisation of the Soviets throughout the country began. 
 The Bolsheviks again issued the slogan “All Power to the Soviets!” Kaledin —tsarist general and Cossack ataman who organised a counter-revolutionary revolt in the Don area at the end of 1917. 
 Kolchak —Admiral of the tsarist navy and a hireling of British, American and French imperialism; organised a counter-revolutionary uprising against Soviet Power. 
 In November 1918 he proclaimed himself “Supreme Ruler of Russia”, seized Siberia and established a military dictatorship. 
 In 1919 the Kolchak army was routed by the Red Army, and Soviet rule was restored throughout the territory occupied by Kolchak. 
 Denikin —tsarist general, headed the counter-revolutionary in-surrection in the South of Russia and in the Ukraine. 
 In the summer and autumn of 1919, aided by Britain, France and the U. 
S. 
A. 
, Denikin ventured an offensive against the Soviet Republic from theSouth, heading for Moscow. 
 By the beginning of 1920 Denikin’sarmy had been defeated by the Red Army. 
 p. 
 20 Smolny —the building of the former Smolny Institute in Petro-grad; in October 1917 the Bolshevik Central Committee and the Revolutionary Military Committee of the Petrograd Soviet werehoused in it. 
 After the revolution it was the seat of the SovietGovernment until it moved to Moscow in March 1918. 
 p. 
 21 Lenin refers to the peace treaty between the Soviet Republic and the powers of the Quadruple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey), concluded on March 3, 1918 in Brest-Litovskand ratified by the Extraordinary Fourth All-Russia Congress ofSoviets on March 15. 
 The peace terms were extremely harsh forSoviet Russia. 
 Under the treaty, Poland, nearly all the Baltic areaand part of Byelorussia were annexed to Germany and Austria-Hungary, and the Ukraine became a separate state dependent on Germany. 
 Moreover, Soviet Russia had to pay considerable indem-nities under a rapacious supplementary treaty and finance agree-ment imposed on her by Germany in August 1918. 
 Despite its harsh terms, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk gave the Soviet state a breathing-space, enabled it to demobilise the old, disintegrating army and create a new, Red Army, start socialist construction and build up the forces for the coming battles againstinternal counter-revolution and foreign intervention. 
 Trotsky and the anti-Party group of “Left Communists” stubborn-ly resisted the conclusion of the treaty and it was only thanks toLenin’s tremendous efforts that it was signed. 
 After the November revolution in Germany in 1918 the Brest Treaty was annulled. 
 p. 
 22 Entente —the imperialist bloc of Britain, France and tsarist Russia which took final shape in 1907, and was opposed to theTriple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy. 
 The emergence of the Triple Entente was preceded by the conclusion of the Franco-Russian alliance of 1891-93 and the Anglo-French agree-ment of 1904. 
 The formation of the Entente was concluded by thesigning of the Anglo-Russian agreement in 1907. 
 During the FirstWorld War the military and political alliance of Britain, Franceand Russia was joined by the United States, Japan, Italy and other countries. 
 This alliance of imperialist powers, that later took part in the intervention against Soviet Russia, was known at the timeas “the Entente”; this the meaning given to the word by Lenin. 
 p. 
 223 4 5 6 7 8Lenin refers to the Treaty of Versailles which put an end to the First World War of 1914-18. 
 It was signed in June 1919 betweenBritain, France, Italy, Japan on the one side and the defeatedGermany, on the other. 
 The Versailles Treaty legalised the redivision of the world in favour of the victor countries. 
 Germany had to pay huge reparationsand indemnities in the form of a great number of ships, tens of mil-lions of tons of coal, half of the country’s stock of dyes and otherchemicals, and so on. 
 The Versailles Treaty was a heavy burden for the German people. 
 They had to pay high taxes and suffered chronic unemployment. 
 As far as the German imperialists and heavy industry magnates wereconcerned, they retained their dominant position in the countryand continued to extract colossal profits. 
 p. 
 22 The Siberian Government was formed on June 30, 1918 in Omsk with the aid of the British, French and American interventionists. 
 So-cialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and Cadets participated in thegovernment. 
 Under the guise of hypocritical phrases about democ-racy it pursued a counter-revolutionary policy. 
 It returned facto-ries, commercial enterprises and landed estates to their formerowners, repealed the eight-hour working day, introduced courts martial, passed a decision on the dissolution and prohibition of the Soviets, repealed the Soviet Government’s decrees and enforcedthe laws of the tsarist and the bourgeois provisional governments. 
The rout of the counter-revolutionary and interventionist armies bythe Red Army in 1919 put an end to the Siberian Government. 
 p. 
 22 This refers to the counter-revolutionary revolt of the Czechoslovak Army Corps organised by the Entente imperialists with the activeparticipation of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 The Czechoslovak Corps was formed in Russia prior to the Great October Socialist Revolution from Czech and Slovak prison-ers of war. 
 After the establishment of Soviet power in Russia the president of the Czechoslovak National Council, Tomá ] Masaryk, proclaimed the Corps part of the French army, and representativesof the Entente raised the question of its evacuation to France. 
 TheSoviet Government agreed to send it to France through Vladivostokon the condition that it surrendered its arms. 
 But the counter-revolutionary commanders of the Corps violated the agreement with the Soviet Government and at the end of May 1918 began an insur-rection against Soviet power. 
 The governments of the U. 
S. 
A. 
,Britain and France supported the insurrection. 
 French officers tookpart in it openly. 
 Acting in close contact with the whiteguardsand kulaks, the Czechoslovak Corps seized a large part of theUrals, the Volga area and Siberia, everywhere restoring bourgeois rule. 
 Whiteguard governments were formed in the occupied dis-tricts, Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries participating—the so-called Siberian Government in Omsk, the Committee ofMembers of the Constituent Assembly in Samara and others. 
 9 10 11 12Soon after the outbreak of the insurrection, on June 11, the Cen-tral Executive Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist groups in Russia issued an appeal to the soldiers of the Corps in which it ex-posed the counter-revolutionary nature of the insurrection and called upon Czech and Slovak workers and peasants to suppress the revolt and to enrol in the Czechoslovak units of the Red Army. 
 About 12,000 Czech and Slovak soldiers fought in the ranks of the Red Army. 
 In autumn 1918 the Red Army liberated the Volga area. 
 The Czechoslovak revolt was finally suppressed in 1919 when the Kol-chak revolt was crushed.

 22 Le Titre censuré!!! (Title Forbidden!!!)—a weekly newspaper published in Paris by Georges Anquetil from April 19 to June 21, 1919. 
 Altogether ten issues were published. 
 Beginning with issue No. 
 8 it co-operated with Le Titre enchaîné (Fettered Title) and offered some of its pages to the latter. 
 Le Titre censuré published mainly Anquetil’s articles or reprints from other newspapers. 
 p. 
 25 This refers to the appeal “To the Workers of Estonia from the Petrograd Soviet” published in connection with the arrival in Petrograd of the Workers banished from Estonia, and to the radio message to the Estonian Government of September 3, 1919. 
 p. 
 25 Lenin apparently refers to Churchill’s speech, a report on which was published in the Swedish newspaper Folkets Dagblad Politiken No. 
 195, August 25, 1919. 
 It stated that Winston Churchill, the Secretary of State for War, had spoken about the preparations for an offensive against Soviet Russia by the armies of fourteen states. 
 In his opinion, the offensive might begin at the end of August or in the beginning of September and end by the New Year. 
 He hoped that Latvia, Estonia and Finland, would participate in the campaign (America was to deliver the supplies). 
 The ROSTA telegraph agency text of Churchill’s speech which differs slightly from the newspaper report has the following list of fourteen states made by Lenin: Britain, the U. 
S. 
A. 
, France, Italy, Japan, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and in parentheses “Kol-chakia and Denikia” ( Lenin Miscellany XXIV , p. 
 197). 
 p. 
 26 Vorwärts (Forward)—a daily newspaper, Central Organ of the German Social-Democratic Party. 
 In accordance with a decision of the Halle Congress of the party, it was published in Berlin from 1891 under the name of Vorwärts Berliner Volksblatt as a continuation of the newspaper Berliner Volksblatt issued since 1884. 
 Engels used the columns of this paper to combat all manifestations of opportun-ism. 
 In the late nineties, after the death of Engels, Vorwärts was controlled by the Right wing of the party and regularly published articles by opportunists. 
 During the First World War Vorwärts 13 14 15 16 17took a social-chauvinist stand; after the Great October Socialist Revolution the paper carried on anti-Soviet propaganda. 
 It was published in Berlin till 1933. 
 Lenin refers to Friedrich Stampfer’s article “Kautsky gegen Spar-takus” published in Vorwärts No. 
 457 of September 7, 1919. 
 p. 
 27 Scheidemann —one of the leaders of the extreme Right, opportunist wing of German Social-Democracy. 
 In February-June 1919 he was the head of the coalition government of the Weimar republic. 
 He was one of those who organised the suppression of the German workers’ movement which was drowned in blood between 1918 and 1921.

 34 In 1919 two Communist Parties were founded in the U. 
S. 
A. 
— their core was the Left wing of the Socialist Party—the Communist Labour Party headed by John Reed and the Communist Party of the United States headed by Charles Ruthenberg. 
 The two parties had no programme disagreements. 
 Both parties passed decisions at their inaugural congresses on affiliation to the Third International. 
 In May 1921 they united to form one Communist Party. 
 At the end of the Second World War the Communist Party of the United States suffered a severe crisis as a result of the anti-party activity of Earl Browder who advocated the theory of “American exceptionalism” and of establishment of “class peace” in the U. 
S. 
A. 
 In 1944 he succeed-ed in carrying through a decision on the substitution of the non-party Communist Political Association for the Communist Party. 
 Thanks to the efforts of the Marxist core of the party the Com-munist Party of the United States was restored in July 1945. 
 From the first days of its existence the Communist Party suffered perse-cution which was intensified after the Second World War. 
 p. 
 35 The Committee for the Re-establishment of International Contacts was formed in January 1916 by French internationalists. 
 This was the first attempt to set up in France an internationalist revolutionary organisation of socialists to counterbalance the social-chauvinist organisations. 
 Lenin regarded the Committee as a 18 19 20factor in rallying the internationalist forces; he proposed that Inessa Armand participate in the Committee. 
 Under the influence of the October Revolution in Russia and the growth of the French labour movement, the Committee became the centre of the revolutionary internationalist forces in France, and in 1920 merged with the Communist Party of France. 
 The Syndicalist Defence Committee was formed in autumn of 1916 by a group of syndicalists who broke away from the Committee for the Re-establishment of International Contacts because they rejected parliamentary activity. 
 In May 1919 it resolved to join the Communist International.

P. 
 conducted its agitation in the spirit of Marxism, it was not opportunist and was really independent of the Liberals” (see present edition, Vol. 
 19, p. 
 273). 
 The small membership of the party and its poor contacts with the masses made for a certain sec-tarianism. 
 During the First World War there was a sharp struggle between the internationalists (William Gallacher, Albert Inkpin, John Maclean, Theodore Rothstein and others) and the social-chauvinist trend headed by Hyndman. 
 Some of the internationalists fol-lowed an inconsistent policy and adopted a Centrist position on cer-tain questions. 
 In February 1916, a group of B. 
S. 
P. 
 members founded a newspa-per, The Call , which played an important part in mustering the internationalists. 
 In April 1916, the party’s annual conference, held at Salford, condemned the social-chauvinist position of Hyndman and his supporters, and they left the party. 
 The British Socialist Party welcomed the October Revolution, and its members were active in the British workers’ movement in defence of Soviet Russia against the interventionists. 
 In 1919 most of the party’s local organisations (98 against 4) voted for affiliation to the Communist International. 
 The B. 
S. 
P. 
, together with the Communist Unity Group, formed the core of the Communist Party of Great Britain. 
 At the First (Unity) Congress in 1920 almost all local B. 
S. 
P. 
 organisations entered the Communist Party. 
 p. 
 35 The Shop Stewards Committees and Workers ’ Committees —elected working-class organisations which were set up at many factories in Britain during the First World War. 
 In conditions of the rise of the workers’ movement and the mounting dissatisfaction with the re-formist policy of the trade union leaders, the shop stewards, united in district and town committees and in the National Committee, led strikes for the improvement of the workers’ living conditions 21 22and carried out propaganda against the imperialist war. 
 The centre of the shop stewards’ movement was the Clydeside where the Clyde-side Workers’ Committee was set up, a body whose influence was felt by all the workers of that district. 
 The programme of the Clyde-side Committee called for the organisation of the workers on a class principle and the continuation of the struggle until the wage-labour system was completely abolished. 
 Similar committees sprang up in other towns. 
 In the period of foreign armed intervention against the Soviet Republic, the Shop Stewards Committees came out actively in support of Soviet Russia. 
 A number of leaders of the shop ste-wards’ movement (William Gallacher, Harry Pollitt, Arthur McManus and others) became founder members of the C. 
P. 
G. 
B. 
 Lenin described the shop stewards’ movement as a mass and profoundly proletarian movement. 
 p. 
 35 The Social-Democratic Party of Switzerland (known as the Socialist Party) was founded in the 1870s and affiliated to the First Interna-tional; a new party was founded in 1888. 
 The party was strongly influenced by opportunists, who took a social-chauvinist position during the First World War. 
 In the autumn of 1916 the Right wing broke away from the Party and founded its own organisation. 
 The party majority, led by Robert Grimm, followed a Centrist social-pacifist policy. 
 The Left wing adhered to the international-ist stand. 
 After the October Revolution in Russia the Left wing be-came much more influential. 
 In December 1920 the Left withdrew from the party and in 1921 merged with the Communist Party of Switzerland. 
 p. 
 35 The Socialist Party of Italy was founded in 1892 and from the very start was the scene of a sharp struggle on all basic political and tac-tical issues between the opportunist and revolutionary trends. 
 At its Congress in Reggio-Emilia (1912), the more outspoken reform-ists, who supported the war and co-operation with the government and the bourgeoisie (Ivanoe Bonomi, Leonida Bissolati and others), were expelled from the party under pressure from the Left. 
 Prior to Italy’s entry into the First World War, the party opposed war and advocated neutrality. 
 In December 1914 it expelled a group of renegades (among them Mussolini) for supporting the imperialist policy of the bourgeoisie and urging Italy’s entry into the war. 
 In May 1915, when Italy did enter the war on the side of the Entente, the party split into three distinct factions: (1) the Right wing, which helped the bourgeoisie prosecute the war, (2) the Centrists, who made up the majority of the party and pursued the policy of “non-participation in the war and no sabotage of the war”, and (3) the Left wing, which took a more resolute stand against the war, but failed to organise a consistent struggle against it. 
 The Lefts did not realise the necessity to convert the imperialist war into a civil war, or to break resolutely with the reformists. 
 The Italian social-ists held a joint conference with the Swiss socialists in Lugano (1914), took part in the international socialist conferences at Zim-23 24 25merwald (1915) and Kienthal (1916), where they sided with the Centrist majority. 
 After the October Socialist Revolution in Russia the Left wing of the Italian Socialist Party became more influential. 
 The 16th party congress, held October 5-8, 1919 in Bologna, passed a decision to join the Third International. 
 The I. 
S. 
P. 
 delegates took part inthe Second Congress of the Communist International. 
 After theCongress, Serrati, head of the delegation and a Centrist, declaredagainst the break with the reformists. 
 In January 1921, at the 17thparty congress in Livorno the Centrists who were in the majority refused to break with the reformists and to recognise all the terms of admittance to the Communist International. 
 On January 21 theLeft-wing delegates left the congress and founded the CommunistParty of Italy.

 35 Spartacists —members of a revolutionary organisation of German Left Social-Democrats formed at the beginning of the First World War by Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, ClaraZetkin, Julian Marchlewski, Léon Jogiches (Jan Tyszka) andWilhelm Pieck. 
 They carried on revolutionary propaganda amongthe people, organised mass anti-war manifestations, led strikes,and exposed the imperialist character of the world war and the treachery of the opportunist leaders of Social-Democracy. 
 The Spartacists, however, made grave blunders in certain importantquestions of theory and practical policy. 
 Lenin criticised the errorsof the German Left Social-Democrats many a time, thus helpingthem to take the correct position (see present edition, Vol. 
 22, pp. 
305-19 and Vol. 
 23, pp. 
 77-87. 
 In April 1917, the Spartacists joined the Centrist Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany in which they retained theirorganisational independence. 
 In November 1918, in the course ofthe revolution in Germany, however, they formed the SpartacusLeague, published their own programme on December 14, 1918and broke with the Independents. 
 At its inaugural congress, held from December 30, 1918 to January 1, 1919, the Spartacists founded the Communist Party of Germany.

 36 This article was written in connection with the beginning of the mobilisation of the Petrograd Communists for the front. 
 During theforeign military intervention and the Civil War there were a num-ber of such mobilisations. 
 Lenin wrote, “We concentrated our best Party forces in the Red Army; we mobilised the best of our workers; we looked for new forces at the deepest roots of our dictatorship ” (see present edition, Vol. 
 33, “How We Should Reorganise the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection”).

 The Communist Party appeal met with a warm response amongthe working people. 
 The Petrograd Committee of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) decided to mobilise 1,200 Communists for the Southern Front. 
 That same day the first group of mobilised Petrograd Communistsleft for the front, the second group on the following day and the thirdon October 2. 
 Mobilisation continued during the following days. 
 OnOctober 2, Lenin sent a telegram of greetings to the Petrograd work-ers in which he praised them for energetic measures in rendering assistance to the Southern Front. 
 Between September and November the Petrograd Party organisation dispatched for the front over 4,000Communists, of whom 1,800 were assigned to leading posts in thearmy.

 p. 
 50 Lenin refers to peace talks with William Bullitt who came to Soviet Russia in March 1919 to discuss the possible terms of peace treaties between Soviet Russia and the Allies, and the whiteguard govern-ments then existing on the territory of Russia. 
 Bullitt submittedthe proposals put forward by President Woodrow Wilson and PrimeMinister Lloyd George. 
 Guided by the desire to conclude peace as soon as possible, the Soviet Government agreed to negotiate, and introduced a number of amendments and addenda to the proposals put forward by the U. 
S. 
A. 
 and Britain, after which a final joint draft was prepared. 
 Soon after Bullitt’s departure from Soviet Russia Kolchak’s army launched an offensive, and the imperialist governments refusedto accept the Soviet proposals in the hope that Soviet Russia wouldbe defeated. 
 Wilson prohibited the publication of the draft agree-ment brought by Bullitt, and Lloyd George announced in Parlia-ment that he had not authorised anyone to negotiate with theSoviet Government.

 50 Die Rote Fahne (The Red Flag)—a newspaper founded by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg as the Central Organ of the Spartacus League, later it became the Central Organ of the Communist Party of Germany. 
 The newspaper was published inBerlin from November 9, 1918; it was repeatedly subjected topersecution and banned by the German authorities. 
 29 30Die Rote Fahne played an important part in the struggle to make the Communist Party of Germany a mass proletarian revolutionary party and to purge it of opportunist elements. 
 The newspaper carried on extensive propaganda against the militarisation of the country and for unity of action of the working class in the struggle against fascism. 
 Ernst Thälmann, Chairman of the C.

 When Hitler came to power in 1933 the newspaper was banned, but continued publication illegally and resolutely protested against the fascist regime.

 53 The Basle Manifesto was adopted at an international socialist con-gress (the Emergency Congress of the Second International), convened in November 1912 in Basle to voice the protest against the Bal-kan war and the preparations for a world imperialist war. 
 The resolution (Manifesto) called upon the socialists of all countries to “prevent the outbreak of war”. 
 “The workers consider it a crime to shoot each other down in the interest and for the profit of capital-ism, for the sake of dynastic honour and of diplomatic secret trea-ties,” the Basle Manifesto declared. 
 In the event of imperialist war breaking out, socialists “shall be bound to intervene for its being brought to a speedy end, and to employ all their forces for utilising the economical and political crisis created by the war, in order to rouse the masses of people and to hasten the downbreak of the pre-dominance of the capitalist class”. 
 When the world imperialist war broke out in July 1914, the major-ity of leaders of the socialist parties of the Second International betrayed the cause of socialism, went back on the Basle resolution and sided with their imperialist governments. 
 The Russian Bolshe-viks led by Lenin, as well as German Left Social-Democrats (Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg and others) and some groups in other socialist parties, remained true to the principles of internationalism and, in conformity with the Basle Manifesto, called upon the work-ers of their countries to fight against their own imperialist govern-ments and against the imperialist war.

 53 Party Week was conducted in accordance with the decision of the Eighth Party Congress to enlarge the Party membership. 
 It was car-ried out in a period of the intense struggle of the Soviet state against foreign military intervention and internal counter-revolution. 
 “To get our Party card in such conditions signified, to a certain extent, becoming a candidate to the Denikin gallows,” wrote Bulletin of the C.

 The first Party Week was held by the Petrograd Party organisation from August 10 to 17 (the second Party Week took place in October-November 1919); the Party Week in the Moscow Gubernia Party organisation was conducted from September 20 to 28. 
 At the end of September the Central Committee sent a circular letter to all Party organisations, in which it stated that as the re-registration and purge was over in 31 32almost all Party organisations the C. 
C. 
 considered it opportune to start admitting new members to the Party. 
 The C. 
C. 
 stressed that only men and women workers, Red Army men, sailors and peasant men and women should be admitted to the Party during Party Week. 
 In 38 gubernias of the European part of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 alone Party Week brought over 200,000 new members, of whom more than half were workers. 
 At the front up to 25 per cent of the army and navy personnel joined the Party. 
 Lenin wrote that workers and peasants who entered the Party at such a difficult period made up “a fine and reliable body of leaders of the revolutionary proletariat and of the non-exploiting section of the peasantry” (see p. 
 404 of this volume). 
 p. 
 63 The re-registration of Party members was held in May-September 1919 by decision of the Eighth Party Congress which pointed to its necessity and to the need for special measures of control in respect to those members who joined the Party after the October Socialist Revolution. 
 For this purpose a special instruction was worked out by the Central Committee. 
 It said, “The aim of the re-registration is to purge the Party of non-Communist elements, chiefly of persons who wormed their way into the Party because it is the ruling party and who use their position of Party members in their own interests” (Pravda No. 
 88, April 24, 1919). 
 During re-registration Party mem-bers were to return their Party cards, fill in the questionnaires, and submit the recommendations of two Party members who had been in the Party for not less than six months and whom the Party Commit-tee knew to be reliable Communists. 
 The admittance of new members to the Party was discontinued during re-registration. 
 Party members who were convicted of behaviour unworthy of Communists, or who violated Party decisions, or did not pay Party dues, or who proved to be deserters were liable to expulsion. 
 This re-registration was the first purge of the Party. 
 As a result Party discipline was strengthened, the Party links with the masses grew stronger and the member-ship and the fighting capacity of the Party improved.

 63 The Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna)—a reform-ist nationalist organisation founded in 1892. 
 In 1906 the party split into the P. 
S. 
P. 
 Left wing and the Right, chauvinist wing (the so-called “revolutionary faction”). 
 Under the influence of the Bolsheviks and the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania, the Left wing gradually adopted a consist-ent revolutionary stand. 
 During the First World War a considerable section of the P. 
S. 
P. 
 Left wing adopted an internationalist stand. 
 In December 1918 it united with the Social-Democrats of Poland and Lithuania to form the Communist Workers’ Party of Poland. 
 The P. 
S. 
P. 
 Right wing continued its policy of national chauvinism, and, after the estab-lishment of the Polish bourgeois state (1918), the Right P. 
S. 
P. 
 formed the Polish bourgeois government and supported the policy 33 34 35 36of the aggressive circles who started a war against Soviet Russia in 1920. 
 In 1919 the Right P. 
S. 
P. 
 resumed the name of P. 
S. 
P. 
 After Pilsudski’s fascist coup d’état (May 1926), the P. 
S. 
P. 
 was nominally a parliamentary opposition, but actually it did not carry on any active fight against the fascist regime, and continued its anti-Communist and anti-Soviet propaganda. 
 During that period the Left-wing elements of the P. 
S. 
P. 
 collaborated with the Polish Communists. 
 During the Second World War the P. 
S. 
P. 
 again split. 
 Its reaction-ary and chauvinist faction, which assumed the name “ Wolno 97, Równo 97, Niepodleg ^o97” (Liberty, Equality, Independence), took part in the reactionary Polish émigré government in London. 
 The Left faction, which called itself the Workers’ Party of Polish Social-ists, under the influence of the Polish Workers’ Party (P. 
W. 
P. 
), which was founded in 1942, joined the popular front against the nazi invaders, fought for Poland’s liberation, and pursued a policy of friendly relations with the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 In 1944, after the liberation of Poland’s eastern territories and the formation of a Polish Committee of National Liberation, the Workers’ Party of Polish Socialists resumed the name of P. 
S. 
P. 
 and together with the P. 
W. 
P. 
 participated in the building up of a people’s democratic Poland. 
 In December 1948 the P. 
W. 
P. 
 and the P. 
S. 
P. 
 amalgamated and formed the Polish United Workers’ Party.

 79 The Communist Party of Germany split at its Second Congress, held in October 1919, in Heidelberg. 
 It was attended by 46 delegates representing 16,000 party members. 
 The Congress recognised the error of the boycott tactics of the elections to the Constituent Assem-bly and passed a decision to take part in parliamentary elections. 
 A group of the “Lefts” came out at the Congress against its decisions and in defence of anarcho-syndicalist views—the boycott of parlia-ment, repudiation of the political struggle, refusal to work in reactionary trade unions and so on. 
 The “Lefts” were in the minor-ity and were expelled from the party, after which they founded the so-called Communist Workers’ Party of Germany. 
 Subsequently the C. 
W. 
P. 
G. 
 became an insignificant sectarian group without any influence in the working class. 
 Simultaneously with this letter addressed to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany Lenin sent a letter to the breakaway group too (see pp.

 The Railwaymen’s Executive Committee was dominated by Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 After the October Revolution, the Railwaymen’s Executive became one of the cen-tres of counter-revolution. 
 In January 1918 the All-Russia Extra-ordinary Congress of Railwaymen dismissed the Vikzhel and elect-ed the central body of the railwaymen’s union called Vikzhedor, which was composed mainly of Bolsheviks.

 It was vested with the powers of a state and Party body. 
 Its main tasks were to strengthen the union of the peoples of Turkestan with Soviet Russia, to consolidate Soviet power, to rectify mistakes in the nation-al policy in Turkestan, and to improve Party work. 
 The members of the commission were to follow the instruction of the All-Rus-sia Central Executive Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars of October 8, 1919, which pointed out that self-deter-mination of the peoples of Turkestan and the abolition of all national inequality and of the privileges of one nationality group at the expense of another form the basis of the policy of the Soviet Government of Russia and serve as the guiding principle in the entire work of all its bodies. 
 Only by such work can we overcome the old mistrust of the local working masses of Turkestan for the workers and peasants of Russia due to the many years of the rule of Russian tsarism. 
 The working people of Turkestan welcomed this decision of the All-Russia C.

C. 
 of our Party and the Third International. 
” In January 1920 Lenin’s letter was discussed at the Fifth General Territorial Conference of the Communist Party of Turkestan. 
 The Conference sent a letter to Lenin in which the Communists promised to rectify their blunders and render unanimous support to the Turkestan com-mission. 
 p. 
 138 The Central Committee’s letter was drafted by Lenin, and was pub-lished in Pravda on November 13. 
 The appeal of the C. 
C. 
 of the Par-ty met with a warm response in the country. 
 On November 14 the Communists of Red Presnya district in Moscow adopted a decision to hold a “fuel week” of communist labour and instructed all Party members to take part in subbotniks. 
 The Moscow City Party Com-mittee mobilised 200 Communists to the fuel front on November 18. 
 The Vladimir Gubernia Party Conference resolved to send hundreds of worker Communists to the countryside to mobilise the local popu-lation to supply fuel and horses to deliver it to the cities. 
 Labour enthusiasm in organising fuel supplies that swept the cities spread to the countryside. 
 The week from November 24 to December 1 was proclaimed “fuel week” by the Red Army. 
 Measures adopted by the Party led to the easing of the fuel crisis. 
 In October an average of 1,941 wagons were loaded per day and in December this figure rose to 2,895 wagonloads. 
 p. 
 139 The First All-Russia Conference on Party Work in the Countryside was held from November 16 to November 19, 1919, in Moscow. 
 50 51Representatives of all gubernia and regional Party Committees (except Orenburg, Urals, Don, Orel, Voronezh, Astrakhan and Archangel) and from many uyezd and some volost Party Committees attended the Conference. 
 The Conference was convened for the purpose of pooling experience of Party work in the countryside and for working out practical measures for its improvement. 
 The agenda of the Conference was the following: reports by local Party or-ganisations, report on organisational questions, work among peasant women and the peasant youth, cultural and educational work in the countryside, a newspaper for peasants, publishing literature for the countryside, Party Week in the countryside, and others. 
 The Conference approved the proposal submitted by the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) Rural Department to muster Party forces for work among the peasants, and also adopted, with some amendments, a draft in-struction for work in the countryside. 
 The Conference pointed out the necessity of drawing women into all spheres of state organisa-tion, and of drawing peasant youths into the All-Russia Commu-nist Youth League. 
 The Conference passed a decision to hold a Party Week in the countryside, and approved of the practice of con-vening non-party conferences. 
 On the first day the Conference adopted a decision to ask Lenin to take part in the Conference. 
 Lenin made a speech at the Confer-ence on November 18, in which he congratulated the delegates on the occasion of the liberation of Kursk by the Red Army.

 143 The Eighth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 (B. 
) was held March 18-23, 1919 in Moscow. 
 One of the most important questions discussed at the Congress was the attitude towards the middle peasants. 
 In all his speeches and particularly in his report on work in the countryside, Lenin explained the Party’s new policy in relation to the middle peasants—passing from the policy of neutralising the middle peasants to one of firm alliance with them, while relying on the poor peas-ants and carrying the struggle against the kulaks, and preserv-ing the leading role of the proletariat in that alliance. 
 That slogan had been advanced by Lenin in November 1918. 
 The Congress adopt-ed a “Resolution on the Attitude Towards the Middle Peasants” written by Lenin. 
 Lenin’s policy helped to strengthen the military and political alliance of the working class and the peasantry, and played a decisive role in achieving victory over the interventionists and whiteguards, and later on in building socialism by the joint efforts of workers and peasants.

 On the eve of the Congress, November 21, a preliminary meeting of the Central Committee members with a group of delegates was held with Lenin presiding. 
 The Congress was attended by 71 delegates with the right to vote and by 11 delegates with voice but no vote. 
 On the opening day of the Congress, November 22, Lenin delivered a report on the current situation. 
 The resolution adopted on his re-port was submitted to the presidium “for concretisation and draft-ing of the chief theses that should serve as a basis for work in the East”. 
 The Congress heard the report on the work of the Central Bureau of Communist Organisations of the Peoples of the East, reports from the localities, the reports of the Central Moslem War Collegium, Central Moslem Commissariat of the People’s Com-missariat of Nationalities; it discussed the national question of the Bashkirs and Tatars and heard reports of sections on state organisation and Party work, on work among women in the East and among the youth, etc. 
 The Congress outlined the tasks of the Party and the government in the East, and elected a new Central Bureau of Communist Organisations of the Peoples of the East. 
 p.

 On November 21, 1910, the Political Bureau of the C.

 163 On May 18, 1819 the joint meeting of the Ukrainian Central Ex-ecutive Committee and the Kiev Soviet of Workers’ Deputies, trade unions, factory committees and the Kiev Uyezd Congress of Peas-ant Deputies passed a resolution which stressed the necessity of uniting all the forces of the Soviet Republics for the armed struggle against the enemies of Soviet power and of concentrating material resources at a single centre. 
 The Ukrainian C. 
E. 
C. 
 instructed its Presidium to submit a proposal to the All-Russia C. 
E. 
C. 
 “to work out concrete forms for the organisation of a united front of revolu-tionary struggle”. 
 Similar proposals were submitted by the Soviet governments of Latvia, Lithuania and Byelorussia. 
 In compliance with the wishes expressed by the supreme bodies of Soviet Republics the All-Russia Central Executive Committee adopted a decree on June 1, 1919 “On the Union of the Soviet Republics of Russia, the Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Byelorus-sia for the Struggle Against World Imperialism”. 
 The decree said that, while fully recognising the independence, freedom and self-determination of the working people of the Ukraine, Latvia, Lithu-ania, Byelorussia and the Crimea ... the All-Russia Central Execu-tive Committee of Soviets considers it necessary to effect a close amalgamation of (1) military organisation and army command, (2) economic councils, (3) railways, (4) finances and (5) commissari-ats of labour of the Soviet Socialist Republics of Russia, the Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia and the Crimea so as to concentrate the management of these branches in single bodies. 
” This military and political alliance of the Soviet Socialist Republics was of tremendous significance in promoting victory over the interventionists and the internal counter-revolution. 
 p. 
 16352 53 The Conference was held in Moscow, and was attended by 45 dele-gates with the right to vote. 
 The agenda consisted of the following items: (1) Report of the C. 
C. 
, (2) Report on the international situa-tion; (3) The agenda of the Seventh All-Russia Congress of Soviets (state organisation); (4) Soviet power in the Ukraine; (5) The Party Rules; (6) Work with new Party members; (7) Fuel question. 
 Lenin directed the work of the Conference. 
 He made a speech at the opening session, delivered the political report of the C. 
C. 
 of the Party and closed the debate on it. 
 Lenin spoke on Soviet power in the Ukraine and closed the discussion on this subject. 
 The Con-ference delegates unanimously approved the C. 
C. 
 political line and organisational work. 
 Chicherin, People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, delivered a detailed report on the international situation explaining the foreign policy of the Soviet state and the efforts being made for the immediate conclusion of peace. 
 Another important question discussed at the Conference was state organisa-tion.

, R. 
C. 
P.

 Vladimirsky summed up the results in organising the Soviet state and submitted concrete proposals for amending the Constitution of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 Sapronov, Osinsky and their adherents opposed the C. 
C. 
 line; they rejected one-man management and demanded preser-vation of “the unlimited corporate principle”. 
 This group of opportunists tried to impose their views on the Conference which would have undermined centralism and the leading role of the Party in the Soviets. 
 The Conference rejected the views of Sapronov and his followers as being contrary to the interests of the Party, and approved Lenin’s principle of democratic central-ism in the organisation of government bodies and in the inter-relations of those bodies. 
 The Conference adopted a number of decisions directed at consol-idating the dictatorship of the proletariat and at involving working masses in Soviet state development. 
 The Conference adopted new Party Rules which contained a new section on “Candidates to Party Membership” introducing a proba-tionary period for all new members, the length of which depended on social category; it was two months for factory workers and peas-ants, and no less than six months for other categories. 
 A new section on “Groups in the Extra-Party Institutions and Organisations” was added to the Party Rules in order to spread Party influence to the extra-Party organisations and institutions, conduct them in accor-dance with the Party line and establish Party control over their activities. 
 The new Party Rules had a special section on “Party Discipline”, which stated that strict observance of Party discipline was the prime duty of all Party members and all Party organi-sations. 
 The Conference approved the “Theses on the Employment of New Party Members” which outlined measures to raise the educa-tional and ideological level of Communists, give them military train-ing, and strengthen Party discipline. 
 The Eighth Party Conference was of great significance; it summed up the experience gained by the54 Party in the two-year struggle to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and implement the decisions of the Eighth Party Con-gress. 
 The decisions of the Seventh All-Russia Congress of Soviets were based on the Conference’s decisions on state, economic and military organisation.

 The Congress was attended by 140 delegates, of whom 93 were Communists. 
 Lenin spoke on the second day of the Congress. 
 The Congress adopted the Rules of the All-Russia Association of Agricultural Producers’ Collectives (Communes and Artels) which were later endorsed by the People’s Commissariat of Agriculture. 
 The Rules stated that the main objects of the Association were the union of all agricultural collectives in a single producers’ association, propaganda of the idea of collective farming and practical help for the neighbouring peasantry, especially the poor peasants and the families of Red Army men.

 Grants and loans from this fund were given to farming communes, producers’ co-operatives and village societies and groups of peasants, provided they went over to collective farming. 
 The People’s Commissars of Agriculture and of Finance elaborated detailed rules for granting loans to de-velop agriculture (see Izvestia No.

 195 The Statute on Socialist Land Settlement and the Measures for the Transition to Socialist Farming was adopted by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee in February 1919. 
 It took for its basis the decisions of the First All-Russia Congress of Land63 64 65 66 67 Departments, Poor Peasants’ Committees and Communes held December 1918. 
 Lenin directly participated in drafting and editing the Statute. 
 It outlined a number of measures for the reconstruction of agriculture on a socialist basis, for raising agricultural produc-tivity and extending the areas under crops. 
 The Statute reads, “In order to put an end to all exploitation of man by man, to reconstruct agriculture on a socialist basis, to apply all the achievements of science and technology, to educate the working masses in the spirit of socialism and to unite the proletariat and poor peasants in their struggle against capital, it is necessary to go over from individual to collective forms of land tenure. 
 Large state farms and communes, collective tilling and other types of collective work are the best ways of attaining this purpose, therefore all forms of individual land tenure should be regarded as transitory and outliving themselves” (Izvestia No. 
 34, February 14, 1919).

 195 The Seventh All-Russia Congress of Soviets was held in Moscow. 
 It was attended by 1,366 delegates (1,002 with the right to vote and 364 with voice but no vote), of them 1,278 Communists. 
 The agenda of the Congress was the following: (1) Report of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee and the Council of People’s Commis-sars, (2) War Situation, (3) the Communist International, (4) Food Situation, (5) Fuel Question, (6) Work of Soviet Bodies in the Centre and the Provinces, (7) Elections to the All-Russia Central Execu-tive Committee.

; on the following day he closed the debate on the report, on December 8 he took part in a discussion of the report on the work of Soviet bodies at the session of the organisation section and on December 9 he made a speech closing the Congress. 
 Lenin introduced addenda to the draft resolution on Soviet organisation. 
 The Congress of Soviets approved the home and foreign policy of the Soviet Government. 
 The detailed discussion of the reports on Soviet organisation, the food situation and the fuel question was entrusted to respective sections in view of their practical importance. 
 The draft resolutions on the reports submitted by the sections were approved by the closing plenary meeting of the Congress on December 9. 
 The resolution on “Soviet Organisation” envisaged the further consolidation of Soviet government bodies, and gave an exact formulation of their rights and duties in the centre and in the provinces. 
 On Lenin’s proposal the Congress adopted a resolution on peace and an appeal to the governments of Britain, France, the U. 
S. 
A. 
, Italy and Japan to begin peace negotiations (see p. 
 231 of this volume). 
 The Congress of Soviets passed a resolution on “Oppressed Nations” in which it once again confirmed the principles of the Soviet national policy. 
 In a special resolution the Congress expressed its indignation at the reign of White Terror in Hungary. 
 The Congress greeted the foundation of the Third International and stressed its tremendous international significance.

 211 The Dreyfus case —a provocative trial engineered in 1894 by reac-tionary French militarists. 
 Dreyfus, a Jewish officer of the French General Staff, was sentenced to life imprisonment by a court martial on a clearly fictitious charge of espionage and high treason. 
 The trial was used by reactionary circles in France to incite anti-Semi-tism and to attack the republican regime and democratic liberties. 
 When socialists and prominent bourgeois democrats (Émile Zola, Jean Jaurès, Anatole France and others) launched a campaign in 1898 for a review of the Dreyfus case, it immediately became a political issue and split the country into two camps—republicans and democrats on one side and the bloc of royalists, clericals, anti-Semites and nationalists on the other. 
 In 1899 Dreyfus was pardoned and released under pressure of public opinion, but it was not until 1906 that the Court of Cassation found him not guilty and reinstated him in the army.

 221 Cheka (the All-Russia Extraordinary Commission) was set up on December 7 (20), 1917 by a decision of the Council of People’s Commissars for the purpose of “ruthlessly combating counter-revo-lution, sabotage and profiteering”. 
 As one of the most important levers of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the All-Russia Extra-ordinary Commission played an important part in checking coun-ter-revolutionary sabotage and in protecting the security of the Soviet Republic. 
 Appraising the work of this commission, Lenin pointed out in his report to the Ninth All-Russia Congress of Sovi-ets in December 1921, “...this is the institution which has been our effective weapon against the innumerable conspiracies, against the innumerable attacks on Soviet power”. 
 In its resolution on the All-Russia Extraordinary Commission the Ninth Congress noted the commission’s heroic work in protecting the gains of the October Revolution and, in view of the consolidation of Soviet power, pro-posed curtailing the commission’s activity.

 It consisted mainly of semi-proletarian Jewish artisans of Western Russia. 
 During the First World War (1914-18), the Bundists took a social-chauvinist stand. 
 In 1917 the Bund supported the bourgeois Provisional Government and sided with the enemies of the Great October Socialist Revolution. 
 During the foreign military inter-vention and the Civil War, the Bund leaders made common causewith the counter-revolutionary forces. 
 At the same time a tendencytowards co-operation with the Soviets became apparent among theBund rank and file. 
 In March 1921 the Bund dissolved itself.

 233 Lenin refers to the counter-revolutionary conspiracy exposed in Petrograd in November 1919. 
 The conspiracy was organised by acounter-revolutionary organisation linked up with Yudenich andsubsidised by the Entente. 
 Among its members were tsarist high of-ficials, generals and admirals of the tsarist army and navy, Cadets, and people associated with the S. 
R.

 They aimed at timing their revolt to Yudenich’s offensive on Petrograd andsetting up a whiteguard government.

 243 The Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany —a Centrist party formed in April 1917 at the inaugural congress in Gotha. 
It advocated unity with social-chauvinists and went as far as todeny the class struggle. 
 Kautsky’s group ( Arbeitsgemeinschaft ) in Reichstag formed the core of the party. 
 In October 1920 a split took place at a party congress in Halle. 
 A considerable section of the par-ty united with the Communist Party of Germany in December 1920and the Right wing formed a separate party, retaining its old name. 
It existed till 1922.

 258 Centrists , Centrism —a variety of opportunism in the labour movement, hostile to Marxism-Leninism. 
 It arose in Social-Demo-cratic parties of the Second International prior to the First WorldWar. 
 The Centrists used Marxist phrases and posed as “orthodox Marxists”, but in fact emasculated Marxism of its revolutionarycontent, and tried to retain the influence of open opportunism and hence of the bourgeoisie over the workers. 
 The ideology of Centrism is the ideology of adaptation, of the subordination of theclass interests of the proletariat to those of the bourgeoisie. 
 Leninsaid that Centrism was much more dangerous, much more harmful74 75 76 77 to the working-class movement than open opportunism; he described Centrism as “the social product of the contradictions within theSecond International, a blend of loyalty to Marxism in word, and p. 
 312). 
 During the First World War the Centrists supported the policy of the opportunists, the social-chauvinists and at the same time they advanced pacifist slogans, in this way diverting the workers fromthe revolutionary struggle against the imperialist war. 
 Kautsky wasone of the chief theoreticians of Centrism. 
 Centrism in Russia was represented by Trotsky, Martov, Chkheidze and others. 
 The Bolshevik Party headed by Lenin was an irreconcilable and consistent fighter against Centrism, against its Russian and inter-national varieties. 
 Exposing Centrism in Russia, the Bolshevikshelped the revolutionary elements in the parties of the Second In-ternational to get rid of Centrism, to break with the opportunists and to found genuinely Marxist, Communist Parties.

 265 This refers to the civil war waged by the Finnish bourgeoisie against the proletarian revolution in Finland. 
 The revolution began in themiddle of January 1918 in the southern industrial districts of thecountry. 
 On January 15 (28),1918 the Finnish Red Guard capturedthe capital—Helsingfors (Helsinki), and the bourgeois governmentof Svinhufvud was overthrown. 
 The workers seized power and set up a revolutionary government known as the Council of People’s Representatives; among its members were O. 
 Kuusinen, J. 
 Sirola,A. 
 Taimi. 
 Seims of workers’ organisations formed the basic type ofstate power in the country. 
 Lenin called them a new type of power,“proletarian power” (see present edition, Vol. 
 27, p. 
 133). 
 Amongthe most important steps taken by the workers’ government were the adoption of a law on the transfer without compensation of the lands tilled by the peasants to their ownership, exemption fromtaxation of the poor sections of the population, expropriation of theenterprises the owners of which had fled from the country, the es-tablishment of state control over private banks (their functionswere transferred to the state bank).

 During the First World War of 1914-18 they held Centrist views and pursued a conciliatory policy towards the social-chauvinists. 
 The Longuetists rejected revolutionary struggle and advocated “defence of the fatherland” in the imperialist war Lenin called them petty-bourgeois nationalists (see present edition; Vol.

 After the victory of the October Socialist Revo-lution, the Longuetists declared that they supported the dictator-ship of the proletariat, but in practice they were against it.

 The Conference discussed the convocation of an All-Russia Party Conference, the fuel problem, subbotniks, measures of combating typhus epidemics, the food situation in Moscow, uni-versal military training, and special detachments. 
 A resolution on subbotniks underscored their tremendous sig-nificance as the first practical steps in building communism. 
 The Party Conference recognised the great importance of subbotniks in achieving tangible results in raising labour productivity and in alleviating the transport, fuel, food and other crises of the Soviet Republic and made it incumbent upon all Party members to take part in subbotniks and make their work the most productive. 
 After Lenin’s report the Conference heard the report on the organisation of subbotniks and approved an instruction. 
 The Moscow Party Committee worked out and approved the “Statute on Sub-botniks” published in Pravda on December 27, 1919.

 283 The Third , Communist International (Comintern ) was founded at the First (Inaugural) Congress of the Comintern held March 2-6, 1919. 
 It was attended by 52 delegates, of whom 34 had the right to vote and 18 with voice but no vote. 
 These delegates represented the Communist Parties of Russia, Germany, German Austria, Hungary,82 83 84 85 Poland, Finland, the Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia, Estonia, Armenia, of the Volga Region Germans, the Swedish Left Social-Democratic Party, the Norwegian Social-Democratic Party, the Swiss Social-Democratic Party (the Opposition), the Balkan Revolutionary Social-Democratic Federation, the united group of the peoples of the East of Russia, the French Zimmerwald Left wing, the Czech, Bulgarian, Yugoslav, British, French and Swiss Communist groups, the Dutch Social-Democratic group, the Ameri-can League of Socialist Propaganda, the Socialist Labor Party of America, the Chinese Socialist Labour Party, the Korean Workers’ Union, the Turkestan, Turkish, Georgian, Azerbaijan and Persian sections of the Central Bureau of the Peoples of the East and the Zimmerwald Commission. 
 The first session passed a decision “to consider this meeting as the international communist conference”, and adopted the following agenda: (1) inauguration, (2) reports, (3) platform of the international communist conference, (4) bourgeois democracy and the dicta-torship of the proletariat, (5) Berne Conference and the attitude towards socialist trends, (6) international situation and the policy of the Entente, (7) the Manifesto, (8) the White Terror, (9) elections of the Bureau and miscellaneous organisational questions. 
 The central item in the work of the conference was Lenin’s theses and report on bourgeois democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 The conference unanimously expressed its agreement with Lenin’s theses and passed a decision to refer them to the Bureau for the widest distribution in various countries. 
 The conference also adopted the resolution proposed by Lenin as a supplement to the theses. 
 On March 4, after the conference had endorsed Lenin’s theses and passed a resolution on Lenin’s report, it passed a decision to “cons-titute itself as the Third International and assume the name of the Communist International”. 
 On the same day the Congress unani-mously proclaimed the dissolution of the Zimmerwald Left. 
 On March 4, it approved the platform of the Communist International, main planks of which were: (1) the inevitability of the transition from capitalism to communism, (2) the necessity of a revolutionary struggle of the proletariat for the overthrow of bourgeois govern-ments, (3) the abolition of the bourgeois state and its substitution by a state of a new type, the proletarian state, a state of the Soviet type, which will ensure the transition to a communist society. 
 One of the most important Congress documents was the Manifesto to the world proletariat, which stated that the Communist In-ternational was the successor of the ideas of Marx and Engels es-pressed in the Communist Manifesto . 
 The Congress called upon the workers of all countries to support Soviet Russia, demanded non-interference of the Entente in the internal affairs of the Republic of Soviet, withdrawal of the interventionist troops from the territory of Russia, recognition of the Soviet state, cessation of the economic blockade and restoration of trade relations. 
 In the resolution on “The Attitude Towards ‘Socialist’ Trends and the Berne Conference” the Congress condemned the attempts to restore the Second International, which was “a tool in the hands of the bourgeoisie” and declared that the revolutionary proletariat had nothing in common with that conference. 
 The Third International played a great role in exposing opportun-ism in the labour movement, in restoring contacts between the working people of various countries, in founding and strengthen-ing the Communist Parties.

 294 The Borotba Party (see Note 64) assumed the name of the Ukrainian Communist Party of Borotbists in August 1919. 
 It was led by V. 
 Blakitny, G. 
 Grinko, A. 
 Shumsky and others. 
 In the party there were a few counter-revolutionary Petlyura adherents who disguised their real stand by revolutionary phrases, declarations of recognition of the communist programme but in fact were against the dic-tatorship of the proletariat and pursued a policy directed at split-ting the single revolutionary front of the working peoples of Russia and the Ukraine. 
 The Borotbists addressed the Executive of the Comintern twice with a request to be admitted to the membership and be recognised as the main Communist Party in the Ukraine. 
 On February 26, 1920, the Communist International passed a special decision on this question, in which it proposed to the Borotbists to dissolve their party and merge with the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Ukraine. 
 The resolution said that the Executive of the Commu-nist International could only regard the attempt to found a second, parallel party as an attempt to split the ranks of the working people. 
 On account of the growing influence of the Bolsheviks among the peasantry and the successes of the Soviet government in the Ukraine, the Borotbists had to pass a decision on voluntary dissolution. 
 The Fourth Conference of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Ukraine, held March 17-23, 1920, agreed to admit the Borot-86 87 88 bists into its ranks. 
 Later on however, many Borotbists resumed their anti-Soviet activity, and headed the struggle of the counter-revolutionary, bourgeois-nationalist elements in the Ukraine.

 298 The First Congress of Women Workers and Peasants of Petrograd Gubernia was held January 15-16, 1920. 
 It was attended by 403 delegates, of whom 157 were Communists and 246 non-party; among them were 91 peasant women, 131 workers, 133 intellectu-als, 15 dressmakers, 11 housewives and two militia women. 
 Though the non-party delegates constituted the majority, the Congress was communist in spirit. 
 The agenda was as follows: the present situa-tion, the Communist Party and its attitude to women workers and peasants, the land question, the consumers’ commune, social edu-cation, etc. 
 On the opening day a telegram of greetings from Lenin was read out to which the Congress sent a reply. 
 Yelena Stasova greeted the Congress on behalf of the C.

 She stressed the importance of the coming “week for the front” and called upon women delegates to strain every effort to restore normal life to the country. 
 The Congress demonstrated the striving of the women work-ers and peasants to take an active part in building up the Soviet Republic.

 On February 7, 1920 the All-Russia Central Executive Committee endorsed the Rules for the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection according to which the state control bodies were reorganised “into a single body of socialist control by workers and peasants”. 
 Lenin attached great importance to workers’ and peasants’ inspec-tion. 
 In the articles written in 1923, “How We Should Reorganise the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection” and “Better Fewer, but Better”, Lenin proposed to unite the workers’ and peasants’ inspec-tion bodies with the Central Control Commission. 
 In April 1923, the Twelfth Party Congress adopted a decision that followed Lenin’s proposal to found a joint body with Party and state control func-tions. 
 At the time of the Stalin cult Lenin’s principles of the organisa-tion of Party and state control were grossly violated and a bureauc-ratic control apparatus was substituted for the Leninist system of control.

 The republic was formed on March 21, 1919 and in August 1919 was crushed by the united efforts of the imperialist intervention and internal counter-revolu-tion. 
 p. 
 303 This refers to the negotiations between Britain and France and the small bourgeois states, neighbours of the Soviet Republic, concern-ing a joint and simultaneous attack on Soviet Russia. 
 According to Churchill “fourteen states” were to take part in the campaign (see Note 11). 
 The initiators of the campaign planned to capture Petrograd and Moscow in December 1919. 
 But the campaign failed, although, as Lenin pointed out, “all kinds of pressure—financial, food, military—have been applied to force Estonia, Finland, and no doubt Latvia, Lithuania and Poland as well, to force that whole group of states to make war on us” (see p. 
 175 of this volume). 
 The bourgeois governments of the Baltic states avoided active participation in hostilities against Soviet Russia, because the Soviet Republic repeatedly proposed peace and did not violate the sover-eignty and independence of the small states which formerly belonged to the Russian Empire, whereas Kolchak and Denikin proclaimed the slogan of “a united and indivisible” Russia. 
 In addition, the participation of the Baltic states in the anti-Soviet campaign was hindered by the protests of the people who came out for the ces-sation of the war against Soviet Russia and for the conclusion of a peace treaty. 
 In autumn 1919 the British Government, the initiator and inspirer of the campaign, had to withdraw its troops from Archangel under the pressure of the British workers, and on January 16, 1920, the Allied Council resolved to lift the economic blockade and resume trade and commercial relations with the “population of Soviet Russia”.

 303 These documents were written by Lenin during the conference on co-operatives held on January 26, 1920. 
 They formed the basis of the decree of the Council of People’s Commissars of January 27, 1920 on “The Unification of All Types of Co-operative Organisa-tions”. 
 The decree envisaged the fusion of the credit and savings co-oper-atives, their district, gubernia and regional societies, with consum-ers’ co-operatives and their societies. 
 The All-Russia Central Board of Agricultural, Trades and Other Co-operative Societies merged with the Central Union of Consumers’ Societies (Tsentrosoyuz) as its affiliated sections. 
 The Chief Committee for Co-operatives set up at the People’s Commissariat of Food was to supervise all activities. 
 On the same day, January 27, 1920, the Council of People’s Commissars issued a decree on “The Abolition of Councils of Co-operative Congresses” in view of the merger of all-Russia co-oper-ative centres with the Tsentrosoyuz and the amalgamation of the92 93 94 credit and consumers’ co-operatives; the functions and property of the all-Russia and gubernia councils of co-operative congresses were transferred to the Tsentrosoyuz and its branches.

 307 The Third All-Russia Congress of Economic Councils was held in Moscow, January 23-29, 1920. 
 It was attended by some 500 delegates and included workers from large industrial enterprises and representatives of trade unions and gubernia economic councils. 
 The Congress agenda was the following: the economic situation in Soviet Russia; the war industry and Red Army supplies; organisa-tion of economic management; organisation of labour; labour con-scription transport; the fuel problem and others. 
 On January 27 Lenin delivered a speech at a plenary session. 
 The Congress adopted the theses of the C. 
C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) on “Mobilisation of the Industrial Proletariat, Labour Conscription, Militarisation of the Economy and Utilisation of Army Units for the Needs of the Economy”. 
 In its decisions the Congress stressed the need to maintain the cen-tralised management of the country’s economy, Simultaneously local economic councils were granted greater independence in eco-nomic activities. 
 The Third Congress of Economic Councils drew up a plan for the further rehabilitation and development of the economy of the Soviet Republic. 
 p. 
 309 The transition of nationalised enterprises and branches of economy to one-man management started in the spring of 1918; by this time the working class had acquired certain experience in management, the first Soviet business executives had been trained in workers control bodies and elective collegiums. 
 Lenin formulated the theo-retical grounds for the one-man management of production coupled with extensive enrolment of working people into economic manage-ment in his article “The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government” published on April 28, 1918. 
 At the end of 1919 when questions of economic organisation came to the fore, a discussion was held in the Party on the corporate or one-man management of enterprises. 
 The so-called group of Demo-cratic Centralism (T. 
 V. 
 Sapronov, N. 
 Osinsky [V. 
 V. 
 Obolensky], V. 
 N. 
 Maximovsky, V. 
 M. 
 Smirnov and others) came out against the Leninist principle of one-man management and in favour of corporate management. 
 They were supported by the Moscow Guber-nia Party Committee. 
 At the Kharkov Gubernia Party Conference the Democratic Centralists succeeded in carrying a resolution against one-man management. 
 At the Fourth Conference of the C. 
P. 
(B. 
) of the Ukraine, held March 17-23, 1920, the vote was split evenly. 
 The Ninth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) put an end to this discus-sion. 
 Its resolution on “The Immediate Tasks of Economic Develop-ment” underscored that “the main task in organisation of manage-ment is setting up competent, firm and efficient management for every individual industrial enterprise and for an industry as a whole”. 
 The Congress resolved “to approximate the management of production to one-man management, that is, to introduce unre-95 96 stricted one-man management in factory shops and departments, set the goal of one-man management in factory administrations and reduce collegiums at medium and high levels of production admin-istration”.

E. 
C. 
; international situation; economic policy in connection with the organisation of labour and supplies; labour mobilisation and utilisation of the Army; transport; food problem; Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection; peace negotiations with Estonia, and other questions. 
 On February 2, Lenin delivered a report on the work of the All-Russia C. 
E. 
C. 
 and the Council of people’s Commissars. 
 The session endorsed the Rules for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, according to which the People’s Commis-sariat of State Control was to be reorganised into workers’ and peas-ants’ inspection with the enrolment of broad masses of workers and peasants into this work. 
 The session passed a resolution on “Trans-port” which stated that the restoration of transport and improve-ment of its work were the primary task of the Soviet government. 
 Another resolution underscored the tremendous importance of the electrification of the economy. 
 The session endorsed the appeal to the Polish people and resolved to ratify the peace treaty with Esto-nia.

 315 Lenin read the report published in the central newspapers of January 18, 1920, that the governments of the Entente countries intended to lift the blockade and sanction trade with Soviet Russia. 
 The decision passed by the Allied Council on January 16, 1920 stressed however that these measures did not mean any change in the policy of the Allied governments towards the Soviet Government.

 in respect of Poland proceeded from the principle of the right of nations to self-determination and unreserved recognition of the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Poland. 
 The Soviet Government confirmed that it had no aggressive designs against Poland. 
 On February 2, 1920, a meeting of the First Session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, Seventh Convocation, endorsed an appeal to the Polish people. 
 This appeal exposed the lies spread by the imperialist powers that Soviet Russia intended annexing parts of Poland, and stressed the Soviet Government’s unwavering effort to achieve peace and establish friendly, good-neighbourly relations with indepen-dent Poland.

 The decree on labour conscription and the Statute of the Com-mittees for Labour Conscription were adopted by the Council of People’s Commissars on January 29, 1920. 
 p. 
 333 The plan for the electrification of all Russia was the first scien-tifically based, long-term state plan for the rehabilitation and devel-opment of the economy of the Soviet Republic. 
 It was elaborated by the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia (GOELRO) in 1920 on Lenin’s instructions. 
 The plan was calculated for 10 to 15102 103 104 105 106 years and provided for the building of 20 thermal power stations (Kizel, Kashira, Shterovka and others) and 10 hydropower stations (on the Dnieper, Svir, Volkhov and other rivers); total planned capacity was 1. 
5 million kw. 
 The total yearly output of electric power was to be 8,800 million kwh; in 1913 Russia produced 1,900 million kwh. 
 The plan envisaged rational, proportionate deploy-ment of industry throughout the country. 
 It envisaged an increase of 80-100 per cent in industrial output over the 1913 level, and a huge increase over the 1920 level. 
 The GOELRO plan was in the main completed by 1931. 
 The output of electric power in the U.

 in the proletarian revolution; public health services; food problem. 
 The Conference was held at a time when transport was the main sector of the labour front. 
 The supply of raw material and fuel to fac-tories and food for the population depended on the work of the rail-ways. 
 In a very short time thousands of locomotives and trucks and many railway lines and bridges had to be repaired. 
 The Party mobi-lised Communists and assigned them to work on the railways. 
 Lenin delivered the opening speech at this Conference. 
 The resolution adopted by the Conference proposed to concentrate the entire atten-tion of the country and the efforts of the working class on the in-ternal development of Soviet Russia and particularly on the indust-rial and economic front. 
 The Conference called upon all railwaymen to form “the Red Labour Transport Army with strict labour discip-line”.

 p. 
 352 The French Socialist Party was founded in 1905 by the merger of the Socialist Party of France led by Guesde and the French Social-ist Party led by Jaurès. 
 On the outbreak of the imperialist war, the party leadership took a chauvinist stand. 
 It openly supported the imperialist war, and justified participation in the bourgeois government. 
 The Centrist wing, led by Longuet, took a social-paci-fist line and a conciliatory attitude towards the social-chauvinists. 
 The Left, revolutionary wing, consisting mainly of the rank and file, adhered to internationalist positions. 
 After the October Revolution in Russia, a sharp struggle unfold-ed in the party between the open reformists and Centrists, on the one hand, and the Left, revolutionary wing, which grew more influential thanks to the influx into the party of rank-and-file workers on the other. 
 At the party congress held in Tours in December 1920 the revolutionary wing received the majority vote. 
 The congress passed a decision to join the Communist International, and founded the Communist Party of France. 
 The majority of reformists and Centrists split away from the party and founded an independent party that retained the old name of the French Socialist Party.

 At present it is the organ of the French General Con-federation of Labour ( Confédération générale du Travail ).

 352 Communist International —a periodical, organ of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, published from May 1, 1919 to June 1943 in Russian, English, French, German, Spanish and Chinese. 
 The journal carried theoretical articles and documents of the Communist International, including a number of articles by Lenin. 
 The journal treated questions of Marxist-Leninist theory in the light of the problems of the international workers’ and commu-nist movement, published articles on the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and carried on a struggle against various anti-Leninist trends. 
 Its publication ceased owing to the decision of the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comin-tern of May 15, 1943 to dissolve the Communist International. 
 p. 
 352 This refers to the international political strike planned for July 21, 1919 under the slogans of support for the Russian and Hungarian revolutions and demand of non-interference on the part of the imperialist governments in Russian and Hungarian internal affairs. 
 Separate strikes took place on the appointed day in Britain, Italy, Germany, Norway, and other countries. 
 But this action by the proletariat of various countries lacked unity. 
112 113 114 115 116 The Right-wing leaders of socialist parties and trade unions did everything to prevent the international strike. 
 The conduct of French social-collaborators was treacherous. 
 To mislead the workers, Léon Jouhaux, Alphonse Merrheim and other leaders of the General Confederation of Labour expressed in favour of the strike, but on the eve of the strike they proposed to postpone it, and in this way prevented it.

 352 Avanti! (Forward!)— a daily newspaper, Central Organ of the Italian Socialist Party, founded in December 1896 in Rome. 
 During the First World War the newspaper took an inconsistent internation-alist stand and did not break off relations with the reformists. 
 In 1926 it was suppressed by Mussolini’s fascist government, but continued to appear abroad. 
 Since 1943 it has again been published in Italy.

 368 The League of Nations —an international organisation which exist-ed between the First and Second World wars. 
 It was founded in 1919 at the Paris Peace Conference of the victor countries. 
 Its Charter formed part of the Versailles Peace Treaty and was signed by 44 states. 
 The working bodies of the League of Nations were the Assembly, the League of Nations Council and the permanent Secre-tariat headed by the Secretary General. 
 The League Charter was calculated to create the impression that the organisation had as its aims the struggle against aggression, the reduction of armaments and the strengthening of peace and security. 
 In reality the leaders of the League of Nations shielded aggressors, and instigated the arms drive and preparations for a second world war. 
 Between 1920 and 1934 the League’s activities were hositile to the Soviet Union. 
 During 1920-21 it was one of the centres of the organisation of armed intervention against Soviet Russia. 
 On September 15, 1934, on the initiative of French diplomats, thirty-four member states of the League approached the Soviet Union with an invitation to join the organisation. 
 The U.

 joinedthe League of Nations in order to carry on the struggle for peace but its attempts to establish a peace front encountered the resist-ance of the reactionary circles of the Western powers. 
 From the begin-ning of the Second World War the League of Nations in effect ceased to exist. 
 The formal decision to dissolve the League was taken at a specially convened Assembly in April 1946. 
 p. 
 374 Lenin here refers to Proletcult (Proletarian Culture Organisation) formed in September 1917 as an independent workers’ cultural and educational organisation. 
 After the October Revolution A. 
 A. 
 Bog-danov and other leaders of the Proletcult continued to uphold its “independence” and thus counterposed it to the interests of the pro-letarian state. 
 As a result, bourgeois intellectuals made their way into the organisation and began to influence it. 
 The Proletcult members practically rejected the cultural legacy of previous gene-rations, strove to cut themselves off from mass cultural and educa-tional work, isolated themselves from life and advocated the need to create a special “proletarian culture” by “laboratory methods”. 
 Bogdanov, the main ideologist of the Proletcult, recognised Marx-ism in words, but actually advocated subjective idealism and Machism. 
 The Proletcult was not a homogeneous organisa-tion. 
 Besides bourgeois intellectuals who made up the leadership of many of its organisations, there was also working youth who sin-cerely wanted to help the cultural development of the Soviet state. 
 The Proletcult organisations made progress in 1919, but in the early123 124 125 twenties they went into decline. 
 In 1932 the Proletcult ceased to exist. 
 Lenin sharply criticised its erroneous principles in a draft resolu-tion on “Proletarian Culture” (see present edition, Vol. 
 31, “On Proletarian Culture”) and in a number of other works. 
 p. 
 378 The First All-Russia Congress of Working Cossacks was held Feb-ruary 29-March 6, 1920. 
 It was attended by 339 delegates from nearly all Cossack regions. 
 The agenda of the Congress was the following: Soviet development in Cossack regions; food policy; organisation of national economy, etc. 
 Lenin took part in the work of the Congress, and showed the true road for the working Cossacks in his speech on March 1. 
 The Congress denounced the attempts of the upper strata of Cossacks, in company with the landowners and bourgeoisie, to separate the Cossacks from the common cause of all the working people. 
 The Congress resolution stressed that the chief task of the working Cossacks was to unite with the workers and peasants of Soviet Russia. 
 The Congress expressed in favour of the participation of working Cossacks in Soviet governmental bodies on the same con-ditions as all workers and peasants, called upon the Cossacks to strengthen the union of workers and peasants and concentrate all efforts on overcoming the economic devastation in the country. 
 p. 
 380 Lenin refers to the Decree on Peace adopted by the Second All-Rus-sia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies on October 26 (November 8), 1917 (see present edition, Vol. 
 26, pp. 
 249-53). 
 The Decree on Peace proposed to all belligerent nations and their governments that they immediately sign an armistice and start negotiations on a just democratic peace. 
 p. 
 383 Lenin refers to a strike of workers in Germany which began on January 28, 1918 in protest against the rapacious peace terms pro-posed by the German delegation during the Brest-Litovsk peace talks. 
 Over 500,000 workers at armaments factories went on strike. 
 The strikers demanded peace without annexations and indemnities as proposed by the Soviet delegation, the participation of worker representatives of all countries in peace talks, the repeal of the war-time laws in the country and granting of democratic civil rights to the people. 
 The workers of Hamburg, Kiel, Leipzig, the Ruhr region and other industrial centres also went on strike. 
 All in all, over 1,000,000 people took part in the January political strike. 
 Arbeiterräte were set up in a number of cities during the strike. 
 At the head of the strike were revolutionary stewards elected by workers mainly from among the active trade unionists. 
 However, the majority of revolutionary stewards were members of the Independent Social-Democratic Party, the activities of which were directed by collaborators. 
 This weakened the forces of the strikers. 
 Though the January political strike ended in the defeat of the workers, its significance was very great. 
 Lenin considered that this, strike “marks a turn of sentiment among the German proletariat” (see present edition, Vol. 
 27, p. 
 546).

 The decree was en-dorsed by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on December 22, 1917 (January 4, 1918). 
 p. 
 388 Lenin refers to the preparations for a military-monarchist putsch in Germany. 
 The leader of the German reactionaries, Kapp, gave his name to the revolt known as the “Kapp putsch” to which the Social-Democratic government offered no resistance. 
 On March 13, 1920, army units were moved to Berlin and meeting with no resis-tance from the government declared it dissolved and set up a mili-tary junta. 
 The German working class responded with a general strike and on March 17, under pressure from the working class, Kapp’s government fell and state power again passed into the hands of the Social-Democrats, who by deceit succeeded in frustrating the general strike.

 435 The Ninth Party Congress was held in Moscow from March 29 to April 5, 1920. 
 The Congress opened in the Bolshoi Theatre with an introductory speech by Lenin. 
 The following meetings of the Con-gress took place in one of the buildings of the Kremlin. 
 Present at the Congress were 715 delegates, of whom 553 had the right to vote and 162 were delegates with voice but no vote; they represented 611,973 Party members. 
 At the Congress there were delegates from the Party organisations of Central Russia, the Ukraine, Urals Siberia and of other districts recently liberated by the Red Army. 
 Many delegates came to the Congress straight from the front. 
 The Congress adopted the following agenda: (1) Report of the Central Committee; (2) Immediate tasks of economic development; (3) Trade union movement; (4) Organisational questions; (5) Tasks of the Communist International; (6) Attitude to the co-operatives; (7) Transition to the militia system; (8) Election to the Central Com-mittee; (9) Other business. 
 Lenin guided the work of the Congress. 
 He delivered the report on the political work of the Central Committee and closed the debate on the report. 
 He also spoke on economic development and on co-135 136 137 138 operation, and made the speech on the closing of the Congress. 
 He submitted a proposal on the list of candidates for membership to the C. 
C. 
 In its resolution “The Immediate Tasks of Economic Construc-tion” the Congress pointed out that “the basic condition of economic rehabilitation of the country is steady implementation of the single economic plan for the coming historical epoch”. 
 The Ninth Congress directives were taken as the basis for a plan by the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia (GOELRO), the final draft of which was approved in December 1920 by the All-Russia Congress of Soviets. 
 It was the first long-term scien-tific plan in history for the economic development of a vast country; it was calculated to create the production and technical basis of socialism. 
 Special attention was devoted to the organisation of production management. 
 The resolution on the question pointed out the neces-sity of competent, firm and energetic one-man management. 
 The Congress emphasised the importance of utilising the achieve-ments of science, technology and culture in the interests of social-ist economy. 
 The Congress put forward the task of enlisting special-ists into the sphere of production and of establishing the atmosphere of comradely co-operation between workers and specialists. 
 The anti-Party group of Democratic Centralists (Sapronov, Osin-sky, V. 
 Smirnov and others) opposed the Party line on economic de-velopment. 
 Using phrases about democratic centralism, this group spoke against the use of specialists, against centralised state admini-stration, against one-man management and the personal responsibil-ity of managers of enterprises; they insisted on unlimited corporate management. 
 That group was supported at the Congress by Rykov, Tomsky, Milyutin, and Lomov, who also spoke against the principle of one-man management and claimed that corporate management was the only principle of management of industry from the Supreme Economic Council down to the management of a single factory. 
 The Congress resolutely denounced the democratic centralism group and rejected their anti-Party proposals. 
 Another important question discussed at the Congress was that of trade unions in connection with the adaptation of their work for economic tasks. 
 The Congress severely criticised anarcho-syndical-ist elements (Shlyapnikov, Lozovsky, Tomsky, Lutovinov), who advocated the “independence” of trade unions and counterposed them to the Communist Party and the Soviet power. 
 Guided by Lenin’s teaching the Congress pointed out that the trade unions, as school of communism, should organise the proletarian masses, train them in the work of management, raise their cultural and political level to the standards of communism, and prepare them for the role of ac-tive builders of communism. 
 At its closed meeting on April 4, the Congress elected a new Cen-tral Committee of 19 members and 12 alternate members.

 439 Lenin refers to the savage terror resorted to by the Finnish bour-geoisie to suppress the proletarian revolution in 1918. 
 Over 90,000 people were imprisoned or sent to concentration camps, nearly 18,000 were executed and nearly as many died of hunger or tor-tures. 
 The number of victims of White Terror ten times exceeded the number of Finnish workers killed in the battles for the revolution. 
 p. 
 449 After the November revolution of 1918 in Germany the Right-wing leaders of German Social-Democracy exerted every effort to save the capitalist system. 
 The Right Social-Democrats and the Independents seized the majority of seats in the Arbeiterräte which had sprung up during the revolution, and at their First All-Germany Congress, held December 16-21, 1918, in Berlin, succeeded in car-rying through a resolution on handing over power to a government representing the interests of the bourgeoisie and on convening a Constituent Assembly. 
 This actually meant the end of the Arbeiter-räte . 
 In January 1919 counter-revolutionary detachments set up by the War Minister Noske, Right Social-Democrat, brutally suppressed the revolutionary action of the Berlin proletariat. 
 On January 15, armed detachments arrested and brutally murdered the leaders of the German working class, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. 
 Having crushed the January uprising and destroyed the best leaders of the German working class, the German bourgeoisie ensured the victory of the bourgeois parties during the elections to the Con-stituent Assembly on January 19, 1919.

 451 The Polish Government’s agreement to start negotiations was mere-ly a manoeuvre to cover war preparations against the Soviet Re-public. 
 In reply to the Soviet Government’s many proposals (De-cember 22, 1919, January 28, February 2, March 6 1920), the Po-139 140 141 142 143 lish Government gave its consent only on March 2, 1920. 
 But the Polish reactionaries sabotaged the negotiations and started hostil-ities on April 25, 1920.

C. 
, R. 
C. 
P. 
[B. 
] Theses. 
 Materials for the Ninth Party Congress, Saratov, 1920)”. 
 The paragraph referred to by Lenin was included in the draft resolution with slight alterations. 
 In Gusev’s pamphlet this point is worded as follows: “All enter-prises which are not subsidiary to the chief economic task of the period should be developed to the extent that they do not interfere with the fulfilment of the main task. 
 Subsidiary enterprises should be developed as required by the main task. 
 In view of this a single economic plan should not be the sum total of production programmes worked out by individual industries and local economic coun-cils on the basis of orders received from central and local organisa-tions, but, on the contrary, such a plan should envisage the volume of production for each industry. 
 p. 
 461 Lenin refers to the meeting of the group of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions on March 15, 1920, at which Tomsky’s theses on the “Tasks of the Trade Unions” were discussed. 
 Lenin sharply criticised the theses, particularly article 7 on corporate management as the main method. 
 But the All-Russia C.

 group took up an incorrect stand, and its majority voted for Tomsky’s theses.

 After Lenin’s speech against Milyutin’s theses, the Congress by a majority vote passed a resolution which Lenin had supported.

 492 Chartis m—a mass revolutionary movement of the British workers in the thirties and forties of the nineteenth century. 
 Its organisational centre was the London Workingmen’s Association, which in 1838 drew up a petition (People’s Charter) to be presented to Par-liament, demanding universal franchise for men over 21, a secret ballot, repeal of the property qualifications for Parliamentary can-didates, annual re-election of Parliament, and so forth. 
 In 1840 the National Chartist Association was founded, which was the first mass party of workers in the labour movement. 
 On May 2, 1842 the Chartists sent a second petition to Parliament, which included demands for a shorter working day, higher wages, and the like. 
 The petition was rejected by Parliament. 
 In reply the Chartists organised a general strike. 
 In 1848 the Chartists planned a mass march to Parliament with a third petition, but the government brought in the troops to prevent it. 
 Many months passed before the petition was examined and rejected. 
 After 1848 the Chartist movement began to decline. 
 The main reason for its failure was the absence of a clear programme and tactics and the lack of consis-tently revolutionary leadership. 
 However, the Chartists had a tre-mendous influence on the political history of Britain and on the international working-class movement. 
 Lenin described Chartism as “the first broad, truly mass and politically organised proletarian “The Third International and Its Place in History”).
