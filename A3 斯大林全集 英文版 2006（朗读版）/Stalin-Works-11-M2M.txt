 389 PREFACE The Eleventh Volume of the Works of J. 
 V . 
 Stalin contains writings and speeches of the period January1928 to March 1929. 
 In this period, on the basis of the successes achieved in the socialist industrialisation of the country, theBolshevik Party worked intensively to prepare the way for the transition of the labouring masses of the peasantry from individual economy to collective-farm socialisteconomy. 
 Consistently steering a course towards the col-lectivisation of agriculture, as decided at the Fifteenth Congress of the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
), the Party worked to createall the necessary conditions for a mass influx of the peasants into the collective farms. 
 When the Party passed over to the offensive against the kulaks, the hostile Bukharin-Rykov group of Right capitulators threw off the mask and came out openly against the Party’s policy. 
 In the letter “To the Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee,” in the speeches on “The Right Danger in the C.

U. 
(B. 
) and “Bukharin’s Group and the Right Deviation in Our Party,” in the article “They Have Sunk to the Depths” and in other works, J. 
 V . 
 Stalin reveals the counter-revolutionary kulak nature of the Right devia-tion, exposes the subversive activities of the Right capi-tulators and of the Trotskyist underground anti-Soviet organisation, and points to the necessity of waginga relentless fight on two fronts, while concentrating fire on the Right deviation. 
 In the reports on The Work of the April Joint Plenum of the Central Committee and Central Control Commis-sion and Results of the July Plenum of the C.

P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) , in the talk “On the Grain Front,” the speeches on “Industrialisation and the Grain Problem” and “On the Bond between the Workers and Peasants and on State Farms,” the speech at the EighthCongress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League and the speech on “Grain Procurements and the Prospects for the Development of Agriculture,”in the article “Lenin and the Question of the Alliance with the Middle Peasant” and in other works, J. 
 V . 
 Stalin defines the principal ways and meansof solving the grain problem, building collective farms and state farms and strengthening the bond between town and country. 
 In these works he demonstrates thenecessity for a rapid rate of development of industry, as the basis for socialism and the defence of the country and sets the task of training new cadres from the ranksof the working class capable of mastering science and technology. 
 J. 
 V . 
 Stalin stresses the vital necessity for the utmost development of criticism and self-criticismas the Bolshevik method of educating cadres, as the motive force of the development of Soviet society. 
 J. 
 V . 
 Stalin’s work The National Question and Leninism published here for the first time, is devoted to further development of Marxist-Leninist theory andsubstantiation of the Bolshevik Party’s policy on the national question. 
 In this work J. 
 V . 
 Stalin advances the thesis of new, socialist nations, which have beenformed first of all in the Soviet Union, brings out the fundamental difference between bourgeois nations and socialist nations, and stresses the solidarity and via-bility of the socialist nations. 
 This volume contains J. 
 V. 
 Stalin’s well-known speech on Three Distinctive Features of the Red Army , which reveals the sources of the Red Army’s strength and might and outlines the ways and means of further strengthening it. 
 Questions of the international revolutionary move-ment and the tasks of the fraternal Communist Parties are dealt with in the report on Results of the July Plenum of the C. 
C. 
, C. 
P . 
S. 
U. 
(B.

 Stalin stresses the international significance of the Great October Socialist Revolution and of social-ist construction in the U. 
S.

 He explains that theNew Economic Policy (NEP) of the Soviet state is an inevitable phase of the socialist revolution in all countries. 
 In this volume the following fourteen works of J.

(B. 
) !(@* _MARCH !(@( GRAIN PROCUREMENTS AND THE PROSPECTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE From Statements Made in Various Parts of Siberia in January 19281 (Brief Record ) I have been sent to you here in Siberia for a short visit. 
 I have been instructed to help you to fulfil the plan for grain procurements. 
 I have also been instructedto discuss with you the prospects for the development of agriculture, the plan for developing the formation of col-lective farms and state farms in your territory. 
 You are no doubt aware that this year our country’s grain accounts show a shortage, a deficit, of more than 100,000,000 poods. 
 Because of this the Government andthe Central Committee have had to tighten up grain pro-curements in all regions and territories so as to cover this deficit in our grain accounts. 
 The deficit will haveto be met primarily by the regions and territories with good harvests, which will have not only to fulfil, but to overfulfil the plan for grain procurements. 
 You know, of course, what the effect of the deficit may be if it is not made good. 
 The effect will be that our towns and industrial centres, as well as our RedArmy, will be in grave difficulties; they will be poorly supplied and will be threatened with hunger. 
 Obviously, we cannot allow that. 
 What do you think about it? What measures are you thinking of taking in order to perform your duty to the country? I have made a tour of the districts of your territory and have had the opportunity to see for myself that your people are not seriously concernedto help our country to emerge from the grain crisis. 
 You have had a bumper harvest, one might say a record one. 
 Your grain surpluses this year are bigger than everbefore. 
 Yet the plan for grain procurements is not being fulfilled. 
 Why? What is the reason? You say that the plan for grain procurements is a heavy one, and that it cannot be fulfilled. 
 Why cannot it be fulfilled? Where did you get that idea from? Is it not a fact that your harvest this year really is a recordone? Is it not a fact that Siberia’s grain procurement plan this year is almost the same as it was last year? Why, then, do you consider that the plan cannot befulfilled? Look at the kulak farms: their barns and sheds are crammed with grain; grain is lying in the open under pent roofs for lack of storage space; thekulaks have 50,000-60,000 poods of surplus grain per farm, not counting seed, food and fodder stocks. 
 Yet you say that the grain procurement plan cannot befulfilled. 
 Why are you so pessimistic? You say that the kulaks are unwilling to deliver grain, that they are waiting for prices to rise, and preferto engage in unbridled speculation. 
 That is true. 
 But the kulaks are not simply waiting for prices to rise; they are demanding an increase in prices to three timesthose fixed by the government. 
 Do you think it permis-sible to satisfy the kulaks? The poor peasants and a considerable section of the middle peasants have alreadydelivered their grain to the state at government prices. 
 Is it permissible for the government to pay the kulaks three times as much for grain as it pays the poor and middle peasants? One has only to ask this question to realise how impermissible it would be to satisfy thekulaks’ demands. 
 If the kulaks are engaging in unbridled speculation on grain prices, why do you not prosecute them forspeculation? Don’t you know that there is a law against speculation—Article 107 of the Criminal Code of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, under which persons guilty of speculationare liable to prosecution, and their goods to confisca-tion in favour of the state? Why don’t you enforce this law against the grain speculators? Can it be that you areafraid to disturb the tranquillity of the kulak gentry?! You say that enforcement of Article 107 against the kulaks would be an emergency measure, that it wouldnot be productive of good results, that it would worsen the situation in the countryside. 
 Comrade Zagumenny is especially insistent about this. 
 Supposing it wouldbe an emergency measure—what of it? Why is it that in other territories and regions enforcement of Article 107 has yielded splendid results, has rallied the labour-ing peasantry around the Soviet Government and im-proved the situation in the countryside, while among you, in Siberia, it is held that it is bound to producebad results and worsen the situation? Why, on what grounds? You say that your prosecuting and judicial authori-ties are not prepared for such a step. 
 But why is it that in other territories and regions the prosecuting and judicial authorities were prepared for it and are actingquite effectively, yet here they are not prepared to en-force Article 107 against speculators? Who is to blame for that? Obviously, it is your Party organisations that are to blame; they are evidently working badly and are not seeing to it that the laws of our country are con-scientiously observed. 
 I have seen several dozen of your prosecuting and judicial officials. 
 Nearly all of them live in the homes of kulaks, board and lodge with them,and, of course, they are anxious to live in peace with the kulaks. 
 In reply to my question, they said that the kulaks’ homes are cleaner, and the food there is better. 
Clearly, nothing effective or useful for the Soviet state is to be expected from such prosecuting and judicial officials. 
 The only thing that is not clear is why thesegentry have not yet been cleared out and replaced by other, honest officials. 
 I propose:a) that the kulaks be ordered to deliver all their grain surpluses immediately at government prices; b) that if the kulaks refuse to obey the law they should be prosecuted under Article 107 of the Criminal Code of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
, and their grain surpluses con-fiscated in favour of the state, 25 per cent of the confis-cated grain to be distributed among the poor peasants and economically weaker middle peasants at low govern-ment prices or in the form of long-term loans. 
 As for your prosecuting and judicial officials, all who are unfit for their posts should be dismissed and replaced by honest, conscientious Soviet-minded people. 
 You will soon see that these measures yield splendid results, and you will be able not only to fulfil, but even overfulfil the plan for grain procurements. 
 But this does not exhaust the problem. 
 These meas-ures will be sufficient to correct the situation this year. 
 But there is no guarantee that the kulaks will not again sabotage the grain procurements next year. 
 More, it may be said with certainty that so long as there arekulaks, so long will there be sabotage of the grain pro-curements. 
 In order to put the grain procurements on a more or less satisfactory basis, other measures arerequired. 
 What measures exactly? I have in mind devel-oping the formation of collective farms and state farms. 
 Collective and state farms are, as you know, large-scale farms capable of employing tractors and ma-chines. 
 They produce larger marketable surpluses than the landlord or kulak farms. 
 It should be borne in mind thatour towns and our industry are growing and will contin-ue to grow from year to year. 
 That is necessary for the industrialisation of the country. 
 Consequently,the demand for grain will increase from year to year, and this means that the grain procurement plans will also increase. 
 We cannot allow our industry to bedependent on the caprice of the kulaks. 
 We must there-fore see to it that in the course of the next three or four years the collective farms and state farms, as deliverersof grain, are in a position to supply the state with at least one-third of the grain required. 
 This would rele-gate the kulaks to the background and lay the founda-tion for the more or less proper supply of grain to the workers and the Red Army. 
 But in order to achieve this, we must develop the formation of collective and statefarms to the utmost, sparing neither energy nor re-sources. 
 It can be done, and we must do it. 
 But even that is not all. 
 Our country cannot live with an eye only to today’s needs. 
 We must also give thought to the morrow, to the prospects for the develop-ment of our agriculture and, lastly, to the fate of social-ism in our country. 
 The grain problem is part of the agricultural problem, and the agricultural problem isan integral part of the problem of building socialism in our country. 
 The partial collectivisation of agricul-ture of which I have just spoken will be sufficient to keepthe working class and the Red Army more or less toler-ably supplied with grain, but it will be altogether in-sufficient for: a) providing a firm basis for a fully adequate supply of food to the whole country while ensuring the neces-sary food reserves in the hands of the state, and b) securing the victory of socialist construction in the countryside, in agriculture. 
 Today the Soviet system rests upon two heteroge-neous foundations: upon united socialised industry and upon individual small-peasant economy based on private ownership of the means of production. 
 Can the Sovietsystem persist for long on these heterogeneous founda-tions? No, it cannot. 
 Lenin says that so long as individual peasant econ-omy, which engenders capitalists and capitalism, pre-dominates in the country, the danger of a restoration of capitalism will exist. 
 Clearly, so long as this dangerexists there can be no serious talk of the victory of so-cialist construction in our country. 
 Hence, for the consolidation of the Soviet system and for the victory of socialist construction in our coun-try, the socialisation of industry alone is quite insuffi-cient. 
 What is required for that is to pass from the social-isation of industry to the socialisation of the whole of agriculture. 
 And what does that imply? It implies, firstly, that we must gradually, but un-swervingly, unite the individual peasant farms, whichproduce the smallest marketable surpluses, into collec-tive farms, kolkhozes, which produce the largest mar-ketable surpluses. 
 It implies, secondly, that all areas of our country, without exception, must be covered with collective farms (and state farms) capable of replacing not only thekulaks, but the individual peasants as well, as suppliers of grain to the state. 
 It implies, thirdly, doing away with all sources that engender capitalists and capitalism, and putting an end to the possibility of the restoration of capitalism. 
 It implies, fourthly, creating a firm basis for the systematic and abundant supply of the whole country not only with grain, but also with other foodstuffs, while ensuring the necessary reserves for the state. 
 It implies, fifthly, creating a single and firm social-ist basis for the Soviet system, for Soviet power. 
 It implies, lastly, ensuring the victory of socialist construction in our country. 
 Such are the prospects for the development of our agriculture. 
 Such is the task of victoriously building socialism in our country. 
 It is a complex and difficult task, but one that is quite possible to fulfil; for difficulties exist in order to be surmounted and vanquished. 
 We must realise that we can no longer make progress on the basis of small individual peasant economy, that what we need in agriculture is large farms capable of employing machines and producing the maximum mar-ketable surpluses. 
 There are two ways of creating large farms in agriculture: the capitalist way—through the wholesale ruin of the peasants and the organisation of big capitalist estates exploiting labour; and the so-cialist way—through the union of the small peasant farms into large collective farms, without ruining the peasants and without exploitation of labour. 
 Our Party has chosen the socialist way of creating large farms inagriculture. 
 Even before the victory of the October Revolution, and then, immediately after that victory, Lenin setthe Party the task of uniting the small peasant farms into large collective farms as the prospect for the devel-opment of our agriculture, and as the decisive meansof securing the victory of socialism in the countryside, in agriculture. 
 Lenin pointed out that: a) “The small-farming system under commodity production cannot save mankind from the poverty and oppression of the masses” (V ol. 
 XX, p. 
 1222); b) “If we continue as of old on our small farms, even as free citizens on free land, we shall still be faced with inevitable ruin” (V ol. 
 XX, p. 
 4173); c) “Only with the help of common, artel, co-operative labour can we escape from the impasse into which the imperialist war has landed us” (V ol. 
 XXIV , p. 
 537). 
 Lenin further points out: “Only if we succeed in practice in showing the peasants the advantages of common, collective, co-operative, artel cultivation of the soil, only if we succeed in helping the peasant by means of co-operative, artel farming, will the working class, which holds state power in its hands, actually prove to the peasant the correctness of its policy and actually secure the real and durable following of the vast masses of the peasantry. 
 Hence theimportance of every kind of measure to promote co-operative,artel agriculture can hardly be overestimated. 
 We have millions of individual farms in our country, scattered and dispersed in the depths of the countryside. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Only when it is proved in practice , by experience easily understood by the peasants, that the transi-tion to the co-operative, artel form of agriculture is essential andpossible, only then shall we be entitled to say that in this vastpeasant country, Russia, an important step towards socialist agri-culture has been taken”* (V ol. 
 XXIV , pp. 
 579-80). 
 Such are Lenin’s directives. 
 In pursuance of these directives, the Fifteenth Con-gress of our Party4 stated in its resolution on “Work in the Countryside”: “In the present period, the task of uniting and transforming the small individual peasant farms into large collective farmsmust be made the Party’s principal task in the countryside. 
” 5 That, comrades, is how matters stand in regard to the socialisation of agriculture in our country. 
 Our duty is to carry out these directives.

 FIRST RESULTS OF THE PROCUREMENT CAMPAIGN AND THE FURTHER TASKS OF THE PARTY To All Organisations of the C. 
P . 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) About a month and a half ago, in January 1928, we experienced a very grave crisis in regard to grain procurements. 
 Whereas by January 1927 we had managedto procure 428,000,000 poods of cereals, by January 1928 procurements of cereals scarcely totalled 300,000,000 poods. 
 Hence, by January 1928, as compared with Jan-uary 1927, we had a deficit, a shortage, of 128,000,000 poods. 
 That shortage is an approximate statistical ex-pression of the grain procurement crisis. 
 What does the grain procurement crisis imply? What is its significance? What are its probable consequences? It implies, above all, a crisis in the supply of the working class areas, high bread prices in these areas, and a fall in the real wages of the workers. 
 It implies, secondly, a crisis in the supply of the Red Army, and dissatisfaction among the Red Army men. 
 It implies, thirdly, a crisis in the supply of the flax-growing and cotton-growing areas, profiteering pricesfor grain in these areas, abandonment of the growing of flax and cotton for the growing of grain—and hence cur-tailment of cotton and flax output, leading to curtailedoutput of the corresponding branches of the textile indus-try. 
 It implies, fourthly, the absence of grain reserves in the hands of the state, both for needs at home (in the event of crop failure) and for the needs of export, whichis necessary for the import of equipment and agricul-tural machines. 
 It implies, lastly, a break-down of our entire price policy, a break-down of the policy of stabilising prices of grain products, a break-down of the policy of system-atically lowering prices of manufactured goods. 
 In order to cope with these difficulties, it was neces-sary to make up for lost time and to cover the procure-ment deficit of 128,000,000 poods. 
 And in order to coverthis deficit, it was necessary to bring into action all the levers of the Party and government, to shake our organisations out of their lethargy, to throw the bestforces of the Party, from top to bottom, on to the pro-curement front and increase the procurements at all costs, taking the utmost advantage of the short periodstill remaining before the spring thaws rendered the roads impassable. 
 It was with these objects in view that the C. 
C. 
, C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) issued its first two grain procurement directives (the first of December 14, 1927, and the second of December 24, 1927). 
 Since these directives, however,did not have the desired effect, the C. 
C. 
, C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) found it necessary to issue on January 6, 1928, a third directive, one quite exceptional both as to its tone andas to its demands. 
 This directive concluded with a threat to leaders of Party organisations in the event of their failing to secure a decisive improvement in grain pro-curements within a very short time. 
 Naturally, such a threat can be resorted to only in exceptional cases, the more so as secretaries of Party organisations work not for the sake of their jobs, but for the sake of the revo-lution. 
 Nevertheless, the C. 
C. 
 thought it proper to resortto such a step because of the above-mentioned excep-tional circumstances. 
 Of the various causes that determined the grain procurement crisis, the following should be noted. 
 Firstly. 
 The countryside is growing stronger and richer. 
 Above all, it is the kulak that has grown strong-er and richer. 
 Three years of good harvest have not been without their effect. 
 Grain surpluses this year are not less than last year, just as this year there arenot fewer, but more manufactured goods in the country than last year. 
 But the well-to-do sections of the rural population were able this year to get a living fromindustrial crops, meat products, etc. 
, and held back their grain products in order to force up prices of them. 
 True, the kulak cannot be considered the principal hold-er of grain products, but he enjoys prestige in economic matters in the countryside, he works hand in glove with the urban speculator, who pays him more for his grain,and he is able to get the middle peasant to follow him in raising grain prices, in sabotaging the Soviet price policy, because he meets with no resistance from ourprocurement organisations. 
 Secondly. 
 Our procurement organisations proved unequal to their task. 
 Abusing the system of bonusesand all the various “lawful” additions to prices, our procurement organisations, instead of curbing specula-tion, frantically competed with one another, underminedthe united front of the procurement officials, inflated grain prices and involuntarily helped the specula-tors and kulaks to sabotage the Soviet price policy, spoil the market, and reduce the volume of procurements. 
 True, if the Party had interfered, it could have put astop to these shortcomings. 
 But, intoxicated by last year’s procurement successes and absorbed by the dis-cussion, 6 it disregarded the shortcomings in the belief that everything would come right of its own accord. 
 More, a number of Party organisations adopted a per-functory attitude towards the procurements, as of noconcern of theirs, forgetting that it is primarily the Party that is answerable to the working class for short-comings in procurement, just as it is for shortcomingsin the work of all economic and co-operative organisa-tions. 
 Thirdly. 
 The line of our work in the countryside was distorted in a whole number of areas. 
 The Party’s basic slogan “rely on the poor peasant, build a stable alliance with the middle peasant, never for a momentcease fighting against the kulaks” was often applied in-correctly. 
 While our Party organisations have learned to build an alliance with the middle peasant—whichis a tremendous achievement for the Party—not every-where by far are they yet working properly with the poor peasants. 
 As to the fight against the kulaks and thekulak danger, here our Party organisations are still far from having done all they should have done. 
 This, incidently, explains why elements alien to the Partyhave of late developed both in our Party and in our other organisations, elements who fail to see that there are classes in the countryside, do not understand theprinciples of our class policy, and try to work in such a way as not to offend anybody in the countryside, to live in peace with the kulak, and generally to preserve their popularity among “all strata” of the rural popu-lation. 
 Naturally, the presence of such “Communists”in the countryside could not serve to improve our work there, to restrict the exploiting proclivities of the ku-laks, and to rally the poor peasants around the Party. 
 Further. 
 Up to January, owing to the peasants’ greater returns from non-cereal crops, animal husbandry and seasonal occupations, their effective demand wasmuch greater than last year. 
 Moreover, despite the great-er volume of manufactured goods sent to the rural areas, in terms of value there was a certain falling offin the supply of goods, that is to say, the supply lagged behind the growth of effective demand. 
 All this, coupled with such blunders in our work as belated delivery of manufactured goods to the country-side, an inadequate agricultural tax, inability to ex-tract cash surpluses from the countryside, etc. 
, broughtabout the conditions which led to the grain procurement crisis. 
 It goes without saying that the responsibility for these blunders rests primarily on the Central Commit-tee, and not only on the local Party organisations. 
 In order to put an end to the crisis, it was neces-sary, first of all, to rouse the Party organisations and make them understand that grain procurement was a matter for the whole Party. 
 It was necessary, secondly, to curb speculation and rehabilitate the market by striking at the speculators and the kulaks who engaged in speculation, by settingin motion the Soviet laws against speculation in articles of mass consumption. 
 It was necessary, thirdly, to extract the cash sur-pluses from the countryside by setting in motion the laws on self-taxation, on the peasant loan, and on il-licit distilling. 
 It was necessary, fourthly, to put our procurement organisations under the control of the Party organisa-tions, compelling them to cease competing among them-selves and to observe the Soviet price policy. 
 It was necessary, lastly, to put an end to distor-tions of the Party line in the practical work in the coun-tryside, by laying stress on the necessity of combating the kulak danger, and by making it obligatory for ourParty organisations “to develop further the offensive against the kulaks” (see the Fifteenth Party Congress resolution on “Work in the Countryside”). 
 7 We know from the Central Committee’s directives that the Party resorted precisely to these measures in its fight for increased procurements, and launched a campaign along these lines throughout the country. 
 Under different conditions and in other circumstances, the Party might have put into operation other formsof struggle as well, such as, for example, throwing tens of millions of poods of grain on to the market and thus wearing down the well-to-do sections of the rural popu-lation who were withholding their grain from the market. 
 But for that the state needed to have either sufficient grain reserves, or substantial foreign currency reservesfor importing tens of millions of poods of grain from abroad. 
 But, as we know, the state did not possess such reserves. 
 And just because such reserves were not avail-able, the Party had to resort to those emergency meas-ures which are reflected in the Central Committee’s /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR directives, which have found expression in the pro-curement campaign that has developed, and the ma-jority of which can remain in force only in the current pro-curement year. 
 The talk to the effect that we are abolishing NEP, that we are introducing the surplus-appropriation sys-tem, dekulakisation, etc. 
, is counter-revolutionary chat-ter that must be most vigorously combated. 
 NEP is the basis of our economic policy, and will remain sofor a long historical period. 
 NEP means trade and tol-erating capitalism, on condition that the state retains the right and the possibility of regulating trade in theinterest of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 Without this, the New Economic Policy would simply mean the restoration of capitalism, which is what the counter-revolutionary chatterers who are talking about the abolition of NEP refuse to understand. 
 Now we have every ground for affirming that the measures adopted and the grain procurement campaign that has developed have already been crowned with the first decisive victory for the Party. 
 The rate of procure-ment has substantially increased everywhere. 
 Twice as much was procured in January as in December. 
 In February the rate of procurement has shown a further in-crease. 
 The procurement campaign has been a test for all our organisations, Party as well as Soviet and co-operative; it has helped them to rid themselves of degen-erate elements and has brought to the fore new, revo-lutionary personnel. 
 Shortcomings in the work of the procurement organisations are being brought to light, andways of correcting them are being outlined in the course of the procurement campaign. 
 Party work in the coun-tryside is improving and acquiring a fresh spirit, and distortions of the Party line are being eliminated. 
 The influence of the kulak in the countryside is becom-ing weaker, work among the poor peasants is being livened up, Soviet public life in the countryside is being put on a firmer footing, and the prestige of the SovietGovernment among the main mass of the peasantry, including the middle peasants, is rising. 
 We are obviously emerging from the grain procure-ment crisis. 
 However, side by side with these achievements in the practical implementation of the Party’s directives,there are a number of distortions and excesses which, if not eliminated, may create new difficulties. 
 Instances of such distortions and excesses are the attempts incertain individual districts to pass to methods of direct barter, compulsory subscription to the agricultural loan, organisation of substitutes for the old interceptionsquads, and, lastly, abuse of powers of arrest, unlawful confiscation of grain surpluses, etc. 
 A definite stop must be put to all such practices. 
The Central Committee instructs all local Party and Soviet organisations, besides intensifying the ef-forts of all bodies to secure the complete fulfilment ofthe grain procurement plan, to proceed at once to pre-pare for the spring sowing campaign in such a way as to ensure an enlargement of the spring crop area. 
 The agitation carried on by individual kulak-specu-lator elements for a decrease of the sown area must be countered by a solid, concerted and organised cam-paign for an extension of the sown area by the poorer sections of the rural population and the middle peasants, particular support being rendered to the collective farms. 
 In view of the above, the C. 
C. 
, C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) rec-ommends that: 1. 
 The campaign for increasing the grain pro-curements should be continued unflaggingly, and the ful-filment of the year’s grain procurement plan should be secured at all costs. 
 2. 
 The fight against all direct and indirect raising of the contractual prices should be intensified. 
 3. 
 Competition among state and co-operative pro-curement agencies should be completely eliminated,ensuring a real united front of them against the private traders and kulaks who are speculating on a rise in prices. 
 4. 
 Pressure on the kulaks—the real holders of big marketable grain surpluses—should be continued, this pressure to be exerted exclusively on the basis ofSoviet law (in particular, by enforcing Article 107 of the Criminal Code of the R. 
S. 
F. 
S. 
R. 
 and the correspond-ing article of the Ukrainian Code against particularlymalicious elements who hold surpluses of two thousand poods of marketable grain and over); but in no circum-stances must these or similar measures be applied to themiddle peasantry. 
 5. 
 Twenty-five per cent of the grain surpluses confis-cated by law from speculators and kulak speculating ele-ments should be turned over to the poor peasants in the form of long-term loans to satisfy their need of grain for seed and, if necessary, for food. 
 6. 
 Excesses and distortions in carrying out the campaign for increasing grain procurements, which in some cases have assumed the form of applying the methods of the surplus-appropriation system, such as al-location of grain delivery quotas to the separate farms,the posting of interception squads on district bounda-ries, etc. 
, should be resolutely eliminated. 
 7. 
 When exacting from peasants repayment of debts to the state (arrears in agricultural tax, insur-ance, loans, etc. 
), while pressure should continue to be exerted on the wealthier, especially the kulak, sections ofthe rural population, rebates and preferential treatment should be accorded to the poor peasants and, where necessary, to the economically weaker middle peasants. 
 8. 
 In cases of self-taxation, higher progressive rates than those of the agricultural tax should be ap-plied to the kulaks and the well-to-do sections of therural population. 
 Exemption from self-taxation should be ensured for the poorer sections, and reduced rates for the economically weaker middle peasants and families of RedArmy men. 
 In developing the self-taxation campaign everywhere, public initiative should be stimulated and the co-operation of the poor peasants, Young CommunistLeague, women delegates and rural intellectuals exten-sively enlisted. 
 The proceeds from self-taxation should be used strictly for the purposes laid down and not al-lowed to be spent on maintaining the apparatus, the specific objects of investments, estimates of expenditure, etc. 
, being discussed and endorsed by the peasant as-semblies, and the use of the sums made subject to wide public control. 
 9. 
 Administrative methods of placing the peas-ant loan (payment in loan certificates for grain deliv-ered by peasants, compulsory allocation of loan subscription quotas to the farms, etc. 
) should be cate-gorically prohibited; attention should be focused on explaining to the peasants all the benefits the peasantloan offers them, and the influence and forces of the rural public organisations should be used to place the loan also among the wealthy sections of the rural popu-lation. 
 10. 
 There should be no relaxation of attention to satisfying the demand for manufactured goods in thegrain procurement areas. 
 While putting a stop to all direct and indirect forms of bartering grain for manu-factured goods, with regard to goods in very short supplythe privileges enjoyed by members of co-operatives may in exceptional cases be extended to peasant sellers of grain who are not members of co-operatives. 
 11. 
 While continuing verification and determined purging of Party, Soviet and co-operative organ-isations in the course of the procurement campaign,all alien and adventitious elements should be expelled from these organisations and replaced by staunch Party people or tested non-Party people.

 46, February 23, 1928 THREE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE RED ARMY Speech Delivered at a Plenum of the Moscow Soviet Held in Honour of the Tenth Anniversary of the Red Army February 25, 1928 Comrades, permit me to convey the greetings of the Central Committee of our Party to the men of our RedArmy, the men of our Red Navy, the men of our Red Air Force, and, lastly, to our potential servicemen, the armed workers of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 The Party is proud that, with the assistance of the workers and peasants, it has succeeded in creating the first Red Army in the world, which in great battlesfought for and upheld the liberty of the workers and peasants. 
 The Party is proud that the Red Army has acquitted itself with honour in travelling the hard route of fierce battles against internal and external enemies of the working class and peasantry of our country, that ithas succeeded in taking shape as a mighty militant rev-olutionary force, to the terror of the enemies of the work-ing class and the joy of all the oppressed and enslaved. 
 The Party is proud that the Red Army, having trav-elled the long route of the liberation of the workers and peasants from the yoke of the landlords and capitalists,has at last won the right to celebrate its jubilee, marking the completion of the tenth year since its birth. 
 Comrades, wherein lies the strength, what is the source of the strength of our Red Army? What are the features which radically distinguish our Red Army from all armies that have ever existed in the world? What are the distinctive features which constitute the source of the strength and might of our Red Army? The first fundamental distinctive feature of our Red Army is that it is the army of the liberated workers andpeasants, it is the army of the October Revolution, the army of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 All armies that have ever existed under capitalism, no matter what their composition, have been armies for the furtherance of the power of capital. 
 They were, and are, armies of capitalist rule. 
 The bourgeois of all coun-tries lie when they say that the army is politically neu-tral. 
 That is not true. 
 In bourgeois countries, the army is deprived of political rights, it is not allowed into thepolitical arena. 
 That is true. 
 But that by no means im-plies that it is politically neutral. 
 On the contrary, al-ways and everywhere, in all capitalist countries, the ar-my was, and is, drawn into the political struggle as an instrument for the suppression of the working people. 
 Is it not true that the army in those countries suppressesthe workers and serves as a buttress of the masters? In contrast to such armies, our Red Army is dis-tinguished by the fact that it is an instrument for thefurtherance of the power of the workers and peasants, an instrument for the furtherance of the dictatorship of the proletariat, an instrument for the liberation ofthe workers and peasants from the yoke of the land-lords and capitalists. 
 Our army is an army of liberation of the working people. 
 Have you considered the fact, comrades, that in the old days the people feared the army, as indeed they fear it now in the capitalist countries; that between the people and the army is a barrier separating the onefrom the other? And how is it with us? With us, on the contrary, people and army constitute a single whole, a single family. 
 Nowhere in the world is there such an at-titude of love and solicitude on the part of the people for the army as in our country. 
 In our country the army is loved and respected, it is the object of general so-licitude. 
 Why? Because for the first time in the history of the world the workers and peasants have created their own army, which serves not the masters, but the formerslaves, the now emancipated workers and peasants. 
 There you have a source of the strength of our Red Army. 
 And what does the people’s love for their army mean? It means that such an army will have the firmest of rears, that such an army is invincible. 
 What is an army without a firm rear? Nothing at all. 
 The biggest armies, the best-equipped armies collapsed and fell to pieces when they did not have a firm rear,when they did not have the support and sympathy of the rear, of the labouring population. 
 Ours is the only army in the world that has the sympathy and supportof the workers and peasants. 
 Therein lies its strength, therein lies its might. 
 That, above all, is what distinguishes our Red Army from all other armies that ever existed or exist to-day. 
 The desire of the Party, its task, is to see to it that this distinctive feature of the Red Army, its closeness to and fraternal connection with the workersand peasants, is preserved and made permanent. 
 A second distinctive feature of our Red Army is that it is an army of brotherhood among the nationsof our country, an army of liberation of the oppressed nations of our country, an army of defence of the liberty and independence of the nations of our country. 
 In the old days, armies were usually trained in the spirit of dominant-nation chauvinism, in the spirit of con-quest, in the belief of the need to subjugate weaker na-tions. 
 That, indeed, explains why armies of the old type, capitalist armies, were at the same time armies of na-tional, colonial oppression. 
 Therein lay one of the fun-damental weaknesses of the old armies. 
 Our army rad-ically differs from the armies of colonial oppression. 
 Its whole nature, its whole structure, is based on strengthen-ing the ties of friendship among the nations of our coun-try, on the idea of liberating the oppressed peoples, on the idea of defending the liberty and independenceof the socialist republics that go to make up the Soviet Union. 
 That is a second and fundamental source of the strength and might of our Red Army. 
 Therein lies the pledge that at a critical moment our army will have the fullest support of the vast masses of all the nations andnationalities inhabiting our boundless land. 
 The desire of the Party, its task, is to see to it that this distinctive feature of our Red Army is likewisepreserved and made permanent. 
 And, lastly, a third distinctive feature of the Red Army. 
 It is that the spirit of internationalism is trained and fostered in our army, that the spirit of internation-alism imbues our Red Army through and through. 
 In the capitalist countries, armies are usually trained to hate the peoples of other countries, to hate otherstates, to hate the workers and peasants of other coun-tries. 
 Why is this done? In order to turn the army into an obedient herd in the event of armed clashes betweenstates, between powers, between countries. 
 That is a source of weakness of all capitalist armies. 
 Our army is built on entirely different principles. 
 The strength of our Red Army lies in the fact that from the day of its birth it has been trained in a spirit of inter-nationalism, that it has been trained to respect the peo-ples of other countries, to love and respect the workers of all countries, to preserve and promote peace among countries. 
 And precisely because our army is trainedin the spirit of internationalism, trained to understand that the interests of the workers of all countries are one, precisely for this reason our army is an army of the work-ers of all countries. 
 And that this is a source of our army’s strength and might, the bourgeois of all countries will learn if theyshould venture to attack our country, for they will then see that our Red Army, trained as it is in the spirit of internationalism, has countless friends and allies in allparts of the world, from Shanghai to New York and from London to Calcutta. 
 That, comrades, is a third and fundamental distinc-tive feature which imbues the spirit of our army and con-stitutes a source of its strength and might. 
 The desire of the Party, its task, is to see to it that this distinctive feature of our army is likewise pre-served and made permanent. 
 It is to these three distinctive features that our army owes its strength and might. 
 This, too, explains the fact that our army knows where it is heading for, because it consists not of tin soldiers, but of enlightened people who understand where to head for and what to fight for. 
 But an army that knows what it is fighting for is invincible, comrades. 
 That is why our Red Army has every ground for being the best army in the world. 
 Long live our Red Army! Long live its soldiers!Long live its leaders! Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat which created the Red Army, gave it victory and crownedit with glory! ( Stormy and prolonged applause .

8 that has just concluded has one feature which distin-guishes it from the series of plenary meetings held in the past two years. 
 This feature is that it was a plenumof a purely business-like character, a plenum where there were no inner-Party conflicts, a plenum where there were no inner-Party dissensions. 
 Its agenda consisted of the most burning questions of the day: the grain procurements, the Shakhty affair, 9 and, lastly, the plan of work of the Political Bureau and plenum of the Central Committee. 
 These, as you see, are quite serious questions. 
 Nevertheless, the debates at the plenum were of a purely business-like character,and the resolutions were adopted unanimously. 
 The reason is that there was no opposition at the plenum. 
 The reason is that the questions were approachedin a strictly business-like manner, without faction-al attacks, without factional demagogy. 
 The reason is that only after the Fifteenth Congress, only after theliquidation of the opposition, did it become possible * Several paragraphs of this report which at the time were not published in the press are here restored. 
— Ed. 
 for the Party to tackle practical problems seriously and thoroughly. 
 That is the good aspect and, if you like, the ines-timable advantage of that phase of development which we have entered since the Fifteenth Congress of our Par-ty, since the liquidation of the opposition. 
 I SELF-CRITICISM A characteristic feature of the work of this plenum, of its debates and its resolutions, is that from beginning to end, its key-note was the sternest self-criticism. 
 More, there was not a single question, not a single speech, atthe plenum which was not accompanied by criticism of shortcomings in our work, by self-criticism of our or-ganisations. 
 Criticism of our shortcomings, honest andBolshevik self-criticism of Party, Soviet and economic organisations—that was the general tone of the plenum. 
 I know that there are people in the ranks of the Partywho have no fondness for criticism in general, and for self-criticism in particular. 
 Those people, whom I might call “skin-deep” Communists ( laughter ), every now and then grumble and shrug their shoulders at self-criti-cism, as much as to say: Again this accursed self-criti-cism, again this raking out of our shortcomings—can’t we be allowed to live in peace? Obviously, those “skin-deep” Communists are complete strangers to the spirit of our Party, to the spirit of Bolshevism. 
Well, in view of the existence of such sentiments among those people who greet self-criticism with anything but enthusiasm, it is permissible to ask: Do we need self-criticism; where does it derive from, and what is its value? I think, comrades, that self-criticism is as neces-sary to us as air or water. 
 I think that without it, without self-criticism, our Party could not make any headway, could not disclose our ulcers, could not eliminate ourshortcomings. 
 And shortcomings we have in plenty. 
 That must be admitted frankly and honestly. 
 The slogan of self-criticism cannot be regarded as a new one. 
 It lies at the very foundation of the Bolshe-vik Party. 
 It lies at the foundation of the regime of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 Since our countryis a country with a dictatorship of the proletariat, and since the dictatorship is directed by one party, the Communist Party, which does not, and cannot, sharepower with other parties, is it not clear that, if we want to make headway, we ourselves must disclose and cor-rect our errors—is it not clear that there is no one else todisclose and correct them for us? Is it not clear, com-rades, that self-criticism must be one of the most impor-tant motive forces of our development? The slogan of self-criticism has developed especially powerfully since the Fifteenth Congress of our Party. 
 Why? Because after the Fifteenth Congress, which putan end to the opposition, a new situation arose in the Par-ty, one that we have to reckon with. 
 In what does the novelty of this situation consist? In the fact that now we have no opposition, or next to none; in the fact that, because of the easy victory over the opposition—a victory which in itself is a mostimportant gain for the Party—there may be a danger of the Party resting on its laurels, beginning to take things easy and closing its eyes to the shortcomings in our work. 
 The easy victory over the opposition is a most important gain for our Party. 
 But concealed within it is a certain drawback, which is that the Party may be a prey to self-satisfaction, to self-admiration, and begin to rest onits laurels. 
 And what does resting on our laurels mean? It means putting an end to our forward movement. 
 And in order that this may not occur, we need self-criticism—not that malevolent and actually counter-revolutionary criticism which the opposition indulged in—but honest, frank, Bolshevik self-criticism. 
 The Fifteenth Congress of our Party was alive to this, and it issued the slogan of self-criticism. 
 Since then the tide of self-criticism has been mounting, andit laid its imprint also on the work of the April plenum of the C. 
C. 
 and C.

 It would be strange to fear that our enemies, our internal and external enemies, might exploit the criti-cism of our shortcomings and raise the shout: Oho! All is not well with those Bolsheviks! It would be strange if we Bolsheviks were to fear that. 
 The strength of Bolshevism lies precisely in the fact that it is not afraid to admit its mistakes. 
 Let the Party, let the Bolshe-viks, let all the upright workers and labouring elements in our country bring to light the shortcomings in our work, the shortcomings in our constructive effort,and let them indicate ways of eliminating our shortcom-ings, so that there may be no stagnation, vegetation, decay in our work and our construction, so that allour work and all our constructive measures may improve from day to day and go from success to success. 
 That is the chief thing just now. 
 As for our enemies, let them rant about our shortcomings—such trifles cannot and should not disconcert Bolsheviks. 
 Lastly, there is-yet another circumstance that im-pels us to self-criticism. 
 I am referring to the question of the masses and the leaders. 
 A peculiar sort of relationhas lately begun to arise between the leaders and the masses. 
 On the one hand there was formed, there came into being historically, a group of leaders among uswhose prestige is rising and rising, and who are becoming almost unapproachable for the masses. 
 On the other hand the working-class masses in the first place,and the mass of the working people in general are ris-ing extremely slowly, are beginning to look up at the leaders from below with blinking eyes, and not infrequent-ly are afraid to criticise them. 
 Of course, the fact that we have a group of leaders who have risen excessively high and enjoy great pres-tige is in itself a great achievement for our Party. 
 Ob-viously, the direction of a big country would be unthink-able without such an authoritative group of leaders. 
But the fact that as these leaders rise they get further away from the masses, and the masses begin to look up at them from below and do not venture to criticise them,cannot but give rise to a certain danger of the leaders losing contact with the masses and the masses getting out of touch with the leaders. 
 This danger may result in the leaders becoming con-ceited and regarding themselves as infallible. 
 And what good can be expected when the top leaders become self-conceited and begin to look down on the masses? Clear-ly, nothing can come of this but the ruin of the Party. 
 But what we want is not to ruin the Party, but to move forward and improve our work. 
 And precisely in order that we may move forward and improve the relationsbetween the masses and the leaders, we must keep the valve of self-criticism open all the time, we must make it possible for Soviet people to “go for” their leaders,to criticise their mistakes, so that the leaders may not grow conceited, and the masses may not get out of touch with the leaders. 
 The question of the masses and the leaders is some-times identified with the question of promotion. 
 That is wrong, comrades. 
 It is not a question of bringingnew leaders to the fore, although this deserves the Party’s most serious attention. 
 It is a question of pre-serving the leaders who have already come to the foreand possess the greatest prestige by organising perma-nent and indissoluble contact between them and the masses. 
 It is a question of organising, along the linesof self-criticism and criticism of our shortcomings, the broad public opinion of the Party, the broad public opinion of the working class, as an instrument of keenand vigilant moral control, to which the most authori-tative leaders must lend an attentive ear if they want to retain the confidence of the Party and the confidenceof the working class. 
 From this standpoint, the value of the press, of our Party and Soviet press, is truly inestimable. 
 Fromthis standpoint, we cannot but welcome the initiative shown by Pravda in publishing the Bulletin of the Work-ers’ and Peasants ’ Inspection , 10 which conducts system-atic criticism of shortcomings in our work. 
 Only we must see to it that the criticism is serious and penetrating, and does not just skate on the surface. 
 From this stand-point, too, we have to welcome the initiative shown by Komsomolskaya Pravda11 in vigorously and spiritedly attacking shortcomings in our work. 
 Critics are sometimes abused because of imperfec-tions in their criticism, because their criticism is notalways 100 per cent correct. 
 The demand is often made that criticism should be correct on all accounts, and if it is not correct on every point, they begin to decry anddisparage it. 
 That is wrong, comrades. 
 It is a dangerous miscon-ception. 
 Only try to put forward such a demand, and youwill gag hundreds and thousands of workers, worker correspondents and village correspondents who desire to correct our shortcomings but who sometimes areunable to formulate their ideas correctly. 
 We would get not self-criticism, but the silence of the tomb. 
 You must know that workers are sometimes afraid to tell the truth about shortcomings in our work. 
 They are afraid not only because they might get into “hot water” for it, but also because they might be made intoa “laughing-stock” on account of their imperfect criti-cism. 
 How can you expect an ordinary worker or an ordinary peasant, with his own painful experience ofshortcomings in our work and in our planning, to frame his criticism according to all the rules of the art? If you demand that their criticism should be 100 per cent cor-rect, you will be killing all possibility of criticism from below, all possibility of self-criticism. 
 That is why I think that if criticism is even only 5 or 10 per cent true,such criticism should be welcomed, should be listened to attentively, and the sound core in it taken into ac-count. 
 Otherwise, I repeat, you would be gagging all those hundreds and thousands of people who are devot-ed to the cause of the Soviets, who are not yet skilledenough in the art of criticism, but through whose lips speaks truth itself. 
 Precisely in order to develop self-criticism and not extinguish it, we must listen attentively to all criti-cism coming from Soviet people, even if sometimes it may not be correct to the full and in all details. 
 Onlythen can the masses have the assurance that they will not get into “hot water” if their criticism is not per-fect, that they will not be made a “laughing-stock” ifthere should be errors in their criticism. 
 Only then can self-criticism acquire a truly mass character and meet with a truly mass response. 
 It goes without saying that what we have in mind is not just “any sort” of criticism. 
 Criticism by a counter-revolutionary is also criticism. 
 But its object is todiscredit the Soviet regime, to undermine our indus-try, to disrupt our Party work. 
 Obviously, it is not such criticism we have in mind. 
 It is not of such criti-cism I am speaking, but of criticism that comes from Soviet people, and which has the aim of improving the organs of Soviet rule, of improving our industry, ofimproving our Party and trade-union work. 
 We need crit-icism in order to strengthen the Soviet regime, not to weaken it. 
 And it is precisely with a view to strengthen-ing and improving our work that the Party proclaims the slogan of criticism and self-criticism. 
 What do we expect primarily from the slogan of self-criticism, what results can it yield if it is carried out properly and honestly? It should yield at least two results. 
 It should, in the first place, sharpen the vigi-lance of the working class, make it pay more atten-tion to our shortcomings, facilitate their correction,and render impossible any kind of “surprises” in our constructive work. 
 It should, in the second place, improve the political culture of the working class, de-velop in it the feeling that it is the master of the country, and facilitate the training of the working class in the work of administering the country. 
 Have you considered the fact that not only the Shakh-ty affair, but also the procurement crisis of January 1928 came as a “surprise” to many of us? The Shakhtyaffair was particularly noteworthy in this respect. 
 This counter-revolutionary group of bourgeois experts car-ried on their work for five years, receiving instruc-tions from the anti-Soviet organisations of internation-al capital. 
 For five years our organisations were writ-ing and circulating all sorts of resolutions and deci-sions. 
 Our coal industry, of course, was making headway all the same, because our Soviet economic system is so virile and powerful that it got the upper hand in spiteof our blockheadedness and our blunders, and in spite of the subversive activities of the experts. 
 For five years this counter-revolutionary group of experts was en-gaged in sabotaging our industry, causing boiler explo-sions, wrecking turbines, and so on. 
 And all this time we were oblivious to everything. 
 Then “suddenly,” likea bolt from the blue, came the Shakhty affair. 
 Is this normal, comrades? I think it is very far from normal. 
 To stand at the helm and peer ahead, yetsee nothing until circumstances bring us face to face with some calamity—that is not leadership. 
 That is not the way Bolshevism understands leadership. 
 In order to lead, one must foresee. 
 And foreseeing is not always easy, comrades. 
 It is one thing when a dozen or so leading comrades are on the watch for and detect shortcomings in our work, while the working masses are unwilling or unable ei-ther to watch for or to detect shortcomings. 
 Here all the chances are that you will be sure to overlook some-thing, will not detect everything. 
 It is another thingwhen, together with the dozen or so leading comrades, hundreds of thousands and millions of workers are on the watch to detect shortcomings in our work, disclos-ing our errors, throwing themselves into the general work of construction and indicating ways of improving it. 
 Here there is a greater guarantee that there will beno surprises, that objectionable features will be noted promptly and prompt measures taken to eliminate them. 
 We must see to it that the vigilance of the working class is not damped down, but stimulated, that hundreds of thousands and millions of workers are drawn intothe general work of socialist construction, that hundreds of thousands and millions of workers and peasants, and not merely a dozen leaders, keep vigilant watch over theprogress of our construction work, notice our errors and bring them into the light of day. 
 Only then shall we have no “surprises. 
” But to bring this about, we must devel-op criticism of our shortcomings from below, we must make criticism the affair of the masses, we must assim-ilate and carry out the slogan of self-criticism. 
 Lastly, as regards promoting the cultural powers of the working class, developing in it the faculty of administering the country in connection with the car-rying out of the slogan of self-criticism. 
 Lenin said: “The chief thing we lack is culture, ability to administer. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Economically and politically, N E P fully ensures us the pos-sibility of laying the foundation of a socialist economy. 
 It is ‘only’a matter of the cultural forces of the proletariat and of itsvanguard. 
” 12 What does this mean? It means that one of the main tasks of our constructive work is to develop in the work-ing class the faculty and ability to administer the coun-try, to administer economy, to administer industry. 
 Can we develop this faculty and ability in the work-ing class without giving full play to the powers and capacities of the workers, the powers and capaci-ties of the finest elements of the working class, for crit-icising our errors, for detecting our shortcomings and for advancing our work? Obviously, we cannot. 
 And what is required in order to give full play to the powers and capacities of the working class and the working people generally, and to enable them to acquirethe faculty of administering the country? It requires, above all, honest and Bolshevik observance of the slogan of self-criticism, honest and Bolshevik observance of theslogan of criticism from below of shortcomings and errors in our work. 
 If the workers take advantage of the opportunity to criticise shortcomings in our workfrankly and bluntly, to improve and advance our work, what does that mean? It means that the workers are be-coming active participants in the work of directing thecountry, economy, industry. 
 And this cannot but en-hance in the workers the feeling that they are the mas-ters of the country, cannot but enhance their activity, their vigilance, their culture. 
 This question of the cultural powers of the working class is a decisive one. 
 Why? Because, of all the ruling classes that have hitherto existed, the working class, as a ruling class, occupies a somewhat special andnot altogether favourable position in history. 
 All ruling classes until now—the slave-owners, the landlords, the capitalists—were also wealthy classes. 
 They were in aposition to train in their sons the knowledge and facul-ties needed for government. 
 The working class differs from them, among other things, in that it is not a wealthyclass, that it was not able formerly to train in its sons the knowledge and faculty of government, and has become able to do so only now, after coming to power. 
 That, incidently, is the reason why the question of a cultural revolution is so acute with us. 
 True, in the ten years of its rule the working class of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 hasaccomplished far more in this respect than the landlords and capitalists did in hundreds of years. 
 But the in-ternational and internal situation is such that the re-sults achieved are far from sufficient. 
 Therefore, every means capable of promoting the development of the cultural powers of the working class, every means capa-ble of facilitating the development in the working class of the faculty and ability to administer the country and industry—every such means must be utilised by us tothe full. 
 But it follows from what has been said that the slo-gan of self-criticism is one of the most important meansof developing the cultural powers of the proletariat, of developing the faculty of government in the working class. 
 From this follows yet another reason why the car-rying out of the slogan of self-criticism is a vital task for us. 
 Such, in general, are the reasons which make the slogan of self-criticism imperative for us as a slogan of the day. 
 It is not surprising, therefore, that the key-note of the April plenum of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
 was self-criti-cism. 
 Let us pass now to the question of grain procurements. 
 II THE QUESTION OF GRAIN PROCUREMENTS First of all, a few words about the nature of the grain procurement crisis that developed here in January of this year. 
 The essence of the matter is that in October of last year our procurements began to decline, reacheda very low point in December, and by January of this year we had a deficit of 130,000,000 poods of grain. 
 This year’s harvest was, perhaps, no worse than lastyear’s; it may have been a little less. 
 The carry-over from previous harvests was bigger than it was last year, and it was generally considered that the marketablesurplus of grain in our country this year was not smaller, but larger than in the previous year. 
 It was with this consideration in mind that the pro-curement plan for the year was fixed at slightly above last year’s plan. 
 But in spite of this, the procurements declined, and by January 1928 we had a deficit of130,000,000 poods. 
 It was an “odd” situation: there was plenty of grain in the country, yet the procurements were falling and creating the threat of hunger in the towns and in the Red Army. 
 How is this “oddity” to be explained? Was it not due to some chance factor? The explanation many are inclined to give is that we had been caught napping, had been too busy with the opposition and had let ourattention slip. 
 That we really had been caught napping is, of course, true. 
 But to put it all down to an oversight would be the grossest error. 
 Still less can theprocurement crisis be attributed to some chance factor. 
 Such things do not happen by chance. 
 That would be too cheap an explanation. 
 What, then, were the factors that led up to the pro-curement crisis? I think there were at least three such factors. 
Firstly . 
 The difficulties of our socialist construc-tion in the conditions of our international and internal situation. 
 I am referring primarily to the difficultiesof developing urban industry. 
 It is necessary to pour goods of every kind into the countryside in order to be able to draw out of it the maximum quantity of agri-cultural produce. 
 This requires a faster rate of develop-ment of our industry than is the case now. 
 But in order to develop industry more swiftly, we need a faster rateof socialist accumulation. 
 And to attain such a rate of accumulation is not so easy, comrades. 
 The result is a shortage of goods in the countryside. 
 I am referring, further, to the difficulties of our constructive work in the countryside. 
 Agriculture is developing slowly, comrades. 
 It should be develop-ing with gigantic strides, grain should become cheaper and harvests bigger, fertilisers should be applied to the utmost and mechanised production of grain should be developed at high speed. 
 But that is not the case, comrades, and will not come about quickly. 
 Why? Because our agriculture is a small-peasant economy, which does not readily lend itself to substantial im-provement. 
 Statistics tell us that before the war there were about 16,000,000 individual peasant farms in our country. 
 Now we have about 25,000,000 individualpeasant farms. 
 This means that ours is essentially a land of small-peasant economy. 
 And what is small-peasant economy? It is the most insecure, the most prim-itive, the most underdeveloped form of economy, pro-ducing the smallest marketable surpluses. 
 That is the whole crux of the matter, comrades. 
 Fertilisers, machines,scientific agriculture and other improvements—these are things which can be effectively applied on large farms, but which are inapplicable or practically inap-plicable in small-peasant economy. 
 That is the weakness of small-scale economy, and that is why it cannot com-pete with the large kulak farms. 
 Have we any large farms at all in the coun-tryside, employing machines, fertilisers, scientific ag-riculture and so on? Yes, we have. 
 Firstly, there arethe collective farms and state farms. 
 But we have few of them, comrades. 
 Secondly, there are the large kulak (capitalist) farms. 
 Such farms are by no means few inour country, and they are still a big factor in agricul-ture. 
 Can we adopt the course of encouraging privately owned, large capitalist farms in the countryside? Obvious-ly, we cannot. 
 It follows then that we must do our ut-most to develop in the countryside large farms of the type of the collective farms and state farms and try to convert them into grain factories for the coun-try organised on a modern scientific basis. 
 That, in fact, explains why the Fifteenth Congress of our Party issued the slogan of the maximum development in formingcollective and state farms. 
 It would be a mistake to think that the collective farms must only be formed from the poorer strata of thepeasantry. 
 That would be wrong, comrades. 
 Our collec-tive farms must comprise both poor and middle peasants, and embrace not only individual groups or clusters, butentire villages. 
 The middle peasant must be given a prospect, he must be shown that he can develop his hus-bandry best and most rapidly through the collectivefarm. 
 Since the middle peasant cannot rise into the kulak group, and it would be unwise for him to sink, he must be given the prospect of being able to im-prove his husbandry through the formation of collective farms. 
 But our collective farms and state farms are still all too few, scandalously few. 
 Hence the difficulties of our constructive work in the countryside. 
 Hence our inadequate grain output. 
 Secondly . 
 It follows from this that the difficulties of our constructive work in town and country are a basis on which a procurement crisis can develop. 
 Butthis does not mean that a procurement crisis was bound to develop precisely this year. 
 We know that these dif-ficulties existed not only this year, but also last year. 
Why, then, did a procurement crisis develop precisely this year? What is the secret? The secret is that this year the kulak was able to take advantage of these difficulties to force up grain prices, launch an attack on the Soviet price policy and thusslow up our procurement operations. 
 And he was able to take advantage of these difficulties for at least two reasons: firstly, because three years of good harvests had not been without their effect. 
 The kulak grew strong in that period, grain stocks in the countryside in general,and among the kulaks in particular, accumulated during that time, and it became possible for the kulak to at-tempt to dictate prices; secondly, because the kulak had support from the urban speculators, who speculate on a rise of grain prices and thus force up prices. 
 This does not mean, of course, that the kulak is the principal holder of grain. 
 By and large, it is the middle peasant who holds most of the grain. 
 But the kulakhas a certain economic prestige in the countryside, and in the matter of prices he is sometimes able to get the middle peasant to follow his lead. 
 The kulak ele-ments in the countryside are thus in a position to take advantage of the difficulties of our constructive work for forcing up grain prices for purposes of specula-tion. 
 But what is the consequence of forcing up grain prices by, say, 40-50 per cent, as the kulak speculat-ing elements did? The first consequence is to undermine the real wages of the workers. 
 Let us suppose that we had raised workers’ wages at the time. 
 But in that casewe should have had to raise prices of manufactured goods, and that would have hit at the living standards both of the working class and of the poor and middle peasants. 
 And what would have been the effect of this? The effect would undoubtedly have been directly toundermine our whole economic policy. 
 But that is not all. 
 Let us suppose that we had raised grain prices 40-50 per cent in January or in the springof this year, just before the preparations for the sowing. 
 What would have been the result? We should have dis-organised the raw materials base of our industry. 
 Thecotton-growers would have abandoned the growing of cotton and started growing grain, as a more profitable business. 
 The flax-growers would have abandoned flaxand also started growing grain. 
 The beet-growers would have done the same. 
 And so on and so forth. 
 In short, we should have undermined the raw materials base of our in-dustry because of the profiteering appetites of the capi-talist elements in the countryside. 
 But that is not all either. 
 If we had forced up grain prices this spring, say, we should certainly have brought misery on the poor peasant, who in the spring buys grain for food as well as for sowing his fields. 
 The poorpeasants and the lower-middle peasants would have had every right to say to us: “You have deceived us, because last autumn we sold grain to you at low prices,and now you are compelling us to buy grain at high prices. 
 Whom are you protecting, gentlemen of the So-viets, the poor peasants or the kulaks?” That is why the Party had to retaliate to the blow of the kulak speculators, aimed at forcing up grain prices, with a counter-blow that would knock out of the kulaks and speculators all inclination to menace the working class and our Red Army with hunger. 
 Thirdly . 
 It is unquestionable that the capitalist elements in the countryside could not have taken advan-tage of the difficulties of our constructive work to thedegree they actually did, and the procurement crisis would not have assumed such a menacing character, if they had not been assisted in this matter by one othercircumstance. 
 What is that circumstance? It is the slackness of our procurement bodies, the absence of a united front between them, their compe-tition with one another, and their reluctance to wage a determined struggle against speculating on higher grain prices. 
 It is, lastly, the inertia of our Party organisations in the grain procurement areas, their reluctance to in-tervene as they should have done in the grain pro-curement campaign, their reluctance to intervene and put an end to the general slackness on the procurement front. 
 Intoxicated by the successes of last year’s procure-ment campaign, and believing that this year the pro-curements would come in automatically, our procurementand Party organisations left it all to the “will of God,” and left a clear field to the kulak speculating elements. 
 And that was just what the kulaks were waiting for. 
It is scarcely to be doubted that, had it not been for this circumstance, the procurement crisis could not have assumed such a menacing character. 
 It should not be forgotten that we, that is to say our organisations, both procurement and other, control nearly 80 per cent of the supply of manufactured goodsto the countryside, and nearly 90 per cent of all the pro-curements there. 
 It need scarcely be said that this cir-cumstance makes it possible for us to dictate to the ku-lak in the countryside, provided that our organisations know how to utilise this favourable position. 
 But we,instead of utilising this favourable position, allowed everything to go on automatically and thereby facili-tated—against our own will, of course—the fight of thecapitalist elements of the countryside against the Soviet Government. 
 Such, comrades, were the conditions which deter-mined the procurement crisis at the end of last year. 
 You see, therefore, that the procurement crisis cannot be considered a matter of chance. 
 You see that the procurement crisis is the expression of the first serious action, under the conditions of NEP, undertaken by the capitalist elements of the countrysideagainst the Soviet Government in connection with one of the most important questions of our constructive work, that of grain procurements. 
 That, comrades, is the class background of the grain procurement crisis. 
 You know that, in order to end the procurement crisis and curb the kulaks’ appetite for speculation, the Party and the Soviet Government were obliged to adopt a number of practical measures. 
 Quite a lot has been saidabout these measures in our press. 
 They have been dealt with in fairly great detail in the resolution of the joint plenum of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
 Hence I think that thereis no need to repeat that here. 
 I only want to say something about certain emer-gency measures which were taken because of the emer-gency circumstances, and which, of course, will lapse when these emergency circumstances cease to exist. 
 I am referring to the enforcement of Article 107 of the law against speculation. 
 This article was adopted by the Central Executive Committee in 1926. 
 It was not appliedlast year. 
 Why? Because the grain procurements pro-ceeded, as it is said, normally, and there were no grounds for applying this article. 
 It was called to mindonly this year, at the beginning of 1928. 
 And it was re-called because we had a number of emergency circum-stances which resulted from the speculating machinationsof the kulaks and which held out the threat of hunger. 
 It is clear that if there are no emergency circumstances in the next procurement year and the procurementsproceed normally, Article 107 will not be applied. 
 And, on the contrary, if emergency circumstances arise and the capitalist elements start their “tricks” again,Article 107 will again appear on the scene. 
 It would be stupid on these grounds to say that NEP is being “abolished,” that there is a “reversion” to thesurplus-appropriation system, and so on. 
 Only enemies of the Soviet regime can now think of abolishing NEP. 
 Nobody benefits more from the New Economic Policynow than the Soviet Government. 
 But there are people who think that NEP means not intensifying the struggle against capitalist elements, including the kulaks, witha view to overcoming them, but ceasing the struggle against the kulaks and other capitalist elements. 
 It need scarcely be said that such people have nothing incommon with Leninism, for there is not, and cannot be, any place for them in our Party. 
 The results of the measures taken by the Party and the Soviet Government to put an end to the food crisis are also known to you. 
 Briefly, they are as follows. 
 Firstly, we made up for lost time and procured grain at a tempo which equalled, and in places surpassed, that of last year. 
 You know that in the three monthsJanuary-March we succeeded in procuring more than 270,000,000 poods of grain. 
 That, of course, is not all we need. 
 We shall still have to procure upwards of100,000,000 poods. 
 Nevertheless, it constituted that necessary achievement which enabled us to put an end to the procurement crisis. 
 We are now fully justified insaying that the Party and the Soviet Government have scored a signal victory on this front. 
 Secondly, we have put our procurement and Party organisations in the localities on a sound, or more or less sound, footing, having tested their combat readiness in practice and purged them of blatantly corrupt ele-ments who refuse to recognise the existence of classes in the countryside and are reluctant to “quarrel” with the kulaks. 
 Thirdly, we have improved our work in the coun-tryside, we have brought the poor peasants closer to us and won the allegiance of the overwhelming majority of themiddle peasants, we have isolated the kulaks and have somewhat offended the well-to-do top stratum of the middle peasants. 
 In doing so, we have put into effectour old Bolshevik slogan, proclaimed by Lenin as far back as the Eighth Congress of our Party 13: Rely on the poor peasant, build a stable alliance with the middlepeasant, never for a moment cease fighting against the kulaks. 
 I know that some comrades do not accept this slo-gan very willingly. 
 It would be strange to think that now, when the dictatorship of the proletariat is firmly established, the alliance of the workers and the peasants means an alliance of the workers with the entire peas-antry, including the kulaks. 
 No, comrades, such an alliancewe do not advocate, and cannot advocate. 
 Under the dic-tatorship of the proletariat, when the power of the working class is firmly established, the alliance of the working classwith the peasantry means reliance on the poor peasants, alliance with the middle peasants, and a fight against the kulaks. 
 Whoever thinks that under our conditionsalliance with the peasantry means alliance with the kulaks has nothing in common with Leninism. 
 Who-ever thinks of conducting a policy in the countrysidethat will please everyone, rich and poor alike, is not a Marxist, but a fool, because such a policy does not exist in nature, comrades. 
 ( Laughter and applause . 
) Our pol-icy is a class policy. 
 Such, in the main, are the results of the measures we took to increase the grain procurements. 
 Undoubtedly, in the practical work of carrying out these measures there were a number of excesses and distortions of the Party line. 
 A number of cases of distor-tion of our policy which, because of our blockheadedness, hit primarily at the poor and middle peasant—cases of incorrect application of Article 107, etc. 
—are familiarto all. 
 We punish, and shall punish, people guilty of such distortions with the utmost severity. 
 But it would be strange, because of these distortions, not to see thebeneficial and truly valuable results of the Party’s mea-ures, without which we could not have emerged from the procurement crisis. 
 To do so would be closing one’seyes to the chief thing and giving prominence to that which is minor and incidental. 
 It would be overlooking the very substantial achievements of the procurement campaign because of a handful of individual instances of distortion of our line, distortions which have abso-lutely no warrant in the measures adopted by the Party. 
 Were there any circumstances which facilitated our procurement achievements and our fight against the at-tack of the capitalist elements in the countryside? Yes, there were. 
 One might mention at least two such circumstances. 
 Firstly, there is the fact that we secured the interven-tion of the Party in the procurement campaign and theblow at the kulak speculating elements after the Fif-teenth Congress of our Party, after the liquidation of the opposition, after the Party had attained the maximumunity by routing its Party enemies. 
 The fight against the kulaks must not be regarded as a trifling matter. 
 In order to defeat the machinations of the kulak specula-tors without causing any complications in the country, we need an absolutely united party, an absolutely firm rear and an absolutely firm government. 
 It can scarcelybe doubted that the existence of these factors was in a large degree instrumental in forcing the kulaks to beat an instantaneous retreat. 
 Secondly, there is the fact that we succeeded in link-ing our practical measures for curbing the kulak spec-ulating elements with the vital interests of the workingclass, the Red Army and the majority of the poorer sections of the rural population. 
 The fact that the ku-lak speculating elements were menacing the labouringmasses of town and country with the spectre of famine, and in addition were violating the laws of the Soviet Government (Article 107), could not but result in the majority of the rural population siding with us in our fight against the capitalist elements in the countryside. 
The kulak was scandalously speculating in grain, there-by creating the gravest difficulties both in town and country; in addition he was violating Soviet laws,that is, the will of the Central Executive Committee of Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’ and Red Army Men’s Deputies—is it not obvious that this circumstance wasbound to facilitate the work of isolating the kulaks? The pattern was in a way similar (with the appropri-ate reservations, of course) to the one we had in 1921,when, because of the famine in the country, the Party, headed by Lenin, raised the question of confiscating val-uables from the churches with a view to acquiring foodfor the famine-stricken regions, and made this the ba-sis of an extensive anti-religious campaign, and when the priests, by clinging to their valuables, were in factopposing the starving masses and thereby evoked the resentment of the masses against the Church in general and against religious prejudices in particular, and es-pecially against the priests and their leaders. 
 There were some queer people at that time in our Party who thought that Lenin had come to realise the necessity of combatingthe Church only in 1921 ( laughter )—that he had not real-ised it until then. 
 That, of course, was silly, comrades. 
 Lenin, of course, realised the necessity of combating theChurch before 1921 too. 
 But that was not the point. 
 The point was to link a broad mass anti-religious campaign with the struggle for the vital interests of the masses,and to conduct it in such a way that it was understood by the masses and supported by them. 
 The same must be said of the Party’s manoeuvre at the beginning of this year in connection with the grain procurement campaign. 
 There are people who think thatthe Party has only now come to realise the necessity of a struggle against the kulak danger. 
 That, of course, is silly, comrades. 
 The Party has always realised the ne-cessity for such a struggle and has waged it not in words, but in deeds. 
 The specific feature of the manoeuvre un-dertaken by the Party at the beginning of this year isthat this year the Party had the opportunity to link a determined struggle against the kulak speculating elements in the countryside with the struggle for the vi-tal interests of the broad masses of the working people, and by means of this link it succeeded in winning the following of the majority of the labouring masses in thecountryside and isolating the kulaks. 
 The art of Bolshevik policy by no means consists in firing indiscriminately with all your guns on all fronts,regardless of conditions of time and place, and regardless of whether the masses are ready to support this or that step of the leadership. 
 The art of Bolshevik policy con-sists in being able to choose the time and place and to take all the circumstances into account in order to con-centrate fire on the front where the maximum resultsare to be attained most quickly. 
 What results, indeed, should we now be having if are had undertaken a powerful blow at the kulaks threeyears ago, when we did not yet have the firm backing of the middle peasant, when the middle peasant was in-furiated and was violently attacking the chairmen ofour volost executive committees, when the poor peas-ants were dismayed at the consequences of NEP, when we had only 75 per cent of the pre-war crop area, when we were confronted with the basic problem of expanding the production of food and raw materials in the coun-tryside, and when we did not yet have a substantial food and raw materials base for industry? I have no doubt that we would have lost the battle, that we would not have succeeded in enlarging the crop area to the extent that we have succeeded in doing now, that we would have undermined the possibility of creat-ing a food and raw materials base for industry, that we would have facilitated the strengthening of the kulaks, and that we would have repelled the middle peasants,and that, possibly, we would now be having most seri-ous political complications in the country. 
 What was the position in the countryside at the be-ginning of this year? Crop areas enlarged to pre-war di-mensions, a securer raw materials and food base for industry, the majority of the middle peasants firmlybacking the Soviet Government, a more or less organ-ised poor peasantry, improved and stronger Party and Soviet organisations in the countryside. 
 Is it not obvi-ous that only because of these conditions were we able to count on serious success in organising a blow at the kulak speculating elements? Is it not clear that onlyimbeciles could fail to understand the vast difference between these two situations in the matter of organising a broad struggle of the masses against the capitalist ele-ments in the countryside? There you have an example of how unwise it is to fire indiscriminately with all your guns on all fronts,regardless of conditions of time and place, and regardless of the relation between the contending forces. 
 That, comrades, is how matters stand with regard to the grain procurements. 
 Let us pass now to the Shakhty affair. 
 III THE SHAKHTY AFFAIR What was the class background of the Shakhty af-fair? Where do the roots of the Shakhty affair lie hid-den, and from what class basis could this economic counter-revolution have sprung? There are comrades who think that the Shakhty af-fair was something accidental. 
 They usually say: We were properly caught napping, we allowed our attentionto slip; but if we had not been caught napping, there would have been no Shakhty affair. 
 That there was an oversight here, and a pretty serious one, is beyond alldoubt. 
 But to put it all down to an oversight means to understand nothing of the essence of the matter. 
 What do the facts, the documents in the Shakhty case, show? The facts show that the Shakhty affair was an eco-nomic counter-revolution, plotted by a section of thebourgeois experts, former coal-owners. 
 The facts show, further, that these experts were band-ed together in a secret group and were receiving moneyfor sabotage purposes from former owners now living abroad and from counter-revolutionary anti-Soviet cap-italist organisations in the West. 
 The facts show, lastly, that this group of bourgeois experts operated and wrought destruction to our indus-try on orders from capitalist organisations in the West. 
 And what does all this indicate? It indicates that it is a matter here of economic intervention in our industrial affairs by West-Europeananti-Soviet capitalist organisations. 
 At one time there was military and political intervention, which we suc-ceeded in liquidating by means of a victorious civil war. 
Now we have an attempt at economic intervention, for the liquidation of which we do not need a civil war, but which we must liquidate all the same, and shallliquidate with all the means at our disposal. 
 It would be foolish to believe that international cap-ital will leave us in peace. 
 No, comrades, that is nottrue. 
 Classes exist, international capital exists, and it cannot look on calmly at the development of the country that is building socialism. 
 Formerly, international cap-ital thought it could overthrow the Soviet regime by means of outright armed intervention. 
 The attempt failed. 
 Now it is trying, and will go on trying, to under-mine our economic strength by means of inconspicuous, not always noticeable but quite considerable, economic intervention, organising sabotage, engineering all sorts of“crises” in this or that branch of industry, and thereby facilitating the possibility of armed intervention in the future. 
 All this is woven into the web of the class struggleof international capital against the Soviet regime, and there can be no question of anything accidental here. 
 One thing or the other:either we continue to pursue a revolutionary poli-cy, rallying the proletarians and the oppressed of all countries around the working class of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
—inwhich case international capital will do everything it can to hinder our advance; or we renounce our revolutionary policy and agree to make a number of fundamental concessions to inter-national capital—in which case international capital,no doubt, will not be averse to “assisting” us in con-verting our socialist country into a “good” bourgeois republic. 
 There are people who think that we can conduct an emancipatory foreign policy and at the same time have the European and American capitalists praising us for do-ing so. 
 I shall not stop to show that such naive people do not and cannot have anything in common with our Party. 
 Britain, for instance, demands that we join her in establishing predatory spheres of influence somewhere or other, in Persia, Afghanistan or Turkey, say, and as-sures us that if we made this concession, she would beprepared to establish “friendship” with us. 
 Well, what do you say, comrades, perhaps we should make this con-cession? Chorus of shouts . 
 No! Stalin . 
 America demands that we renounce in princi-ple the policy of supporting the emancipation movementof the working class in other countries, and says that if we made this concession everything would go smoothly. 
 Well, what do you say, comrades, perhaps we shouldmake this concession? Chorus of shouts . 
 No! Stalin . 
 We could establish “friendly” relations with Japan if we agreed to join her in dividing up Manchuria. 
 Can we make this concession? Chorus of shouts . 
 No! Stalin . 
 Or, for instance, the demand is made that we “loosen” our foreign trade monopoly and agree to repay all the war and pre-war debts. 
 Perhaps we should agree to this, comrades? Chorus of shouts . 
 No! Stalin . 
 But precisely because we cannot agree to these or similar concessions without being false to ourselves —precisely because of this we must take it for grant-ed that international capital will go on playing us ev-ery sort of scurvy trick, whether it be a Shakhty affair or something else of a similar nature. 
 There you have the class roots of the Shakhty affair. 
 Why was armed intervention by international capi-tal possible in our country? Because there were in ourcountry whole groups of military experts, generals and officers, scions of the bourgeoisie and the landlords, who were always ready to undermine the foundationsof the Soviet regime. 
 Could these officers and generals have organised a serious war against the Soviet regime if they had not received financial, military and everyother kind of assistance from international capital? Of course not. 
 Could international capital have organised serious intervention without the assistance of this groupof whiteguard officers and generals? I do not think so. 
 There were comrades among us at that time who thought that the armed intervention was something ac-cidental, that if we had not released Krasnov, Mamon-tov and the rest from prison, there would have been no intervention. 
 That, of course, is untrue. 
 That the releaseof Mamontov, Krasnov and the other whiteguard gen-erals did play a part in the development of civil war is beyond doubt. 
 But that the roots of the armed interven-tion lay not in this, but in the class contradictions be-tween the Soviet regime on the one hand, and interna-tional capital and its lackey generals in Russia on the other, is also beyond doubt. 
 Could certain bourgeois experts, former mine own-ers, have organised the Shakhty affair here without the financial and moral support of international capital, without the prospect of international capital helping themto overthrow the Soviet regime? Of course not. 
 Could international capital have organised in our country eco-nomic intervention, such as the Shakhty affair, if therehad not been in our country a bourgeoisie, including a certain group of bourgeois experts who were ready to go to all lengths to destroy the Soviet regime? Obvious-ly not. 
 Do there exist at all such groups of bourgeois ex-perts in our country as are ready to go to the length of economic intervention, of undermining the Soviet regime?I think there do. 
 I do not think that there can be many of them. 
 But that there do exist in our country certain insignificant groups of counter-revolutionary bourgeoisexperts—far fewer than at the time of the armed in-tervention—is beyond doubt. 
 It is the combination of these two forces that creates the soil for economic intervention in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 And it is precisely this that constitutes the class background of the Shakhty affair. 
 Now about the practical conclusions to be drawn from the Shakhty affair. 
 I should like to dwell upon four practical conclusions indicated by the Shakhty affair. 
 Lenin used to say that selection of personnel is one of the cardinal problems in the building of socialism. 
The Shakhty affair shows that we selected our economic cadres badly, and not only selected them badly, but placed them in conditions which hampered their devel-opment. 
 Reference is made to Order 33, and especially to the “Model Regulations” accompanying the order. 
14 It is a characteristic feature of these model regulations that they confer practically all the rights on the technical director, leaving to the general director the right tosettle conflicts, to “represent,” in short, to twiddle his thumbs. 
 It is obvious that under such circumstances our economic cadres could not develop as they should. 
 There was a time when this order was absolutely nec-essary, because when it was issued we had no economic cadres of our own, we did not know how to manageindustry, and had willy-nilly to assign the major rights to the technical director. 
 But now this order has become a fetter. 
 Now we have our own economic cadreswith experience and capable of developing into real leaders of our industry. 
 And for this very reason the time has come to abolish the obsolete model regulationsand to replace them by new ones. 
 It is said that it is impossible for Communists, and especially communist business executives who comefrom the working class, to master chemical formulas or technical knowledge in general. 
 That is not true, com-rades. 
 There are no fortresses that the working people, theBolsheviks, cannot capture. 
 ( Applause . 
) We captured tougher fortresses than these in the course of our strug-gle against the bourgeoisie. 
 Everything depends on thedesire to master technical knowledge and on arming our-selves with persistence and Bolshevik patience. 
 But in or-der to alter the conditions of work of our economic cadresand to help them to become real and full-fledged mas-ters of their job, we must abolish the old model regula-tions and replace them by new ones. 
 Otherwise, we run the risk of maiming our personnel. 
 Were some of our business executives who have now deteriorated worse than any of us? Why is it that they, and other comrades like them, began to deteriorate and degenerate and come to identify themselves in their wayof living with the bourgeois experts? It is due to our wrong way of doing things in the business field; it is due to our business executives being selected and havingto work in conditions which hinder their development, which convert them into appendages of the bourgeois experts. 
 This way of doing things must be discarded,comrades. 
 The second conclusion indicated to us by the Shakhty affair is that our cadres are being taught badly in ourtechnical colleges, that our Red experts are not being trained properly. 
 That is a conclusion from which there is no escaping. 
 Why is it, for example, that many ofour young experts do not get down to the job, and have turned out to be unsuitable for work in industry? Because they learned from books, they are book-taught experts,they have no practical experience, are divorced from production, and, naturally, prove a failure. 
 But is it really such experts we need? No, it is not such expertswe need, be they young experts three times over. 
 We need experts—whether Communists or non-Communists makes no difference—who are strong not only in theorybut also in practical experience, in their connection with production. 
 A young expert who has never seen a mine and does not want to go down a mine, a young expert who has nev-er seen a factory and does not want to soil his hands in a factory, will never get the upper hand over the old experts, who have been steeled by practical experience but are hostile to our cause. 
 It is easy to understand,therefore, why such young experts are given an un-friendly reception not only by the old experts, and not only by our business executives, but often even by theworkers. 
 But if we are not to have such surprises with our young experts, the method of training them must be changed, and changed in such a way that already intheir first years of training in the technical colleges they have continuous contact with production, with factory, mine and so forth. 
 The third conclusion concerns the question of en-listing the broad mass of the workers in the management of industry. 
 What is the position in this respect, as re-vealed by the Shakhty evidence? Very bad. 
 Shockingly bad, comrades. 
 It has been revealed that the labour laws are violated, that the six-hour working day in under-ground work is not always observed, that safety regula-tions are ignored. 
 Yet the workers tolerate it. 
 And the trade unions say nothing. 
 And the Party organisationstake no steps to put a stop to this scandal. 
 A comrade who recently visited the Donbas went down the pits and questioned the miners about theirconditions of work. 
 It is a remarkable thing that not one of the miners thought it necessary to complain of the conditions. 
 “How is life with you, comrades?” this com-rade asked them. 
 “All right, comrade, we are living not so badly,” the miners replied. 
 “I am going to Moscow, what should I tell the centre?” he asked. 
 “Say that weare living not so badly,” was their answer. 
 “Listen, com-rades, I am not a foreigner, I am a Russian, and I have come here to learn the truth from you,” the comrade said. 
 “That’s all one to us, comrade, we tell nothing but the truth whether to foreigners or to our own people,”the miners replied. 
 That’s the stuff our miners are made of. 
 They are not just workers, they are heroes. 
 There you have thatwealth of moral capital we have succeeded in amassing in the hearts of the workers. 
 And only to think that we are squandering this invaluable moral capital so iniqui-tously and criminally, like profligate and dissolute heirs to the magnificent legacy of the October Revolution! But, comrades, we cannot carry on for long on the oldmoral capital if we squander it so recklessly. 
 It is time to stop doing that. 
 High time! Finally, the fourth conclusion concerns checking fulfilment. 
 The Shakhty affair has shown that as far as checking fulfilment is concerned, things could not be worse than they are in all spheres of administra-tion—in the Party, in industry, in the trade unions. 
 Res-olutions are written, directives are sent out, but nobody wants to take the trouble to ask how matters stand withthe carrying out of those resolutions and directives, whether they are really being carried out or are sim-ply pigeon-holed. 
 Ilyich used to say that one of the most serious ques-tions in administering the country is the checking of ful-filment. 
 Yet precisely here things could not possiblybe worse. 
 Leadership does not just mean writing resolu-tions and sending out directives. 
 Leadership means check-ing fulfilment of directives, and not only their ful-filment, but the directives themselves—whether they are right or wrong from the point of view of the actual practical work. 
 It would be absurd to think that all our di-rectives are 100 per cent correct. 
 That is never so, and cannot be so, comrades. 
 Checking fulfilment consists pre-cisely in our leading personnel testing in the crucible of practical experience not only the way our directives are being fulfilled, but the correctness of the directives them-selves. 
 Consequently, faults in this field signify that there are faults in all our work of leadership. 
 Take, for example, the checking of fulfilment in the purely Party sphere. 
 It is our custom to invite secre-taries of okrug and gubernia committees to make reports to the Central Committee, in order to check how theC. 
C. 
’s directives are being carried out. 
 The secretaries report, they confess to shortcomings in their work. 
 The C. 
C. 
 takes them to task and passes stereotyped resolu-tions instructing them to give greater depth and breadth to their work, to lay stress on this or that, to pay seri-ous attention to this or that, etc. 
 The secretaries go backwith those resolutions. 
 Then we invite them again, and the same thing is repeated about giving greater depth and breadth to the work and so on and so forth. 
 I do notsay that all this work is entirely without value. 
 No, comrades, it has its good sides in educating and bracing up our organisations. 
 But it must be admitted that thismethod of checking fulfilment is no longer sufficient. 
 It must be admitted that this method has to be supple-mented by another, namely, the method of assigningmembers of our top Party and Soviet leadership to work in the localities. 
 ( A voice : “A good idea!”) What I have in mind is the sending of leading comrades to thelocalities for temporary work, not as commanders, but as ordinary functionaries placed at the disposal of the local organisations. 
 I think that this idea has a big fu-ture and may improve the work of checking fulfilment, if it is carried out honestly and conscientiously. 
 If members of the Central Committee, members of the Presidium of the Central Control Commission, Peo-ple’s Commissars and their deputies, members of thePresidium of the A. 
U. 
C. 
C. 
T. 
U. 
, and members of presid-iums of trade-union central committees were to go reg-ularly to the localities and work there, in order to getan idea of how things are being done, to study all the dif-ficulties, all the good sides and bad sides, then I can as-sure you that this would be the most valuable and effec-tive way of checking fulfilment. 
 It would be the best way of enriching the experience of our highly respected leaders. 
 And if this were to become a regular practice—and it certainly must become a regular practice—I can assure you that the laws which we write here and the directives which we elaborate would be far more effec-tive and to the point than is the case now. 
 So much, comrades, for the Shakhty affair. 
 IV GENERAL CONCLUSION We have internal enemies. 
 We have external enemies. 
 This, comrades, must not be forgotten for a single mo-ment. 
 We had a procurement crisis, which has already been liquidated. 
 The procurement crisis marked the firstserious attack on the Soviet regime launched by the capitalist elements of the countryside under NEP con-ditions. 
 We have the Shakhty affair, which is already being liquidated and undoubtedly will be liquidated. 
 The Shakhty affair marks another serious attack on the So-viet regime launched by international capital and its agents in our country. 
 It is economic intervention in our internal affairs. 
 It need scarcely be said that these and similar at-tacks, both internal and external, may be repeated and in all likelihood will be repeated. 
 Our task is to exer-cise the maximum vigilance and to be on the alert. 
 And, comrades, if we are vigilant, we shall most certainly de-feat our enemies in the future, just as we are defeatingthem now and have defeated them in the past.

 102, May 4, 1928 SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE EIGHTH CONGRESS OF THE ALL-UNION LENINIST YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE15 May 16, 1928 Comrades, it is the accepted thing at congresses to speak of achievements. 
 That we have achievements is beyond question. 
 They, these achievements, are, of course, not inconsiderable, and there is no reason to hidethem. 
 But, comrades, it has become a practice with us lately to talk so much of achievements, and some-times so affectedly, that one loses all desire to speak ofthem once again. 
 Allow me, therefore, to depart from the general practice and to say a few words not about our achievements, but about our weaknesses and ourtasks in connection with these weaknesses. 
 I am referring, comrades, to the tasks involved by the questions of our internal work of construction. 
 These tasks relate to three questions: that of the line of our political work, that of stimulating the activ-ity of the broad mass of the people in general and ofthe working class in particular, and of stimulating the struggle against bureaucracy, and, lastly, that of train-ing new personnel for our work of economic construc-tion. 
 I STRENGTHEN THE READINESS FOR ACTION OF THE WORKING CLASS Let us begin with the first question. 
 The character-istic feature of the period we are now passing throughis that for five years already we have been building in conditions of peaceful development. 
 When I say peaceful development, I am referring not only to the absenceof war with external enemies, but also to the absence of the elements of civil war at home. 
 That is what we mean by conditions of the peaceful development of our workof construction. 
 You know that in order to win these conditions of peaceful development, we had to fight the capitalistsof the whole world for three years. 
 You know that we did win those conditions, and we consider that one of our greatest achievements. 
 But, comrades, every gain,and this gain is no exception, has its obverse side. 
 The conditions of peaceful development have not been with-out their effect on us. 
 They have laid their imprint onour work, on our executive personnel, on their mental-ity. 
 During these five years we have been advancing smoothly, as though on rails. 
 And the effect of thishas been to induce the belief in some of our execu-tives that everything is going swimmingly, that we are as good as travelling on an express train, and that weare being carried on the rails non-stop straight to so-cialism. 
 From this has sprung the theory of things going “of their own accord,” the theory of “muddling through,” the theory that “everything will come out right,” that there are no classes in our country, that our enemies have calmed down, and that everything will go according to the book. 
 Hence a certain tendency toinertia, to somnolence. 
 Well, it is this mentality of somnolence, this mentality of relying on the work going right “of its own accord” that constitutes the obverseside of the period of peaceful development. 
 Why are such states of mind so dangerous? Because they throw dust into the eyes of the working class, pre-vent it from seeing its enemies, lull it with boastful talk about the weakness of our enemies, undermine its readiness for action. 
 We must not allow ourselves to be reassured by the fact that we have a million members in our Party, two million in the Young Communist League and ten mil-lion in the trade unions, and believe that this is all that is required for complete victory over our enemies. 
 That is not true, comrades. 
 History tells us that someof the biggest armies perished because they grew con-ceited, had too much faith in their own strength, paid too little heed to the strength of their enemies, gavethemselves over to somnolence, lost their readiness for action, and at a critical moment were caught una-wares. 
 The biggest party may be caught unawares, the big-gest party may perish, if it does not learn the lessons of history and does not work day in and day out to forgethe readiness for action of its class. 
 To be caught unaware is a most dangerous thing, comrades. 
 To be caught un-awares is to fall prey to “surprises,” to panic in faceof the enemy. 
 And panic leads to break-down, to defeat, to destruction. 
 I could give you many examples from the history of our armies during the civil war, examples of small detachments routing big military formations when thelatter were lacking in readiness for action. 
 I could tell you how in 1920 three cavalry divisions, with a total of not less than 5,000 cavalrymen, were routed and put to dis-orderly flight by a single infantry battalion just because they, the cavalry divisions, were caught unawares and succumbed to panic in face of an enemy about whom theyknew nothing, and who was extremely weak numerical-ly and could have been shattered at one blow if these divi-sions had not been in a state of somnolence, and thenof panic and confusion. 
 The same must be said of our Party, our Young Com-munist League, our trade unions, our forces in general. 
It is not true that we no longer have class enemies, that they have been smashed and eliminated. 
 No, comrades, our class enemies still exist. 
 They not only exist, theyare growing and trying to take action against the Soviet Government. 
 That was shown by our procurement difficulties last winter, when the capitalist elements in the countryside tried to sabotage the policy of the Soviet Government. 
 It was shown by the Shakhty affair, which was the expression of a joint attack on the Soviet regime launched by international capital and the bourgeoisie in our country. 
 It is shown by numerous facts in the sphere of home and foreign policy, facts which are known to you and which there is no need to dwell on here. 
 To keep silent about these enemies of the working class would he wrong. 
 To underrate the strength of the class enemies of the working class would be criminal. 
 To keep silent about all this would be particularly wrong now, in the period of our peaceful development, whenthere is a certain favourable soil for the theory of som-nolence and of things going “of their own accord,” which undermines the readiness for action of the workingclass. 
 The procurement crisis and the Shakhty affair were of tremendous educational value, because they shookup all our organisations, discredited the theory of things going “of their own accord,” and once more stressed the existence of class enemies, showing that they are alive,are not dozing, and that in order to combat them we must enhance the strength of the working class, its vigilance, its revolutionary spirit, its readiness for action. 
 From this follows the immediate task of the Party, the political line of its day-to-day work: to enhance the readiness of the working class for action against itsclass enemies . 
 It must be said that this Y . 
C. 
L. 
 congress, and es-pecially Komsomolskaya Pravda , have now come closer than ever before to this task. 
 You know that the impor-tance of this task is being stressed by speakers here and by articles in Komsomolskaya Pravda . 
 That is very good, comrades. 
 It is necessary only that this task should not be regarded as a temporary and transient one, for the task of enhancing the readiness of the proletariatfor action is one that must imbue all our work so long as there are classes in our country and so long as capital-ist encirclement exists. 
 II ORGANISE MASS CRITICISM BELOW The second question concerns the task of combating bureaucracy, of organising mass criticism of our short-comings, of organising mass control from below. 
 Bureaucracy is one of the worst enemies of our prog-ress. 
 It exists in all our organisations—Party, Y. 
C. 
L. 
,trade-union and economic. 
 When people talk of bureau-crats, they usually point to the old non-Party officials, who as a rule are depicted in our cartoons as men wearingspectacles. 
 ( Laughter . 
) That is not quite true, comrades. 
 If it were only a question of the old bureaucrats, the fight against bureaucracy would be very easy. 
 Thetrouble is that it is not a matter of the old bureaucrats. 
 It is a matter of the new bureaucrats, bureaucrats who sympathise with the Soviet Government, and finally,communist bureaucrats. 
 The communist bureaucrat is the most dangerous type of bureaucrat. 
 Why? Because he masks his bureaucracy with the title of Party mem-ber. 
 And, unfortunately, we have quite a number of such communist bureaucrats. 
 Take our Party organisations. 
 You have no doubt read about the Smolensk affair, the Artyomovsk affair and so on. 
 What do you think, were they matters of chance? What is the explanation of these shamefulinstances of corruption and moral deterioration in certain of our Party organisations? The fact that Party monopoly was carried to absurd lengths, that the voiceof the rank and file was stifled, that inner-Party democ-racy was abolished and bureaucracy became rife. 
 How is this evil to be combated? I think that there is not and cannot be any other way of combating this evil than by organising control from below by the Party masses,by implanting inner-Party democracy. 
 What objection can there be to rousing the fury of the mass of the Party membership against these corrupt elements and giv-ing it the opportunity to send such elements packing? There can hardly be any objection to that. 
 Or take the Young Communist League, for instance. 
 You will not deny, of course, that here and there in the Young Communist League there are utterly corrupt ele-ments against whom it is absolutely essential to wage aruthless struggle. 
 But let us leave aside the corrupt elements. 
 Let us take the latest fact of an unprincipled struggle waged by groups within the Young CommunistLeague around personalities, a struggle which is poison-ing the atmosphere in the Young Communist League. 
 Why is it that you can find as many “Kosarevites” and“Sobolevites” as you like in the Young Communist League, while Marxists have to be looked for with a candle? (Applause . 
) What does this indicate, if not that a proc-ess of bureaucratic petrification is taking place in cer-tain sections of the Y . 
C. 
L. 
 top leadership? And the trade unions? Who will deny that in the trade unions there is bureaucracy in plenty? We have production conferences in the factories. 
 We have tempo-rary control commissions in the trade unions. 
 It is the taskof these organisations to rouse the masses, to bring our shortcomings to light and to indicate ways and means of improving our constructive work. 
 Why are these or-ganisations not developing? Why are they not seething with activity? Is it not obvious that it is bureaucracy in the trade unions, coupled with bureaucracy in the Party organisations, that is preventing these highly important organisations of the working class from developing? Lastly, our economic organisations. 
 Who will deny that our economic bodies suffer from bureaucracy? Take the Shakhty affair as an illustration. 
 Does not theShakhty affair indicate that our economic bodies are not speeding ahead, but crawling, dragging their feet? How are we to put an end to bureaucracy in all these organisations? There is only one sole way of doing this, and that is to organise control from below, to organise criticismof the bureaucracy in our institutions, of their short-comings and their mistakes, by the vast masses of the working class. 
 I know that by rousing the fury of the masses of the working people against the bureaucratic distortions in our organisations, we sometimes have to tread on thetoes of some of our comrades who have past services to their credit, but who are now suffering from the disease of bureaucracy. 
 But ought this to stop our work of organ-ising control from below? I think that it ought not and must not. 
 For their past services we should take off our hats to them, but for their present blunders and bureauc-racy it would be quite in order to give them a good drubbing. 
 ( Laughter and applause . 
) How else? Why not do this if the interests of the work demand it? There is talk of criticism from above, criticism by the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, by the Cen-tral Committee of our Party and so on. 
 That, of course,is all very good. 
 But it is still far from enough. 
 More, it is by no means the chief thing now. 
 The chief thing now is to start a broad tide of criticism from below against bureaucracy in general, against shortcomings in our work in particular. 
 Only by organising twofold pressure—from above and from below—and only by shifting the principal stress to criticism from below, can we count on waging a successful struggle against bureaucracy andon rooting it out. 
 It would be a mistake to think that only the lead-ers possess experience in constructive work. 
 That isnot true, comrades. 
 The vast masses of the workers who are engaged in building our industry are day by day accumulating vast experience in construction, ex-perience which is not a whit less valuable to us than the experience of the leaders. 
 Mass criticism from below, control from below, is needed by us in order that, amongother things, this experience of the vast masses should not be wasted, but be reckoned with and translated into practice. 
 From this follows the immediate task of the Par-ty: to wage a ruthless struggle against bureaucracy , to or-ganise mass criticism from below , and to take this criticism into account when adopting practical decisions for elimi-nating our shortcomings . 
 It cannot be said that the Young Communist League, and especially Komsomolskaya Pravda , have not appre-ciated the importance of this task. 
 The shortcoming here is that often the fulfilment of this task is not carried outcompletely. 
 And in order to carry it out completely, it is necessary to give heed not only to criticism, but also to the results of criticism, to the improvementsthat are introduced as a result of criticism. 
 III THE YOUTH MUST MASTER SCIENCE The third task concerns the question of organising new cadres for socialist construction. 
 Before us, comrades, lies the gigantic task of reconstruct-ing our entire national economy. 
 In the sphere of agri-culture, we must lay the foundation of large-scale, united, socially-conducted farming. 
 You no doubt knowfrom Comrade Molotov’s manifesto 16 published today that the Soviet Government is tackling the very formidable talk of uniting the small, scattered peasant farmsinto collective farms and creating new large state farms for grain production. 
 Unless these tasks are accomplished, substantial and rapid progress will be im-possible. 
 Whereas in industry the Soviet regime rests upon the largest-scale and most highly concentrated form of pro-duction, in agriculture it rests upon the most scattered and small-scale peasant economy, which is of a semi-commodity character and yields a far smaller surplusof marketable grain than the pre-war economy, despite the fact that the crop areas have reached pre-war lev-els. 
 That is the basis for all sorts of difficulties that mayarise in the sphere of grain procurements in future. 
 In order to extricate ourselves from this situation, we must seriously set about organising large-scale socially-conduct-ed production in agriculture. 
 But in order to organise large-scale farming, we must have a knowledge of agri-cultural science. 
 And knowledge entails study. 
 Yet wehave scandalously few people with a knowledge of agricultural science. 
 Hence the task of training new, young cadres of builders of a new, socially-conducted agriculture. 
 In the sphere of industry the situation is much bet-ter. 
 But, here, too, lack of new cadres of builders is re-tarding our progress. 
 It suffices to recall the Shakhty affair to realise how acute the problem is of training newcadres of builders of socialist industry. 
 Of course, we have old experts in the building of industry. 
 But, firstly, there are very few of them, secondly, not all of themwant to build a new industry, thirdly, many of them do not understand the new construction tasks, and, fourth-ly, a large proportion of them are already old and aregoing out of commission. 
 In order to advance matters, we must train at a high speed new cadres of experts, drawn from the working class, the Communists and mem-bers of the Young Communist League. 
 We have plenty of people who are willing to build and to direct the work of construction both in agricul-ture and in industry. 
 But we have scandalously few peo-ple who know how to build and direct. 
 On the contra-ry, our ignorance in this sphere is abysmal. 
 More, thereare people among us who are prepared to extol our lack of knowledge. 
 If you are illiterate or cannot write gram-matically and are proud of your backwardness—youare a worker “at the bench,” you deserve honour and re-spect. 
 But if you have climbed out of your ignorance, have learned to read and write and have mastered sci-ence—you are an alien element who has “broken away” from the masses, you have ceased to be a worker. 
 I consider that we shall not advance a single step until we root out this barbarism and boorishness, this barbaric attitude towards science and men of cul- /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR ture. 
 The working class cannot become the real master of the country if it does not succeed in overcoming its lack of culture, if it does not succeed in creating its ownintelligentsia, if it does not master science and learn to administer economy on scientific lines. 
 It must be realised, comrades, that the conditions of the struggle today are not what they were at the time of the civil war. 
 At the time of the civil war it was pos-sible to capture enemy positions by dash, courage, daring,by cavalry assaults. 
 Today, in the conditions of peace-ful economic construction, cavalry assaults can only do harm. 
 Courage and daring are needed now as much asbefore. 
 But courage and daring alone will not carry us very far. 
 In order to beat the enemy now, we must know how to build industry, agriculture, transport, trade; wemust abandon the haughty and supercilious attitude to-wards trade. 
 In order to build, we must have knowledge, mastery of science. 
 And knowledge entails study. 
 We must study perseveringly and patiently. 
 We must learn from every-one, both from our enemies and from our friends,especially from our enemies. 
 We must clench our teeth and study, not fearing that our enemies may laugh at us, at our ignorance, at our backwardness. 
 Before us stands a fortress. 
 That fortress is called science, with its numerous branches of knowledge. 
 We must capture that fortress at all costs. 
 It is our youthwho must capture that fortress, if they want to be build-ers of the new life, if they want to be real successors of the old guard. 
 We cannot now confine ourselves to training communist cadres in general , Bolshevik cadres in general , people who are able to prattle a little about everything. 
 Dilettantism and the know-all attitude are now shackles on our feet. 
 We now need Bolshevik experts in metal-lurgy, textiles, fuel, chemistry, agriculture, transport, trade, accountancy, and so on and so forth. 
 We now need whole groups, hundreds and thousands of new Bolshe-vik cadres capable of becoming masters of their subject in the most diverse branches of knowledge. 
 Failing this, it is useless to think of any swift rate of socialist con-struction in our country. 
 Failing this, it is useless to think that we can overtake and outstrip the advanced capi-talist countries. 
 We must master science , we must train new cadres of Bolshevik experts in all branches of knowledge , we must study , study and study most perseveringly . 
 That is the task now. 
 A mass campaign of the revolutionary youth for science —that is what we need now, comrades.

 113, May 17, 1928 TO KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA On Its Tenth Anniversary Friendly greetings to Komsomolskaya Pravda , the militant organ of our worker and peasant youth! I wish it success on the difficult front of training the youth for an implacable struggle against the enemies of the working class, for the struggle for the completevictory of communism all over the world! Let Komsomolskaya Pravda be a signal bell that arouses the slumbering, heartens the weary, urges on thestragglers, scourges bureaucracy in our institutions, re-veals shortcomings in our work, gives prominence to our achievements in construction, and thus facilitates thetraining of new people, of new builders of socialism, a new generation of young men and women capable of succeeding the old guard of Bolsheviks! The strength of our revolution lies in the fact that there is no division between our old and new generationsof revolutionaries. 
 We owe our victories to the fact thatthe old guard and the young guard march shoulder to shoulder, in a united front, in a single column, against our enemies, internal as well as external. 
 The task is to preserve and fortify this unity. 
Let Komsomolskaya Pravda be an untiring advocate of the unity of the old and the young guard of Bolsheviks! J.

 122, May 27, 1928 TO THE SVERDLOV UNIVERSITY On Its Tenth Anniversary The ten years’ existence of the Sverdlov University17 is a signal achievement of the Party on the front of the struggle for training new Leninist cadres. 
 In these ten years the Sverdlov University has given the Party hundreds and thousands of young forces whoare devoted to the cause of communism and have become successors to the old guard of Bolsheviks. 
 In these ten years the university has fully justified its existence and shown that it is not for nothing that it bears the name of its founder, that foremost champion of communism, Y .

 122, May 27, 1928 ON THE GRAIN FRONT From a Talk to Students of the Institute of Red Professors, the Communist Academy and the Sverdlov University May 28, 1928 Question : What should be considered as the basic cause of our difficulties in the matter of the grainsupply? What is the way out of these difficulties? What, in connection with these difficulties, are the conclusions that must be drawn as regards the rate of developmentof our industry, particularly from the point of view of the relation between the light and heavy industries? Answer : At first sight it may appear that our grain difficulties are an accident, the result merely of faulty planning, the result merely of a number of mistakes committed in the sphere of economic co-ordination. 
 But it may appear so only at first sight. 
 Actually the causes of the difficulties lie much deeper. 
 That faulty planning and mistakes in economic co-ordination haveplayed a considerable part—of that there cannot be any doubt. 
 But to attribute everything to faulty plan-ning and chance mistakes would be a gross error. 
 Itwould be an error to belittle the role and importance of planning. 
 But it would be a still greater error to exag-gerate the part played by the planning principle, in thebelief that we have already reached a stage of develop-ment when it is possible to plan and regulate every-thing. 
 It must not be forgotten that in addition to elements which lend themselves to our planning activities there are also other elements in our national economy which do not as yet lend themselves to planning; and that, last-ly, there are classes hostile to us which cannot be over-come simply by the planning of the State Planning Commission. 
 That is why I think that we must not reduce every-thing to a mere accident, to mistakes in planning, etc. 
 And so, what is the basis of our difficulties on the grain front? The basis of our grain difficulties lies in the fact that the increase in the production of marketable grain is not keeping pace with the increase in the demand for grain. 
 Industry is growing. 
 The number of workers is grow-ing. 
 Towns are growing. 
 And, lastly, the areas producing industrial crops (cotton, flax, sugar beet, etc. 
) are grow-ing, creating a demand for grain. 
 All this leads to a rap-id increase in the demand for grain—grain available for the market. 
 But the production of marketable grainis increasing at a disastrously slow rate. 
 It cannot be said that the grain stocks at the disposal of the state have been smaller this year than last, orthe year before. 
 On the contrary, we have had far more grain in the hands of the state this year than in previous years. 
 Nevertheless, we are faced with difficulties asregards the grain supply. 
 Here are a few figures. 
 In 1925-26 we managed to procure 434,000,000 poods of grain by April 1. 
 Of thisamount, 123,000,000 poods were exported. 
 Thus, there remained in the country 311,000,000 poods of the grain procured. 
 In 1926-27 we had procured 596,000,000poods of grain by April 1. 
 Of this amount, 153,000,000 poods were exported. 
 There remained in the country 443,000,000 poods. 
 In 1927-28 we had procured 576,000,000 poods of grain by April 1. 
 Of this amount, 27,000,000 poods were exported. 
 There remained in the country549,000,000 poods. 
 In other words, this year, by April 1, the grain sup-plies available to meet the requirements of the countryamounted to 100,000,000 poods more than last year, and 230,000,000 poods more than the year before last. 
 Nevertheless, we are experiencing difficulties on thegrain front this year. 
 I have already said in one of my reports that the capitalist elements in the countryside, and primarilythe kulaks, took advantage of these difficulties in order to disrupt Soviet economic policy. 
 You know that the Soviet government adopted a number of measures aimedat putting a stop to the anti-Soviet action of the kulaks. 
 I shall not therefore dwell on this matter here. 
 In the present case it is another question that interests me. 
I have in mind the reasons for the slow increase in the production of marketable grain, the question why the increase in the production of marketable grain in ourcountry is slower than the increase in the demand for grain, in spite of the fact that our crop area and the gross production of grain have already reached the pre-war level. 
 Indeed, is it not a fact that our grain crop area has already reached the pre-war mark? Yes, it is a fact. 
Is it not a fact that already last year the gross pro-duction of grain was equal to the pre-war output, i. 
e. 
, 5,000 million poods? Yes, it is a fact. 
 How, then, isit to be explained that, in spite of these circumstances, the amount of marketable grain we are producing is only one half, and the amount we are exporting is only about one-twentieth, of the pre-war figure? The reason is primarily and chiefly the change in the structure of our agriculture brought about by the October Revolution, the passing from large-scale land-lord and large-scale kulak farming, which provided thelargest amount of marketable grain, to small-and mid-dle-peasant farming, which provides the smallest amount of marketable grain. 
 The mere fact that before the warthere were 15,000,000 to 16,000,000 individual peasant farms, whereas at present there are 24,000,000 to 25,000,000 peasant farms, shows that now the basis ofour agriculture is essentially small-peasant farming, which provides the least amount of marketable grain. 
 The strength of large-scale farming, irrespective of whether it is landlord, kulak or collective farming, lies in the fact that large farms are able to employ ma-chines, scientific methods, fertilizers, to increase theproductivity of labour, and thus to produce the maxi-mum quantity of marketable grain. 
 On the other hand, the weakness of small-peasant farming lies in the factthat it lacks, or almost lacks, these opportunities, and as a result it is semi-consuming farming, yielding little marketable grain. 
 Take, for instance, the collective farms and the state farms. 
 They market 47. 
2 per cent of their gross output of grain. 
 In other words, they yield relatively moremarketable grain than did landlord farming in pre-war days. 
 But what about the small-and middle-peasant farms? They market only 11. 
2 per cent of their totaloutput of grain. 
 The difference, as you see, is quite striking. 
 Here are a few figures illustrating the structure of grain production in the past, in the pre-war period, and at present, in the post-October period. 
 These fig-ures were supplied by Comrade Nemchinov, a member of the Collegium of the Central Statistical Board. 
 It is not claimed that these figures are exact, as ComradeNemchinov explains in his memorandum; they permit of only approximate calculations. 
 But they are quite adequate to enable us to understand the differencebetween the pre-war period and the post-October period as regards the structure of grain production in general, and the production of marketable grain in particular.

3 What does this table show? It shows, firstly, that the production of the over-whelming proportion of grain products has passed fromthe landlords and kulaks to the small and middle peasants. 
 This means that the small and middle peasants, having completely emancipated themselves from the yoke of thelandlords, and having, in the main, broken the strength of the kulaks, have thereby been enabled considera-bly to improve their material conditions. 
 That is theresult of the October Revolution. 
 Here we see the effect, primarily, of the decisive gain which accrued to the main mass of the peasantry as a result of the OctoberRevolution. 
 It shows, secondly, that in our country the prin-cipal holders of marketable grain are the small and, pri-marily, the middle peasants. 
 This means that not only as regards gross production of grain, but also as regards the production of marketable grain, the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 hasbecome, as a result of the October Revolution, a land of small-peasant farming, and the middle peasant has become the “central figure” in agriculture. 
 It shows, thirdly, that the abolition of landlord (large-scale) farming, the reduction of kulak (large-scale) farming to less than one-third, and the passingto small-peasant farming with only 11 per cent of its output marketed, in the absence, in the sphere of grain production, of any more or less developed large-scalesocially-conducted farming (collective farms and state farms), were bound to lead, and in fact have led, to a sharp reduction in the production of marketable grain ascompared with pre-war times. 
 It is a fact that the amount of marketable grain in our country is now half what it was before the war, although the gross output of grain has reached the pre-war level. 
 That is the basis of our difficulties on the grain front. 
 That is why our difficulties in the sphere of grain procurements must not be regarded as a mere accident. 
 No doubt the situation has been aggravated to some extent by the fact that our trading organisations took upon themselves the unnecessary task of supplying grainto a number of small and middle-sized towns, and this was bound to reduce to a certain extent the state’s grain reserves. 
 But there are no grounds whatever fordoubting that the basis of our difficulties on the grain front lies not in this particular circumstance, but in the slow development of the output of our agriculturefor the market, accompanied by a rapid increase in the demand for marketable grain. 
 What is the way out of this situation?Some people see the way out of this situation in a return to kulak farming, in the development and exten-sion of kulak farming. 
 These people dare not speak ofa return to landlord farming, for they realise, evident-ly, that such talk is dangerous in our times. 
 All the more eagerly, however, do they speak of the necessityof the utmost development of kulak farming in the in-terests of—the Soviet regime. 
 These people think that the Soviet regime can rely simultaneously on two op-posite classes—the class of the kulaks, whose economic principle is the exploitation of the working class, and the class of the workers, whose economic principle isthe abolition of all exploitation. 
 A trick worthy of reactionaries. 
 There is no need to prove that these reactionary “plans” have nothing in common with the interests of the working class, with the principles of Marxism, withthe tasks of Leninism. 
 Talk about the kulak being “no worse” than the urban capitalist, about the kulak be-ing no more dangerous than the urban Nepman, andtherefore, about there being no reason to “fear” the kulaks now—such talk is sheer liberal chatter which lulls the vigilance of the working class and of the main massof the peasantry. 
 It must not be forgotten that in indus-try we can oppose to the small urban capitalist our large-scale socialist industry, which produces nine-tenths of the total output of manufactured goods, whereas in the countryside we can oppose to large-scale kulak farming only the still weak collective farmsand state farms, which produce but one-eighth of the amount of grain produced by the kulak farms. 
 To fail to understand the significance of large-scale kulak farmingin the countryside, to fail to understand that the relative importance of the kulaks in the countryside is a hund-red times greater than that of the small capitalists inurban industry, is to lose one’s senses, to break with Leninism, to desert to the side of the enemies of the working class. 
 What, then, is the way out of the situation? 1) The way out lies, above all, in passing from small, backward and scattered peasant farms to united,large socially-conducted farms, equipped with machinery, armed with scientific knowledge and capable of produc-ing the maximum amount of marketable grain. 
 The wayout lies in the transition from individual peasant farming to collective, socially-conducted economy in agriculture. 
 Lenin called on the Party to organise collective farms from the very first days of the October Revolution. 
 From that time onwards the propaganda of the idea ofcollective farming has not ceased in our Party. 
 However, it is only recently that the call for the formation of collective farms has met with a mass response. 
 This isto be explained primarily by the fact that the wide-spread development of a co-operative communal life in the countryside paved the way for a radical changein the attitude of the peasants in favour of collective farms, while the existence of a number of collective farms already harvesting from 150 to 200 poods per dessiatin,of which from 30 to 40 per cent represents a marketable surplus, is strongly attracting the poor peasants and the lower strata of the middle peasants towards the col-lective farms. 
 Of no little importance in this connection is also the fact that only recently has it become possible forthe state to lend substantial financial assistance to the collective-farm movement. 
 We know that this year the state has granted twice the amount of money it didlast year in aid of the collective farms (more than 60,000,000 rubles). 
 The Fifteenth Party Congress was absolutely right in stating that the conditions havealready ripened for a mass collective-farm movement and that the stimulation of the collective-farm movement is one of the most important means of increasing theproportion of marketable grain in the country’s grain production. 
 According to the data of the Central Statistical Board, the gross production of grain by the collective farms in 1927 amounted to no less than 55,000,000 poods, with an average marketable surplus of 30 per cent. 
 The widespread movement at the beginning of this year for the formation of new collective farms and forthe expansion of the old ones should considerably increase the grain output of the collective farms by the end of the year. 
 The task is to maintain the presentrate of development of the collective-farm movement, to enlarge the collective farms, to get rid of sham collec-tive farms, replacing them by genuine ones, and to estab-lish a system whereby the collective farms will deliver to the state and co-operative organisations the whole of their marketable grain under penalty of being deprivedof state subsidies and credits. 
 I think that, if these conditions are adhered to, within three or four years we shall be able to obtain from the collective farms asmuch as 100,000,000 poods of marketable grain. 
 The collective-farm movement is sometimes contrast-ed with the co-operative movement, apparently on theassumption that collective farms are one thing, and co-operatives another. 
 That, of course, is wrong. 
 Some even go so far as to contrast collective farms withLenin’s co-operative plan. 
 Needless to say, such contrast-ing has nothing in common with the truth. 
 In actual fact, the collective farms are a form of co-operatives, themost striking form of producers’ co-operatives. 
 There are marketing co-operatives, there are supply co-opera-tives, and there are also producers’ co-operatives. 
 Thecollective farms are an inseparable and integral part of the co-operative movement in general, and of Lenin’s co-operative plan in particular. 
 To carry out Lenin’sco-operative plan means to raise the peasantry from the level of marketing and supply co-operatives to the level of producers’ co-operatives, of collective-farm co-opera-tives, so to speak. 
 This, by the way, explains why our collective farms began to arise and develop only as aresult of the development and consolidation of the mar-keting and supply co-operatives. 
 2) The way out lies, secondly, in expanding and strengthening the old state farms, and in organising and developing new, large ones. 
 According to the data of the Central Statistical Board, the gross productionof grain in the existing state farms amounted in 1927 to no less than 45,000,000 poods with a marketable sur-plus of 65 per cent. 
 There is no doubt that, given a certainamount of state support, the state farms could consid-erably increase the production of grain. 
 But the task does not end there. 
 There is a deci-sion of the Soviet government on the strength of which new large state farms (from 10,000 to 30,000 dessiatins each) are being organised in districts where there areno peasant holdings; and in five or six years these state farms should yield about 100,000,000 poods of marketable grain. 
 The organisation of these state farms has alreadybegun. 
 The task is to put this decision of the Soviet government into effect at all costs. 
 I think that, provid-ed these tasks are fulfilled, within three or four yearswe shall be able to obtain from the old and new state farms about 80,000,000-100,000,000 poods of grain for the market. 
 3) Finally, the way out lies in systematically in-creasing the yield of the individual small-and middle-peasant farms. 
 We cannot and should not lend any sup-port to the individual large kulak farms. 
 But we can and should assist the individual small-and middle-peas-ant farms, helping them to increase their crop yields and drawing them into the channel of co-operative organ-isation. 
 This is an old task; it was proclaimed withparticular emphasis as early as 1921 when the tax in kind was substituted for the surplus-appropriation sys-tem. 
 This task was reaffirmed by our Party at its Four-teenth 18 and Fifteenth Congresses. 
 The importance of this task is now emphasised by the difficulties on the grain front. 
 That is why this task must be fulfilled withthe same persistence as the first two tasks will be, those concerning the collective farms and the state farms. 
 All the data show that the yield of peasant farms can be increased by some 15 to 20 per cent in the course of a few years. 
 At present no less than 5,000,000 wooden ploughs are in use in our country. 
 Their replacementby modern ploughs alone would result in a very consid-erable increase in grain production in the country. 
 This is apart from supplying the peasant farms with a certainminimum of fertilisers, selected seed, small machines, etc. 
 The contract system, the system of signing contracts with whole villages for supplying them with seed, etc. 
,on condition that in return they unfailingly deliver a certain quantity of grain products—this system is the best method of raising the yield of peasant farms and ofdrawing the peasants into the co-operatives. 
 I think that if we work persistently in this direction we can, within three or four years, obtain additionally from the smalland middle individual peasant farms not less than 100,000,000 poods of marketable grain. 
 Thus, if all these tasks are fulfilled, the state can in three or four years’ time have at its disposal 250,000,000 to 300,000,000 additional poods of marketable grain— a supply more or less sufficient to enable us to manoeu-vre properly within the country as well as abroad. 
 Such, in the main, are the measures which must be taken in order to solve the difficulties on the grain front. 
 Our task at present is to combine these basic meas-ures with current measures to improve planning in the sphere of supplying the countryside with goods, reliev-ing our trading organisations of the duty of supplyinggrain to a number of small and middle-sized towns. 
 Should not, in addition to these measures, a number of other measures be adopted—measures, say, to reducethe rate of development of our industry, the growth of which is causing a considerable increase in the de-mand for grain, which at present is outstripping theincrease in the production of marketable grain? No, not under any circumstances! To reduce the rate of de-velopment of industry would mean to weaken the workingclass; for every step forward in the development of industry, every new factory, every new works, is, as Lenin expressed it, “a new stronghold” of the workingclass, one which strengthens the latter’s position in the fight against the petty-bourgeois elemental forces, in the fight against the capitalist elements in our economy. 
 Onthe contrary, we must maintain the present rate of devel-opment of industry: we must at the first opportunity speed it up in order to pour goods into the rural areasand obtain more grain from them, in order to supply agriculture, and primarily the collective farms and state farms, with machines, in order to industrialise agricultureand to increase the proportion of its output for the market. 
 Should we, perhaps, for the sake of greater “cau-tion,” retard the development of heavy industry so as to make light industry, which produces chiefly for thepeasant market, the basis of our industry? Not un-der any circumstances! That would be suicidal; it would undermine our whole industry, including lightindustry. 
 It would mean abandoning the slogan of in-dustrialising our country, it would mean transforming our country into an appendage of the world capitalistsystem of economy. 
 In this respect we proceed from the well-known guid-ing principles which Lenin set forth at the FourthCongress of the Comintern 19 and which are absolutely binding for the whole of our Party. 
 Here is what Lenin said on this subject at the Fourth Congress of theComintern: “The salvation of Russia lies not only in a good harvest on the peasant farms—that is not enough; and not only in the good condition of light industry, which provides the peasantry with consumer goods—that, too, is not enough; we also need heavy industry. 
” Or again: “We are exercising economy in all things, even in schools. 
 This must be so, because we know that unless we save heavy industry, unless we restore it, we shall not be able to build up any industry; and without that we shall be doomed as an independent country” (V ol. 
 XXVII, p. 
 349). 
 These directives given by Lenin must never be for-gotten. 
 How will the measures proposed affect the alliance between the workers and the peasants? I think that these measures can only help to strengthen the alliance be-tween the workers and the peasants. 
 Indeed, if the collective farms and the state farms develop at increased speed; if, as a result of direct as-sistance given to the small and middle peasants, the yield of their farms increases and the co-operatives em-brace wider and wider masses of the peasantry; if the state obtains the hundreds of millions of poods of addi-tional marketable grain required for manoeuvring; if,as a result of these and similar measures, the kulaks are curbed and gradually overcome—is it not clear that the contradictions between the working class and thepeasantry within the alliance of the workers and peasants will thereby be smoothed out more and more; that the need for emergency measures in the procurement of grainwill disappear; that wide masses of the peasantry will turn more and more to collective forms of farming, and that the fight to overcome the capitalist elements inthe countryside will assume an increasingly mass and organised character? Is it not clear that the cause of the alliance between the workers and the peasants can only benefit by such measures? It must only be borne in mind that the alliance of the workers and peasants under the conditions of the dicta-torship of the proletariat should not be viewed as an ordinary alliance. 
 It is a special form of class alliancebetween the working class and the labouring masses of the peasantry, which sets itself the object: a) of strength-ening the position of the working class; b) of ensuringthe leading role of the working class within this alli-ance; c) of abolishing classes and class society. 
 Any other conception of the alliance of the workers and peasants is opportunism, Menshevism, S. 
-R. 
-ism—anything you like, but not Marxism, not Leninism. 
 How can the idea of the alliance of the workers and peasants be reconciled with Lenin’s well-known thesis that the peasantry is “the last capitalist class”? Is therenot a contradiction here? The contradiction is only an apparent, a seeming one. 
 Actually there is no contradic-tion here at all. 
 In that same speech at the Third Congressof the Comintern 20 in which Lenin characterised the peas-antry as “the last capitalist class,” he again and again substantiates the need for an alliance between the work-ers and the peasants, declaring that “the supreme prin-ciple of the dictatorship is the maintenance of the alliance of the proletariat and the peasantry in order that the pro-letariat may retain its leading role and state power. 
” It is clear that Lenin, at any rate, saw no contradiction in this. 
 How are we to understand Lenin’s thesis that the peasantry is “the last capitalist class”? Does it mean that the peasantry consists of capitalists? No, itdoes not. 
 It means, firstly, that the individual peasantry is a special class, which bases its economy on the pri-vate ownership of the instruments and means of produc-tion and which, for that reason, differs from the class of proletarians, who base their economy on collectiveownership of the instruments and means of production. 
 It means, secondly, that the individual peasantry is a class which produces from its midst, engendersand nourishes, capitalists, kulaks and all kinds of ex-ploiters in general. 
 Is not this circumstance an insuperable obstacle to the organisation of an alliance of the workers and peasants? No, it is not. 
 The alliance of the proletariatwith the peasantry under the conditions of the dictator-ship of the proletariat should not be regarded as an alli-ance with the whole of the peasantry. 
 The alliance ofthe proletariat with the peasantry is an alliance of the working class with the labouring masses of the peasantry. 
 Such an alliance cannot be effected without a struggleagainst the capitalist elements of the peasantry, against the kulaks. 
 Such an alliance cannot be a stable one un-less the poor peasants are organised as the bulwark ofthe working class in the countryside. 
 That is why the alliance between the workers and the peasants under the present conditions of the dictatorship of the prole-tariat can be effected only in accordance with Lenin’s well-known slogan: Rely on the poor peasant, build a stable alliance with the middle peasant, neverfor a moment cease fighting against the kulaks. 
 For only by applying this slogan can the main mass of the peasantry be drawn into the channel of socialistconstruction. 
 You see, therefore, that the contradiction between Lenin’s two formulas is only an imaginary, a seemingcontradiction. 
 Actually, there is no contradiction between them at all.

 127, June 2, 1928 LETTER TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY AFFAIRS STUDY CIRCLE AT THE COMMUNIST ACADEMY Today I received Slepkov’s theses on self-criticism. 
 It appears that they were discussed in your circle. 
 I have been told by members of the circle that these theses were circulated as a document that is intended not to criticisethe line of the Central Committee, but to substantiate it. 
 It would be wrong to deny that Party members have the right to criticise the line of the Central Committee. 
More, I am ready to grant that members of your study circle even have the right to put forward among them-selves their own separate theses opposing the C. 
C. 
’sposition. 
 Slepkov’s theses, however, evidently do not aim at criticising the C. 
C. 
’s line, or putting forward any-thing new in opposition to it, but at explaining and sub-stantiating the position of the C. 
C. 
 It is this, presumably, that explains why Slepkov’s theses received certain currency in Moscow Party circles. 
 Nevertheless, or, rather, for that very reason, I con-sider it my duty to declare that Slepkov’s theses a) do not coincide with the C. 
C. 
’s position on the slogan of self-criticism, and that b) they “correct,” “supplement” and, naturally, wors-en it, to the advantage of the bureaucratic elements inour institutions and organisations. 
 1) Incorrect, in the first place, is the line of Slep-kov’s theses. 
 Slepkov’s theses only superficially resem-ble theses on the slogan of self-criticism. 
 Actually, they are theses on the dangers of the slogan of self-criticism. 
 There is no denying that every revolutionary slogan har-bours certain possibilities of being distorted in practical use. 
 Such possibilities also apply, of course, to the slogan of self-criticism. 
 But to make these possibil-ities the central issue, the basis of theses on self-criti-cism, is to turn things upside down, to undermine the revolutionary significance of self-criticism, to assist thebureaucrats who are trying to evade self-criticism owing to the “dangers” connected with it. 
 I have no doubt that it will not be without a feeling of satisfactionthat the bureaucratic elements in our Party and Soviet organisations will read Slepkov’s theses. 
 Has such a line anything in common with the C. 
C. 
’s line on self-criticism, with the resolution of the April ple-num of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
 on the Shakhty affair, or with the C. 
C. 
’s June appeal on the subject of self-criticism? 21 I think not. 
 2) Incorrect, too, is the inner substance of Slepkov’s theses. 
 One of the most serious factors making self-criti-cism unavoidable, and at the same time one of the most important objects of self-criticism, is the bureaucracy of our organisations. 
 Can we make any progress if we do not combat the bureaucracy of our Party and Soviet apparatus? No, we cannot!Can we organise control by the masses, stimulate the initiative and independent activity of the masses, draw the vast masses into the work of socialist construction,if we do not wage a determined struggle against bureauc-racy in our organisations? No, we cannot! Can we sap, weaken, discredit bureaucracy without giving effect to the slogan of self-criticism? No, we cannot! Is it possible, in theses dealing with the slogan of self-criticism, to evade discussing bureaucracy as a fac-tor detrimental to our socialist construction and as oneof the most important objects of self-criticism? Obviously, we cannot. 
 How, then, is it to be explained that Slepkov con-trived in his theses to say nothing about this burning question? How is it possible, in theses on self-criti-cism that are intended to substantiate the position ofthe C. 
C. 
, to forget the most important task of self-crit-icism—that of combating bureaucracy? Yet it is a fact that in Slepkov’s theses there is not a single word(literally not a single word!) about the bureaucracy of our organisations, about the bureaucratic elements in these organisations, about the bureaucratic perversionsin the work of our Party and Soviet apparatus. 
 Can this more than frivolous attitude towards the highly important question of combating bureaucracy bereconciled with the C. 
C. 
’s position on the question of self-criticism, with such Party documents as the resolu-tion of the April plenum of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
 on theShakhty affair or the C. 
C. 
’s June appeal on self-criticism? I think not.

 90, April 19, 1929 LENIN AND THE QUESTION OF THE ALLIANCE WITH THE MIDDLE PEASANT* Reply to Comrade S. 
 Comrade S. 
, It is not true that Lenin’s slogan: “To come to an agreement with the middle peasant, while never for a mo-ment renouncing the fight against the kulak, and firm-ly relying solely on the poor peasant,” which he advanced in his well-known article on Pitirim Sorokin, 22 is, as is alleged, a slogan of the “period of the Poor Peasants’Committees,” a slogan of “the end of the period of the so-called neutralisation of the middle peasantry. 
” That is absolutely untrue . 
 The Poor Peasants’ Committees were formed in June 1918. 
 By the end of October 1918, our forces in the countryside had already gained the upper hand over thekulaks, and the middle peasants had turned to the side of the Soviet power. 
 It was on the basis of this turn that the decision of the Central Committee was taken to abol-ish the dual power of the Soviets and the Poor Peas-ants’ Committees, to hold new elections to the volost and village Soviets, to merge the Poor Peasants’ Commit-tees with the newly-elected Soviets and, consequently, to dissolve the Poor Peasants’ Committees. 
 This decision was formally approved, as is well known, on November 9, * Slightly abridged. 
— J. 
 St. 
 1918, by the Sixth Congress of Soviets. 
 I have in mind the decision of the Sixth Congress of Soviets of Novem-ber 9, 1918, on the village and volost Soviet electionsand the merging of the Poor Peasants’ Committees with the Soviets. 
 But when did Lenin’s article, “The Valuable Admissions of Pitirim Sorokin,” appear, the article in which he pro-claimed the slogan of agreement with the middle peasant in the place of the slogan of neutralising the middle peas-ant? It appeared on November 21, 1918, i. 
e. 
, nearly two weeks after the decision of the Sixth Congress of So-viets. 
 In this article Lenin plainly says that the policyof agreement with the middle peasant is dictated by the turn to our side made by the middle peasant. 
 Here is what Lenin says: “Our task in the countryside is to destroy the landlord and smash the resistance of the exploiter and the kulak speculator. 
 For this purpose we can rely firmly only on the semi-proletarians, the ‘poor peasants. 
’ But the middle peasant is not our enemy. 
 Hevacillated, is vacillating and will continue to vacillate. 
 Thetask of influencing the vacillators is not identical with the task of overthrowing the exploiter and defeating the active enemy. 
The task at the present moment is to come to an agreement with the middle peasant, while never for a moment renounc-ing the fight against the kulak, and firmly relying solely onthe poor peasant, for it is precisely now that a turn in our direction on the part of the middle peasantry is inevitable ,* owing to the causes above enumerated” (V ol. 
 XXIII, p. 
 294). 
 What follows from this? It follows from this that Lenin’s slogan refers, not to the old period, not to the period of the Poor Peasants’ Committees and the neutralisation of the middle peasant, * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 but to the new period, the period of agreement with the middle peasant. 
 Thus, it reflects, not the end of the old period, but the beginning of a new period. 
 But your assertion about Lenin’s slogan is not only wrong from the formal point of view, not merely, so to speak, chronologically; it is wrong in substance. 
 We know that Lenin’s slogan regarding agreement with the middle peasant was proclaimed as a new slogan by the whole Party at the Eighth Party Congress (March1919). 
 We know that the Eighth Party Congress was the congress which laid the foundation of our policy of a stable alliance with the middle peasant. 
 It is knownthat our programme, the programme of the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) was adopted also at the Eighth Congress of the Party. 
 We know that that programme contains special pointsdealing with the Party’s attitude towards the various groups in the countryside: the poor peasants, the middle peasants, and the kulaks. 
 What do these points in theprogramme of the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) say regarding the social groups in the countryside and regarding our Party’s at-titude towards them? Listen: “In all its work in the countryside the R. 
C. 
P. 
, as hitherto, relies on the proletarian and semi-proletarian strata of the rural popula-tion; first and foremost it organises these strata into an independent force by establishing Party units in the villages, forming organ-isations of poor peasants, a special type of trade unions of pro-letarians and semi-proletarians in the country side, and so forth, bringing them closer in every way to the urban proletariat andwresting them from the influence of the rural bourgeoisie and the small proprietor interests. 
 “With respect to the kulaks, to the rural bourgeoisie, the policy of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 is resolutely to combat their exploiting procliv-ities, to suppress their resistance to the Soviet policy . 
 “With respect to the middle peasants, the policy of the R. 
C. 
P. 
 is gradually and systematically to draw them into the work of socialist construction. 
 The Party sets itself the task of separating them from the kulaks, of winning them to the side ofthe working class by carefully attending to their needs, of com-bating their backwardness by measures of ideological influence and not at all by measures of repression, and of striving in allcases where their vital interests are concerned to come to practi-cal agreements with them , making concessions to them in determin-ing the methods of carrying out socialist changes”* ( Eighth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P . 
(B. 
) , verbatim report, p. 
 351 23). 
 Try to find the slightest difference even in words be-tween these points of the programme and Lenin’s slogan! You will not find any difference, for there is none. 
 More than that. 
 There cannot be any doubt that Lenin’s slo-gan not only does not contradict the decisions of the Eighth Congress on the middle peasant, but, on the contrary, is a most apt and exact formulation of these decisions. 
And it is a fact that the programme of the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) was adopted in March 1919, at the Eighth Congress of the Party, which specially discussed the question of themiddle peasant, while Lenin’s article against Pitirim Sorokin, which proclaimed the slogan of agreement with the middle peasant, appeared in the press in November1918, four months before the Eighth Congress of the Party. 
 Is it not clear that the Eighth Congress of the Party fully and entirely confirmed Lenin’s slogan, proclaimed by him in his article against Pitirim Sorokin, as a slogan by which the Party must be guided in its work in the countryside during the whole of the present period of so-cialist construction ? * All italics mine. 
— J. 
 St. 
 What is the essential point of Lenin’s slogan? The essential point of Lenin’s slogan is that it em-braces with remarkable precision the triune task of Party work in the countryside, expressed in a single condensed formula: a) rely on the poor peasant, b) establish agree-ment with the middle peasant, and c) never for a moment cease fighting against the kulaks. 
 Try to take from this formula any one of its parts as a basis for work in the countryside at the present time and forget about theother parts, and you will inevitably find yourself in a blind alley. 
 Is it possible in the present phase of socialist con-struction to reach a real and stable agreement with the middle peasant without relying on the poor peasant and without waging a fight against the kulak? It is not possible. 
 Is it possible, under the present conditions of devel-opment, to wage a successful fight against the ku-lak without relying on the poor peasant and without reaching agreement with the middle peasant? It is not possible. 
How can this triune task of Party work in the coun-tryside be most aptly expressed in one all-embracing slogan? I think that Lenin’s slogan is the most apt ex-pression of this task. 
 It must be admitted that you can-not express it more aptly than Lenin. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Why is it necessary to emphasise the expediency of Lenin’s slogan just now , precisely under the present condi-tions of work in the countryside? Because just now we see a tendency among certain comrades to break up this triune task of Party work in the countryside into parts and to sever these parts from one another. 
 This is fully borne out by the expe-rience of our grain-procurement campaign in January and February of this year. 
 Every Bolshevik knows that agreement must be reached with the middle peasant. 
 But not everybody understands how this agreement is to be reached. 
 Somethink that agreement with the middle peasant can be brought about by abandoning the fight against the kulak, or by slackening this fight; because, they say,the fight against the kulak may frighten away a section of the middle peasantry, its well-to-do section. 
 Others think that agreement with the middle peas-ant can be brought about by abandoning the work of organising the poor peasants, or by slackening this work; because, they say, the organisation of the poorpeasants means singling out the poor peasants, and this may frighten the middle peasants away from us. 
 The result of these deviations from the correct line is that such people forget the Marxist thesis that the middle peasantry is a vacillating class, that agreement with the middle peasants can be rendered stable only ifa determined fight is carried on against the kulaks and if the work among the poor peasants is intensified; that unless these conditions are adhered to, the middle peas-antry may swing to the side of the kulaks, as to a force. 
 Remember what Lenin said at the Eighth Party Congress: “We have to determine our attitude to a class which has no definite and stable position . 
* The proletariat in its mass is in favour of socialism, the bourgeoisie in its mass is opposed to socialism; * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 to determine the relation between these two classes is easy. 
 But when we pass to a stratum like the middle peasantry we find that it is a class that vacillates . 
 The middle peasant is partly a property owner, partly a toiler. 
 He does not exploit other representatives of the toilers. 
 For decades he had to defend his position under the greatest difficulties; he suffered the exploitation of the land-lords and the capitalists; he bore everything and yet at the same time he is a property owner. 
 Our attitude to this vacillating class therefore presents enormous difficulties” ( Eighth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P . 
(B. 
) , verbatim report, p. 
 30024). 
 But there are other deviations from the correct line, no less dangerous than those already mentioned. 
 In some cases the fight against the kulak is indeed car-ried on, but it is carried on in such a clumsy and sense-less manner that the blows fall on the middle and poor peasants. 
 As a result, the kulak escapes unscathed,a rift is made in the alliance with the middle peasant, and a section of the poor peasants temporarily falls into the clutches of the kulak, who is fighting to under-mine Soviet policy. 
 In other cases attempts are made to transform the fight against the kulaks into dekulakisation, and thework of grain procurement into appropriation of sur-pluses, forgetting that under present conditions deku-lakisation is folly and the surplus-appropriation systemmeans not an alliance with, but a fight against, the middle peasant. 
 What is the source of these deviations from the Party line? The source lies in failure to understand that the triple task of Party work in the countryside is a single and indivisible task; in failure to understand that the task of fighting the kulak cannot be separated from the task of reaching agreement with the middle peasant, and that these two tasks cannot be separated from the task of converting the poor peasant into a bulwark of the Party in the countryside. 
* What must be done to ensure that these tasks are not separated from one another in the course of our current work in the countryside? We must, at least, issue a guiding slogan that will combine all these tasks in one general formula and, consequently, prevent these tasks from being separatedfrom one another. 
 Is there such a formula, such a slogan in our Party arsenal? Yes, there is. 
 That formula is Lenin’s slogan: “To come to an agreement with the middle peasant, while * From this it follows that deviations from the correct line create a twofold danger to the alliance of the workers and peas-ants: a danger from the side of those who want, for instance, to transform the temporary emergency measures for grain pro-curement into a permanent or long-term policy of the Party; and a danger from the side of those who want to take advantage of the discontinuance of emergency measures in order to give the kulak a free hand, to proclaim complete freedom of trade, without any regulation of trade by state bodies. 
 Hence, in order to ensure that the correct line is pursued the fight must be waged on two fronts. 
 I take this opportunity to observe that our press does not always follow this rule and sometimes displays a certain one-sidedness. 
 In some cases, for instance, the press exposes those who want to transform the emergency measures for grain pro-curement which are of a temporary character, into a permanent line of our policy and who thus endanger the bond with the peas-ants. 
 That is very good. 
 But it is bad and wrong if at the same time our press fails to pay sufficient attention to and properly never for a moment renouncing the fight against the kulak, and firmly rely ing solely on the poor peasant. 
” That is why I think that this slogan is the most expedient and all-embracing slogan, that it must bebrought to the forefront just now , precisely under the present conditions of our work in the countryside. 
 You regard Lenin’s slogan as an “oppositionist” slogan and in your letter you ask: “ How is it that . 
 . 
 . 
 this oppo-sitionist slogan was printed in Pravda for May 1 , 1928 . 
 . 
 . 
 how can the fact be explained that this slogan appeared on the pages of Pravda , the organ of the Central Committee of the C. 
P . 
S. 
U. 
—is this merely a technical oversight , or is it a compromise with the opposition on the questionof the middle peasant? ” expose those who endanger the bond from the other side, who succumb to the petty-bourgeois elemental forces, demand a slack-ening of the fight against the capitalist elements in the coun-tryside and the establishment of complete freedom of trade, trade not regulated by the state, and thus undermine the bond with the peasants from the other end. 
 That is bad. 
 That is one-sided-ness. 
 It also happens that the press exposes those who, for instance, deny the possibility and expediency of improving the individual small-and middle-peasant farms, which at the present stage are the basis of agriculture. 
 That is very good. 
 But it is bad and wrong if at the same time the press does not expose those who belittle the importance of the collective farms and the state farms and who fail to see that the task of improving individual small-and middle-peasant farms must be supplemented in practice by the task of expanding the construction of collective and state farms. 
 That is one-sidedness. 
 In order to ensure that the correct line is pursued, the fight must be waged on two fronts , and all one-sidedness must be re-jected. 
 That is very strongly put—there’s no denying! But “watch your step,” Comrade S. 
; otherwise you may, in your zeal, arrive at the conclusion that we mustprohibit the printing of our programme, which fully confirms Lenin’s slogan (this is a fact!), and which in the main was drawn up by Lenin (who was cer-tainly not an oppositionist!), and which was adopted by the Eighth Congress of the Party (also not oppositionist!). 
 Have more respect for the well-knownpoints in our programme on the social groups in the countryside! Have more respect for the decisions of the Eighth Party Congress on the middle peas-antry! . 
 . 
 . 
 As for your phrase “a compromise with the opposi-tion on the question of the middle peasant,” I do notthink it is worth refuting it; no doubt you wrote it in the heat of the moment. 
 You seem to be disturbed by the fact that both Lenin’s slogan and the Programme of the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) adopted by the Eighth Congress of the Party speak of agreement with the middle peasant, whereas in his speech in opening the Eighth Congress Lenin spoke of a stable alliance with the middle peasant. 
 Evidently, you think there is something in the nature of a contradictionin this. 
 Perhaps you are even inclined to believe that the policy of agreement with the middle peasant is some-thing in the nature of a departure from the policy ofalliance with the middle peasant. 
 That is wrong, Com-rade S. 
 That is a serious misconception. 
 Only those who are able to read the letter of a slogan, but are unable tograsp its meaning, can think like that. 
 Only those who are ignorant of the history of the slogan of alliance, of agreement with the middle peasant, can think like that. 
 Only those can think like that who are capable of believing that Lenin, who in his opening speech atthe Eighth Congress spoke about the policy of a “stable alliance” with the middle peasant, departed from his own position by saying in another speech at the same congress, and in the Party programme adopted by the Eighth Congress, that we now need a policy of “agree-ment” with the middle peasant. 
 What is the point then? The point is that both Lenin and the Party, in the shape of the Eighth Congress, make no distinction whatever between the concept “agreement” and the concept “alliance. 
” The point is that everywhere, in all his speeches at the Eighth Congress, Lenin places a sign of equality between the concept “alliance” and the concept “agreement. 
” The same must be said about the resolution of the Eighth Congress, “The Attitude to the Middle Peasantry,” in which a sign of equality is placed between the concept “agreement” and the concept “alliance. 
” And since Lenin and the Party regard the policy of agreement with the middle peasantnot as a casual and transient one, but as a long-term policy, they had, and have, every reason to call the policy of agreement with the middle peasant a policyof stable alliance with him and, conversely, to call the policy of stable alliance with the middle peasant a policy of agreement with him. 
 One has only to readthe verbatim report of the Eighth Congress of the Party and the resolution of that congress on the middle peas-ant to be convinced of this. 
 Here is an excerpt from Lenin’s speech at the Eighth Congress: “Owing to the inexperience of Soviet officials and to the difficulties of the problem, the blows which were intended for the kulaks very frequently fell on the middle peasantry. 
 Here we have sinned exceedingly. 
 The experience we have gained inthis respect will enable us to do everything to avoid this in the future. 
 That is the task now facing us, not theoretically, but practically. 
 You know very well that this task is a difficult one. 
We have no material advantages to offer the middle peasant; and he is a materialist, a practical man who demands definite, material advantages, which we are not now in a position to offerand which the country will have to do without, perhaps, for sev-eral months yet of severe struggle—a struggle which now prom-ises to end in complete victory. 
 But there is a great deal wecan do in our administrative work: we can improve our admi-nistrative apparatus and correct a host of abuses. 
 The line of our Party, which has not done enough towards arriving at a bloc , an alliance , an agreement * with the middle peasantry, can and must be straightened out and corrected” ( Eighth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P . 
(B. 
) , verbatim report, p. 
 20 25). 
 As you see, Lenin makes no distinction between “agreement” and “alliance. 
” And here are excerpts from the resolution of the Eighth Congress, “The Attitude to the Middle Peas-antry”: “To confuse the middle peasants with the kulaks, to extend to them, to any degree, the measures that are directed against thekulaks, means most grossly to violate, not only all Soviet decrees and all Soviet policy, but also all the fundamental principles of communism, which point to agreement between the proletariat and the middle peasantry during the period of the resolute struggle of the proletariat for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie as one of the conditions for the painless transition to the abolition of allforms of exploitation.

 “The middle peasantry, which possesses comparatively strong economic roots owing to the backwardness of agricultural tech-nique, compared with industrial technique, even in the advanced capitalist countries, let alone Russia, will continue to existfor a fairly long time after the beginning of the proletarian revo-lution. 
 That is why the tactics of Soviet officials in the country-side, as well as of active Party workers, must be based on theassumption of a long period of collaboration with the middle peasantry. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 “. 
 . 
 . 
 An absolutely correct policy pursued by the Soviet government in the countryside thus ensures alliance and agree-ment between the victorious proletariat and the middle peas-antry. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 “. 
 . 
 . 
 The policy of the workers’ and peasants’ government and of the Communist Party must continue to be conducted in this spirit of agreement between the proletariat, together with the poor peasantry, and the middle peasantry”* ( Eighth Congress of the R. 
C. 
P . 
(B. 
) , verbatim report, pp. 
 370-7226). 
 As you see, the resolution also makes no distinction between “agreement” and “alliance. 
” It will not be superfluous to observe that there is not a single word in this resolution of the Eighth Con-gress about a “stable alliance” with the middle peasant. 
 Does that mean, however, that the resolution thereby departs from the policy of a “stable alliance” with the middle peasant? No, it does not. 
 It only means that the resolution places a sign of equality between the con-cept “agreement,” “collaboration,” and the concept“stable alliance. 
” For it is clear: there cannot be an “alliance” with the middle peasant without an “agree-ment” with him, and the alliance with the middle peas-ant cannot be “stable” unless there is “a long period” of agreement and collaboration with him. 
 * All italics mine. 
— J. 
 St. 
 Such are the facts. 
 Either one or the other: either Lenin and the Eighth Congress of the Party departed from Lenin’s statement about a “stable alliance” with the middle peasant, or this frivolous assumption must be abandoned and it must be admitted that Lenin and the Eighth Con-gress of the Party made no distinction whatever between the concept “agreement” and the concept “stable al-liance. 
” Thus, one who refuses to be a victim of idle pedantry, one who desires to grasp the true meaning of Lenin’s slogan, which speaks of relying on the poor peasantry,of agreement with the middle peasantry and of fighting the kulaks, cannot fail to understand that the policy of agreement with the middle peasant is a policy of stable alliance with him. 
 Your mistake is that you have failed to understand the fraudulent trick of the opposition and have fallena prey to their provocation; you walked into the trap the enemy set for you. 
 The oppositionist swindlers noisily assure us that they are in favour of Lenin’s slogan ofagreement with the middle peasant, but at the same time they drop the provocatory hint that “agreement” with the middle peasant is one thing and a “stable alliance”with him is something different. 
 In this way they want to kill two birds with one stone: firstly, to conceal their real attitude to the middle peasantry, which is not oneof agreement with the middle peasant, but of “ dissen-sion with the middle peasant” (see the well-known speech of the oppositionist Smirnov, which I quotedat the Sixteenth Moscow Gubernia Party Conference 27); and, secondly, to catch the simpletons among the Bol-sheviks with the alleged difference between “agreement” and “alliance,” and muddle them up completely, by driving them away from Lenin. 
 And how do certain of our comrades react to this? Instead of tearing the mask from the oppositionist trick-sters, instead of convicting them of deceiving the Partyabout their true position, they swallow the bait, walk into the trap, and allow themselves to be driven away from Lenin. 
 The opposition is making a lot of noiseabout Lenin’s slogan; the oppositionists are posing as adherents of Lenin’s slogan; therefore, I must dissociate myself from this slogan, otherwise I may be confusedwith the opposition, otherwise I may be accused of “compromising with the opposition”—such is the logic of these comrades! And this is not the only instance of the fraudulent tricks played by the opposition. 
 Take, for instance, the slogan of self-criticism. 
 Bolsheviks cannot but knowthat the slogan of self-criticism is one of the founda-tions of our Party activities: it is a means of strengthen-ing the proletarian dictatorship, the soul of the Bolshe-vik method of training cadres. 
 The opposition makes a lot of noise, asserting that it, the opposition, invented the slogan of self-criticism, that the Party stole thisslogan from it, and thereby capitulated to the opposi-tion. 
 By acting in this way the opposition is trying to gain at least two ends: firstly, to deceive the working class and to conceal from it the fact that an abyss divides the opposition’s “self-criticism,” the purpose of which is to destroy th e Party spirit, from Bolshevik self-criticism, the purpose of which is to strengthen the Party spirit; secondly, to catch certain simpletons and to induce them to dissociate themselves from the Party slogan of self-criticism. 
 And how do some of our comrades react to this? Instead of tearing the mask from the oppositionist trick-sters and upholding the slogan of Bolshevik self-criticism,they walk into the trap, dissociate themselves from the slogan of self-criticism, dance to the tune of the oppo-sition and . 
 . 
 . 
 capitulate to it, in the mistaken beliefthat they are dissociating themselves from the oppo-sition. 
 A host of such instances could be quoted,But in our work we cannot dance to anybody’s tune. 
 Still less can we be guided in our work by what the oppositionists say about us. 
 We must pursue ourown path, brushing, aside both the fraudulent tricks of the opposition and the errors of certain of our Bol-sheviks who fall victims to the provocation of the oppo-sitionists.

 That is precisely the way the Fifteenth Congressof our Party understood it, in saying in its resolution on the report of the Central Committee: “The contra-dictions between the countries of the bourgeois encircle-ment and the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
, whose victorious development is undermining the foundations of world capitalism, have grown more acute. 
 The chief factors contributingto this increasing acuteness are the growth of the social-ist elements in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
, the collapse of the hopes of the bourgeoisie that the proletarian dictatorship would degenerate , coupled with the increasing international and revolutionary influence of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
”*29 We know that the Party elaborated this standpoint not casually and incidentally, but in the course of a des-perate struggle against the opposition, who openly assert-ed that the reason for the offensive of imperialismagainst the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 was the weakening of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 owing to its being in process of degeneration . 
 Frumkin, however, fundamentally disagrees with the standpoint of the Party. 
 He asserts that, on the con-trary, “the basic and decisive factor determining the offensive of the capitalist world against the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
is that we are growing weaker , politically and economi-cally. 
” What can there be in common between these two opposite estimates, one of which emanates from Frum-kin and the other from the Fifteenth Congress of our Party? 2. 
 Even more incorrect is Frumkin’s estimate of the internal situation in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 Reading Frumkin’s letter, one might think that the Soviet regime is on itslast legs, that the country is on the verge of the abyss and that the downfall of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 is a matter of only a few months, if not of a few days. 
 The only thinghe omitted to say is that we have “sung our swan song. 
” We are accustomed to hearing the wailing of intel-lectuals about the “doom” of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 coming from the lips of the oppositionists. 
 But is it seemly for Frumkin to follow the example of the opposition? * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 It would be incorrect, of course, to underestimate the importance of our difficulties. 
 But it would be even more incorrect to overestimate their importance, tolose our balance and succumb to panic. 
 Undoubtedly, the kulak is furious with the Soviet Government: it would be strange to expect him to be friendly towards it. 
Undoubtedly, the kulak has an influence on a certain section of the poor and middle peasants. 
 But to con-clude from this that the sentiment of the majority ofthe poor and middle peasants is against the Soviet Gov-ernment, that “this sentiment is already beginning to spread to the working-class centres ,” is to lose one’s head and succumb to panic. 
 It is with truth that the proverb says: “Fear has big eyes. 
” One can imagine in what a state Frumkin would be if we had today not our present, but more serious difficulties—a war, say, when vacillations of every kind would have a wide “field of action. 
” 3. 
 Frumkin is absolutely wrong when he states that “the deterioration in our economic position has grown sharper owing to the new political line in relation to the countryside after the Fifteenth Congress. 
” This evi-dently refers to the measures taken by the Party at the beginning of this year to improve grain procurements. 
Frumkin regards these measures as harmful , as having caused a “deterioration” in our position. 
 It follows that the April plenum of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
 was wrong when it established that a) “the grain procurement difficulties were connected with the difficulties arising from the swift rate of indus-trialisation of the country dictated to the proletarian state by the entire international and internal situation, and with the errors committed in the planned direction of the economy ,” that b) “the aggravation of the disproportion in market relations (between rural effective demand on the one hand, and the supply of manufactured goods on the other) is due to the increased incomes of the rural popula-tion, and especially of its well-to-do and kulak sections” (and not to the Party’s measures— J. 
 St. 
 ), and that c) “the difficulties were aggravated and complicated by the endeavour of the kulak section of the rural population and the speculators to take advantage of them in order to force up grain prices and to disrupt the Soviet pricepolicy”* (and not by the Party’s measures— J. 
 St. 
 ). 
 It follows that the April plenum of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
 was wrong when it declared in its resolution on grain procurements that “the above-mentioned meas-ures of the Party , which were in part of an emergency character, ensured very great successes in increasing grain procurements. 
”* 30 It follows, then, that Frumkin is right , and the April plenum of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
 is wrong ! Who, after all, is right—Frumkin or the plenum of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
? Let us turn to the facts. 
What was the position at the beginning of January of this year? We had a deficit of 128,000,000 poods of grain as compared with last year. 
 How were the procurements being carried out at that time? By letting them proceed of their own accord, without any emergency measures being taken by the * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 Party, without any active interference by the Party in the procurements. 
 What resulted from letting things go of their own accord and not exerting any pressure? A deficit of 128,000,000 poods of grain. 
 What would the results be now if the Party had fol-lowed Frumkin’s advice and had not interfered, if the deficit of 128,000,000 poods of grain had not been made good before the spring, before the spring sowing ? Our work-ers would now be going hungry, there would be hunger in the industrial centres, a break-down of our construc-tive work, hunger in the Red Army. 
 Could the Party refrain from interfering and not go to the length of applying emergency measures? Obvi-ously, it could not have acted otherwise than it did. 
 What follows from this? It follows that our entire national economy would now be in a most dangerous crisis if we had not interfered in the matter of grainprocurements in good time . 
 There can be only one conclusion, and that is that Frumkin is absolutely wrong in coming out against th e decisions of the April plenum of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
 and in demanding their revision . 
 4. 
 Frumkin is absolutely wrong when he says: “We must return to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Party Con-gresses. 
” We have no need to return to the Fifteenth Congress, for the Party stands fully and entirely by thedecisions of the Fifteenth Congress. 
 But Frumkin de-mands a return to the Fourteenth Congress. 
 What does that mean? Does it not mean obliterating the whole path we have travelled and going backward instead of forward? The Fifteenth Party Congress says in its resolution on “Work in the Countryside” that, in the interest of social-ist development in the countryside, we must wage a“more resolute offensive against the kulak . 
” 31 The Four-teenth Party Congress did not say this, and could not have said it in the conditions of that time. 
 What, in thatcase, can Frumkin’s demand for a “return to the Four-teenth Congress” mean? It can mean only one thing, namely, renunciation of the policy of a “more resoluteoffensive against the kulak. 
” It follows that Frumkin’s demand that we return to the Fourteenth Congress would lead to renunciation of the decisions of the Fifteenth Party Congress. 
 The Fifteenth Party Congress says in its resolution on “Work in the Countryside” that “in the present pe-riod, the task of uniting and transforming the small individual peasant farms into large collective farms must be made the Party’s principal task in the countryside. 
” 32 The Fourteenth Party Congress did not say this, and could not have said it in the conditions of that time. 
 It could be said only by the time of theFifteenth Congress, when, parallel with the old and unquestionably obligatory task of developing individ-ual small-and middle-peasant farming, we were facedwith the new practical task of developing collective farms , as farms producing large marketable surpluses. 
 What, in that case, can be meant by Frumkin’s demand for a “return to the Fourteenth Congress”? It can mean only one thing: renunciation of the new practical task of developing collective farms. 
 This, indeed, explains the fact that for the practical task of developing collective farms, Frumkin substitutes the artful task of rendering “maximum assistance to the poor peasants entering collectives. 
” It follows, therefore, that Frumkin’s demand for a return to the Fourteenth Congress would lead to re-nunciation of the decisions of the Fifteenth Congress. 
 The Fifteenth Party Congress says in its resolution on “Directives for Drafting a Five-Year Plan for the National Economy” that “it is necessary at the present time to give greater support to all viable forms ofproducers ’ co-operatives (communes, collective farms, artels, producers’ co-operatives, co-operative factories, etc. 
), as well as to state farms, which must be raised to a higher level . 
”* 33 The Fourteenth Party Congress did not say this, and could not have said it in the condi-tions of that time. 
 It could be said only by the time ofthe Fifteenth Congress, when, parallel with the tasks of developing individual small-and middle-peasant farming on the one hand, and of developing collectivefarms on the other, we were faced with another new practical task, the task of developing state farms , as units producing the largest marketable surpluses. 
 What, in that case, can be meant by Frumkin’s demand for a “return to the Fourteenth Congress”? It can mean only one thing: renunciation of the policyof “raising the state farms to a higher level. 
” This, indeed, explains why for the positive task of developing state farms, as laid down by the Fifteenth Congress,Frumkin substitutes a negative task, namely, that “state farms should not be expanded by shock or super-shock tactics,” although Frumkin cannot help knowing that * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR here the Party is not setting itself, and cannot set itself, any “super-shock” tasks, because we are only just beginning seriously to approach the question of organis-ing new state farms. 
 Again it follows that Frumkin’s demand for a return to the Fourteenth Congress leads to renunciation of the decisions of the Fifteenth Congress. 
 In view of all this, what value can be attached to Frumkin’s assertion that the C. 
C. 
 has “departed” fromthe decisions of the Fifteenth Congress? Would it not be truer to say that Frumkin’s whole letter is a badly camouflaged attempt to nullify the Fifteenth Con-gress decisions on a number of highly important ques-tions? Is it not this that explains Frumkin’s assertion that the resolution of the April plenum of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
 on grain procurements is “ half-hearted and ambiguous ”? Would it not be truer to say that the resolution of theplenum is correct, and that it is Frumkin himself who is beginning to see things “ambiguously” because of a certain “half-heartedness” in his position? Frumkin’s basic mistake is that he sees only one task, that of stimulating individual peasant farming, believ-ing that our attitude towards agriculture is in the mainrestricted to this. 
 His mistake is that he does not understand the new thing that the Party gave us at its Fifteenth Congress;he does not understand that we cannot now restrict our-selves to the one task of stimulating individual peasant farming, that this task must be supplemented by two new practical tasks: that of developing state farms and that of developing collective farms. 
 Frumkin does not understand that if the first task is not combined with the two others, we shall not be able to make good either in the matter of supplying thestate with marketable grain, or in the matter of organ-ising the entire national economy on socialist lines. 
 Does this mean that we are already laying the prin-cipal stress on the state farms and collective farms? No, it does not. 
 At the present stage, the principal stress must still be laid on raising the level of individual small-and middle-peasant farming. 
 But it does mean that this task alone is no longer enough . 
 It means that the time has come when this task must be practically supple-mented by two new tasks—the development of collective farms and the development of state farms. 
 5. 
 Absolutely incorrect is Frumkin’s remark that “the outlawing of the kulak has led to lawless actions against the entire peasantry. 
” In the first place, it is not true that the kulak has been “outlawed. 
” In the second place, if there is any meaning at all in Frumkin’s words, it can only be that he is demandingthat the Party should restore “rights of citizenship” to the kulak, should restore political rights to the kulak (the right, say, to take part in elections to the Soviets,etc. 
). 
 Does Frumkin think that the Party and the Soviet Government would gain by abolishing the restrictionson the kulaks? How can Frumkin’s “state of mind” be reconciled with the Fifteenth Congress decision to wage a “more resolute offensive against the kulak”? Does Frumkin think that weakening the fight against the kulak will strengthen our alliance with the middle peasant? Does it not occur to Frumkin that res-toration of rights to the kulak would only facilitate the latter’s efforts to sever the middle peasant from us? In view of all this, what value can be attached to Frumkin’s talk about alliance with the middle peasant? Of course, it would be wrong to deny the infringe-ment of laws by some of our officials in the countryside. 
 It would be still more wrong to deny that, because of the clumsy way some of our officials are waging thefight against the kulak, blows intended for the kulak sometimes fall on the heads of the middle peasants, and even of the poor peasants. 
 Unquestionably, a mostresolute struggle is necessary against such distortions of the Party line. 
 But how can it be concluded from this that the fight against the kulak must be relaxed,that restriction of the kulak’s political rights must be renounced, and so on? 6. 
 Frumkin is right when he says that you cannot fight the kulaks by means of dekulakisation, as certain of our local officials are doing. 
 But he is mistaken if he thinks that he has said anything new by this. 
 Toblame Comrade Molotov or Comrade Kubyak for these distortions, as Frumkin does, and to assert that the Party is not combating such distortions, is to committhe gravest injustice and to be guilty of unpardonable bad temper. 
 7. 
 Frumkin is right when he says that we must open peasant markets, the grain market. 
 But be is mistaken if he thinks that he has said anything new by this. 
 In the first place, the Party never was in favour of closing thepeasant markets. 
 In the second place, Frumkin cannot help knowing that, since closing of peasant markets did take place in certain districts, the centre promptly ordered the local organisations to reopen them immediately and to put a stop to such distortions. 
 We know that thisdecision of the centre was circulated to the localities already towards the end of May (May 26), that is, two weeks before the appearance of Frumkin’s letter. 
 Frum-kin could not help knowing this. 
 Was it then worth while “knocking at an open door”? 8. 
 Frumkin is right when he says that grain prices must be raised and that the fight against illicit distil-ling must be intensified. 
 But, again, it would be strange to think that Frumkin has made some new discovery. 
The fight against illicit distilling has been going on since January of this year. 
 It must and will be inten-sified, although Frumkin cannot but know that it willcause discontent in the countryside. 
 As to raising grain prices, Frumkin cannot but know that a decision to raise grain prices at the beginning of the next procure-ment year was taken by the Political Bureau in February of this year, that is, four months before the appearance of Frumkin’s letter. 
 Once again: was it worth while“knocking at an open door” with regard to raising prices? 9. 
 At first glance it might appear that Frumkin’s letter was composed with a view to defending the alli-ance with the middle peasant. 
 But that is only an ap-pearance. 
 Actually, Frumkin’s letter is a plea on behalfof making things easier for the kulak, a plea on behalf of abolishing the restrictions on the kulak. 
 No one who desires to strengthen the alliance with the middle peas-ant can demand that the struggle against the kulak should be relaxed. 
 To ensure a stable alliance with the middle peasant is a most important task of our Party. 
 But such an al-liance can be ensured only if a resolute fight is wagedagainst the kulak, only if the poor peasant is made the bulwark of the proletariat in the countryside, and, finally, only if we are ready and able to come to a lasting agree-ment with the middle peasant, one capable of reinforcing the alliance with him and strengthening the position of the proletariat in the struggle for socialist construc-tion. 
 Our policy in this field must aim not at a relaxation of the struggle against the capitalist elements in the coun-tryside, but at “ agreement between the proletariat and the middle peasantry,” at “ a long period of collaboration with the middle peasantry,” at “ alliance and agreement be-tween the victorious proletariat and the middle peasantry” (see the resolution of the Eighth Party Congress on “The Attitude to the Middle Peasantry”). 
 34 J. 
 Stalin June 20, 1918 Published for the first time AGAINST VULGARISING THE SLOGAN OF SELF-CRITICISM The slogan of self-criticism must not be regarded as something temporary and transient. 
 Self-criticismis a specific method, a Bolshevik method, of training the forces of the Party and of the working class generally in the spirit of revolutionary development. 
 Marx him-self spoke of self-criticism as a method of strengthening the proletarian revolution. 
 35 As to self-criticism in our Party, its beginnings date back to the first appearanceof Bolshevism in our country, to its very inception as a specific revolutionary trend in the working-class movement. 
 We know that as early as the spring of 1904, when Bolshevism was not yet an independent political party but worked together with the Mensheviks within a sin-gle Social-Democratic party—we know that Lenin was already calling upon the Party to undertake “self-crit-icism and ruthless exposure of its own shortcomings. 
”Here is what Lenin wrote in his pamphlet One Step Forward, Two Steps Back : “They (i. 
e. 
, the opponents of the Marxists— J. 
 St. 
 ) gloat and grimace over our controversies; and, of course, they will try to pick isolated passages from my pamphlet, which deals with the defects and shortcomings of our Party, and to use them for their own ends. 
 The Russian Social-Democrats are already steeled enough in battle not to be perturbed by these pin-pricks and to continue, in spite of them, their work of self-criticism and ruthless exposure of their own shortcomings ,* which will unquestion-ably and inevitably be overcome as the working-class movement grows. 
 As for those gentlemen, our opponents, let them try to give us a picture of the true state of affairs in their own ‘parties’ even remotely approximating that given by the minutes of our Second Congress!” (Vol. 
 VI, p. 
 161. 
36) Therefore, those comrades are absolutely wrong who think that self-criticism is a passing phenomenon, a fashion which is bound speedily to go out of existenceas every fashion usually does. 
 Actually, self-criticism is an indispensable and permanent weapon in the arsenal of Bolshevism, one that is intimately linked with thevery nature of Bolshevism, with its revolutionary spirit. 
 It is sometimes said that self-criticism is some-thing that is good for a party which has not yet come topower and has “nothing to lose,” but that it is danger-ous and harmful to a party which has already come to power, which is surrounded by hostile forces, and againstwhich an exposure of its weaknesses may be exploited by its enemies. 
 That is not true. 
 It is quite untrue! On the contrary, just because Bolshevism has come to power, just be-cause Bolsheviks may become conceited owing to thesuccesses of our work of construction, just because Bol-sheviks may fail to observe their weaknesses and thus make things easier for their enemies—for these very reasons self-criticism is particularly needed now, afterthe assumption of power. 
 * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 The purpose of self-criticism being to disclose and eliminate our errors and weaknesses, is it not clear that in the conditions of the dictatorship of the prole-tariat it can only facilitate Bolshevism’s fight against the enemies of the working class? Lenin took into account these specific features of the situation which had arisenafter the Bolsheviks had seized power when, in April-May 1920, he wrote in his pamphlet “ Left-Wing ” Com-munism, an Infantile Disorder : “The attitude of a political party towards its own mistakes is one of the most important and surest ways of judging how se-rious the party is and how it in practice fulfils its obligations to-wards its class and the toiling masses. 
 Frankly admitting a mistake ,* ascertaining the reasons for it, analysing the circumstances whichgave rise to it, and thoroughly discussing the means of correcting it—that is the earmark of a serious party; that is the way it should perform its duties, that is the way it should educate and trainthe class , and then the masses ” (V ol. 
 XXV , p. 
 200). 
 Lenin was a thousand times right when he said at the Eleventh Party Congress in March 1922: “The proletariat is not afraid to admit that this or that thing has succeeded splendidly in its revolution, and this or that has not succeeded. 
 All revolutionary parties which have hitherto perished, did so because they grew conceited , failed to see where their strength lay, and feared to speak of their weaknesses . 
* But we shall not perish, for we do not fear to speak of our weaknesses and shall learn to overcome them” (V ol. 
 XXVII, pp. 
 260-61). 
 There is only one conclusion: that without self-crit-icism there can be no proper education of the Party,the class, and the masses; and that without proper * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 education of the Party, the class, and the masses, there can bo no Bolshevism. 
 Why has the slogan of self-criticism acquired spe-cial importance just now, at this particular moment of history, in 1928? Because the growing acuteness of class relations, both in the internal and external spheres, is more glaring-ly evident now than it was a year or two ago. 
 Because the subversive activities of the class ene-mies of the Soviet Government, who are utilising our weaknesses, our errors, against the working class of our country, are more glaringly evident now than theywere a year or two ago. 
 Because we cannot and must not allow the lessons of the Shakhty affair and the “procurement manoeu-vres” of the capitalist elements in the countryside, coupled with our mistakes in planning, to go un-heeded. 
 If we want to strengthen the revolution and meet our enemies fully prepared, we must rid ourselves as quickly as possible of our errors and weaknesses, as dis-closed by the Shakhty affair and the grain procurement difficulties. 
 If we do not want to be caught unawares by all sorts of “surprises” and “accidents,” to the joy of the ene-mies of the working class, we must disclose as quickly as possible those weaknesses and errors of ours which have not yet been disclosed , but which undoubtedly exist. 
 If we are tardy in this, we shall be facilitating the work of our enemies and aggravating our weaknesses and errors. 
 But all this will be impossible if self-crit-icism is not developed and stimulated, if the vast masses of the working class and peasantry are not drawn into the work of bringing to light and eliminat-ing our weaknesses and errors. 
 The April plenum of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
 was there-fore quite right when it said in its resolution on theShakhty affair: “The chief condition for the successful accomplishment of all the indicated measures is the effective implementation of the slogan of self-criticism issued by the Fifteenth Congress. 
” *37 But in order to develop self-criticism, we must first overcome a number of obstacles standing in the way of the Party. 
 These include the cultural back-wardness of the masses, the inadequate cultural forces of the proletarian vanguard, our conservatism, our “communist vainglory,” and so on. 
 But one of the mostserious obstacles, if not the most serious of all, is the bureaucracy of our apparatus. 
 I am referring to the bureaucratic elements to be found in our Party, govern-ment, trade-union, co-operative and all other organisa-tions. 
 I am referring to the bureaucratic elements who batten on our weaknesses and errors, who fear like theplague all criticism by the masses, all control by the masses, and who hinder us in developing self-criticism and ridding ourselves of our weaknesses and errors. 
Bureaucracy in our organisations must not be regarded merely as routine and red-tape. 
 Bureaucracy is a mani-festation of bourgeois influence on our organisations. 
Lenin was right when he said: * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 “. 
 . 
 . 
 We must realise that the fight against bureaucracy is an absolutely essential one, and that it is just as complicated as the fight against the petty-bourgeois elemental forces. 
 Bureauc-racy in our state system has become a malady of such gravity that it is spoken of in our Party programme, and that is because it is connected with these petty-bourgeois elemental forces and their wide dispersion ”* (V ol. 
 XXVI, p. 
 220). 
 With all the more persistence, therefore, must the struggle against bureaucracy in our organisations be waged, if we really want to develop self-criticism and rid ourselves of the maladies in our constructive work. 
 With all the more persistence must we rouse the vast masses of the workers and peasants to the task of criticism from below , of control from below , as the prin-cipal antidote to bureaucracy. 
 Lenin was right when he said: “If we want to combat bureaucracy, we must enlist the co-operation of the rank and file ” . 
 . 
 . 
 for “what other way is there of putting an end to bureaucracy than by enlisting the co-opera-tion of the workers and peasants ?”* (V ol. 
 XXV , pp. 
 496 and 495. 
) But in order to “enlist the co-operation” of the vast masses, we must develop proletarian democracy in all the mass organisations of the working class, and primarily within the Party itself. 
 Failing this, self-criticism will be nothing, an empty thing, a mere word. 
 It is not just any kind of self-criticism that we need. 
 We need such self-criticism as will raise the culturallevel of the working class, enhance its fighting spirit, fortify its faith in victory, augment its strength and help it to become the real master of the country. 
 * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 Some say that, once there is self-criticism, we do not need labour discipline , we can stop working and give ourselves over to prattling a little about every-thing. 
 That would be not self-criticism but an in-sult to the working class. 
 Self-criticism is needed not in order to shatter labour discipline, but to strengthen i t, in order that labour discipline may become conscious discipline, capable of withstanding petty-bourgeois slackness. 
 Others say that, once there is self-criticism, we no longer need leadership , we can abandon the helm and let things “take their natural course. 
” That would benot self-criticism but a disgrace. 
 Self-criticism is needed not in order to relax leadership, but to strengthen it, in order to convert it from leadership on paper and oflittle authority into vigorous and really authoritative leadership. 
 But there is another kind of “self-criticism,” one that tends to destroy the Party spirit, to discredit th e Soviet regime, to weaken our work of construction, to corrupt our economic cadres, to disarm the working class, and to foster talk of degeneration . 
 It was just this kind of “self-criticism” that the Trotsky opposition was urging upon us only recently. 
 It goes without sayingthat the Party has nothing in common with such “self-criticism. 
” It goes without saying that the Party will combat such “self-criticism” with might and main. 
 A strict distinction must be drawn between this “self-criticism,” which is alien to us, destructive and anti-Bolshevik, and our, Bolshevik self-criticism, the object of which is to promote the Party spirit, to consol-idate the Soviet regime, to improve our constructive work, to strengthen our economic cadres, to arm the working class. 
 Our campaign for intensifying self-criticism began only a few months ago. 
 We have not yet the necessary data for a review of the first results of the campaign. 
 But it may already be said that the campaign is beginningto yield beneficial fruits. 
 It cannot be denied that the tide of self-criticism is beginning to mount and spread, extending to everlarger sections of the working class and drawing them into the work of socialist construction. 
 This is borne out if only by such facts as the revival of the productionconferences and the temporary control commissions. 
 True, there are still attempts to pigeon-hole well-founded and verified recommendations of the produc-tion conferences and temporary control commissions. 
 Such attempts must be fought with the utmost dete-mination, for their purpose is to discourage the workersfrom self-criticism. 
 But there is scarcely reason to doubt that such bureaucratic attempts will be swept away completely by the mounting tide of self-criticism. 
 Nor can it be denied that, as a result of self-criti-cism, our business executives are beginning to smarten up, to become more vigilant, to approach questions ofeconomic leadership more seriously, while our Party, Soviet, trade-union and all other personnel are becom-ing more sensitive and responsive to the requirements of the masses. 
 True, it cannot be said that inner-Party democracy and working-class democracy generally are alreadyfully established in the mass organisations of the work-ing class. 
 But there is no reason to doubt that further advances will be made in this field as the campaign unfolds. 
 Nor can it be denied that, as a result of self-criti-cism, our press has become more lively and vigorous, while such detachments of our press workers as the organisations of worker and village correspondents arealready becoming a weighty political force. 
 True, our press still continues at times to skate on the surface; it has not yet learned to pass from individ-ual critical remarks to deeper criticism, and from deep criticism to drawing general conclusions from the results of criticism and making plain what achievements have been attained in our constructive work as a result of criticism. 
 But it can scarcely be doubted that ad-vances will be made in this field as the campaign goes on. 
 However, along with these good aspects of our cam-paign, it is necessary to note some bad aspects. 
 I am referring to those distortions of the slogan of self-crit-icism which are already occurring at the beginning of the campaign and which, if they are not resisted at once, may give rise to the danger of self-criticism beingvulgarised. 
 1) It must be observed, in the first place, that a number of press periodicals are betraying a tendencyto transplant the campaign from the field of business-like criticisms of shortcomings in our socialist construc-tion to the field of ostentatious outcries against excesses in private life . 
 This may seem incredible. 
 But, unfor-tunately, it is a fact. 
 Take the newspaper Vlast Truda , for example, organ of the Irkutsk Okrug Party Committee and Okrug So-viet Executive Committee (No. 
 128). 
 There you will find a whole page peppered all over with ostentatious “slogans,” such as: “Sexual Promiscuity—a Bourgeois Vice”; “One Glass Leads to Another”; “Own CottageCalls for Own Cow”; “Double-Bed Bandits”; “A Shot That Misfired,” and so on and so forth. 
 What, one asks, can there be in common between these “critical” shrieks,which are worthy of Birzhovka , 38 and Bolshevik self-criticism, the purpose of which is to improve our so-cialist construction ? It is very possible that the author of these ostentatious items is a Communist. 
 It is pos-sible that he is burning with hatred of the “class ene-mies” of the Soviet regime. 
 But that he is straying fromthe right path, that he is vulgarising the slogan of self-criticism, and that his voice is the voice not of our class, of that there cannot be any doubt. 
 2) It must be observed, further, that even those organs of the press which, generally speaking, are not devoid of the ability to criticise correctly, that eventhey are sometimes inclined to criticise for criticism ’s sake , turning criticism into a sport, into sensation-mongering . 
 Take Komsomolskaya Pravda , for example. 
 Everyone knows the services rendered by Komsomol-skaya Pravda in stimulating self-criticism. 
 But take the last issues of this paper and look at its “criticism”of the leaders of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions—a whole series of impermissible caricatures on the subject. 
 Who, one asks, needs “criticism” of thiskind, and what effect can it have except to discredit the slogan of self-criticism? What is the use of such “criticism,” looked at, of course, from the standpointof the interests of our socialist construction and not of cheap sensation-mongering designed to give the phi-listine something to chuckle over? Of course, all forms of arms are required for self-criticism, including the “light cavalry. 
” But does this mean that the light cav-alry must be turned into light-minded cavalry? 3) It must be observed, lastly, that there is a defi-nite tendency on the part of a number of our organi-sations to turn sell-criticism into a witch-hunt against our business executives, into an attempt to discredit them in the eyes of the working class. 
 It is a fact thatcertain local organisations in the Ukraine and Central Russia have started a regular witch-hunt against some of our best business executives, whose only fault is that they are not 100 per cent immune from error. 
 How else are we to understand the decisions of the local organi-sations to remove these executives from their posts, deci-sions which have no binding force whatever and which are obviously designed to discredit them? How else are we to understand the fact that these executives arecriticised, but are given no opportunity to answer the criticism? When did we begin to pass off a “Shemyaka court”* as self-criticism? Of course, we cannot demand that criticism should be 100 per cent correct. 
 If the criticism comes from below, we must not ignore it even if it is only 5 or 10per cent correct. 
 All that is true. 
 But does this mean that we must demand that business executives should be 100 per cent immune from error? Is there any onein creation who is immune from error 100 per cent? Is it so hard to understand that it takes years and years to * A “Shemyaka court”: an unjust court. 
 (From an ancient Russian story about a judge named Shemyaka. 
)— Tr. 
 train our economic cadres and that our attitude towards them must be one of the utmost consideration and solicitude? Is it so hard to understand that we needself-criticism not for the sake of a witch-hunt against our economic cadres, but in order to improve and perfect them? Criticise the shortcomings of our constructive work, but do not vulgarise the slogan of self-criticism and do not turn it into a medium for ostentatious exerciseson such themes as “Double-Bed Bandits,” “A Shot That Misfired,” and so on. 
 Criticise the shortcomings in our constructive work, but do not discredit the slogan of self-criticism and do not turn it into a means of cooking up cheap sensations. 
 Criticise the shortcomings in our constructive work, but do not pervert the slogan of self-criticism and do not turn it into a weapon for witch-hunts against our business or any other executives. 
 And the chief thing: do not substitute for mass crit-icism from below “critical” fireworks from above ; let the working-class masses come into it and display theircreative initiative in correcting our shortcomings and in improving our constructive work.

(B. 
)39 July 4-12, 1928 Published for the first time THE PROGRAMME OF THE COMINTERN Speech Delivered on July 5, 1928 The first thing we have to consider, comrades, is the size of the draft programme of the Comintern. 
40 Some say that the draft programme is too large, too ponderous. 
 They demand that it be compressed to a half or a third. 
 They demand that some general for-mulas should be given in the programme and nothing more, and that these formulas be called a programme. 
 I think that these demands are devoid of foundation. 
 Those who demand that the programme be compressed to a half or even a third do not understand the tasks that confronted those who drew up the draft. 
 The pointis that the programme of the Comintern cannot be the programme of any one national party, or, say, a pro-gramme for only the “civilised” nations. 
 The programmemust cover all the Communist Parties of the world, all nations, all peoples, both white and black. 
 That is the basic and characteristic feature of the draft programme. 
But how is it possible to cover the basic needs and basic lines of work of all the sections of the Comintern, both Eastern and Western, if the programme is compressedto a half or a third? Let the comrades try to solve this insoluble problem. 
 That is why I think that to compress the programme to a half or a third would mean con-verting it from a programme into a mere list of abstract formulas without any value for the sections of the Com-intern. 
 Those who drew up the programme were faced with a double problem: on the one hand, to cover the chiefand basic features of all the Communist Parties of the world, and, on the other hand, to do so in such a way that the various propositions of the programme shouldnot be empty formulas, but should provide practical guiding principles for the most diverse countries and peoples, for the most diverse Communist Parties andcommunist groups. 
 You must agree that it is quite impossible to solve this double problem in a brief and concise draft. 
 What is most curious is that the very comrades who propose that the programme be compressed to a half or even a third, also put forward proposals which wouldtend to expand the present draft programme to twice, if not three times its size. 
 In point of fact, if we are to give in the draft programme lengthy formulations onthe trade unions, on the co-operatives, on culture, on the European national minorities and so on, is it not obvious that the effect of this cannot be to compressthe programme? The size of the present draft would have to be doubled, if not trebled. 
 The same thing must be said of those comrades who demand either that the programme be a concrete instruc-tion for the Communist Parties, or that it explain every possible thing, down to the individual propositions init. 
 In the first place, it is wrong to say that the programme must be only an instruction, or mainly an instruction. 
 That is wrong. 
 That cannot be demanded of a programme, to say nothing of the fact that the result would be to enlarge the size of the programme incredibly. 
 In thesecond place, a programme cannot explain every pos-sible thing, down to its individual declarative or theo-retical propositions. 
 That is the business of commen-taries to the programme. 
 A programme must not be con-fused with a commentary. 
 The second question concerns the structure of the programme and the order of arrangement of the individ-ual chapters within the draft programme. 
 Some comrades demand that the chapter on the ulti-mate aim of the movement, on communism, be trans-ferred to the end of the programme. 
 I think that this demand also is devoid of foundation. 
 Between the chap-ter on the crisis of capitalism and the chapter on the transition period, there is in the draft programme a chapter on communism, on the communist economicsystem. 
 Is this arrangement of chapters correct? I con-sider that it is quite correct. 
 You cannot speak of the transition period without first speaking of the eco-nomic system, in this case the communist economic system, the transition to which the programme proposes. 
 We speak of the transition period, the transitionfrom capitalism to another economic system. 
 But a transition to what, to what system exactly—that is what must be first discussed before proceeding to de-scribe the transition period itself. 
 The programme should proceed from the unknown to the known, from the less known to the better known. 
 To speak of the crisis ofcapitalism and then of the transition period, without first speaking of the system to which the transition is to be made, would confuse the reader and infringe an elementary requirement of pedagogy, one that is at the same time a requirement for the structure of the pro-gramme. 
 Well, the programme should make it easier for the reader in leading him from the less known to the better known, and not make it more difficult forhim. 
 Other comrades think that the paragraph on Social-Democracy ought not to be included in the second chap-ter of the draft programme, which deals with the first phase of the proletarian revolution and with the partial stabilisation of capitalism. 
 They think that they arethereby raising a question of the structure of the pro-gramme. 
 That is not so, comrades. 
 Actually, it is a polit-ical question that confronts us here. 
 To delete the par-agraph on Social-Democracy from the second chapter would be to commit a political mistake in regard to one of the basic questions of the reasons for the partial stab-ilisation of capitalism. 
 It is not a matter here of the structure of the programme, but of the appraisal of the political situation in the period of partial stabilisation,an appraisal of the counter-revolutionary role of Social-Democracy as one of the factors of this stabilisation. 
 These comrades cannot but know that we cannot dispensewith a paragraph on Social-Democracy in the chapter on the partial stabilisation of capitalism, because this stabilisation itself cannot be explained without describ-ing the role of Social-Democracy as one of the major factors of the stabilisation. 
 Otherwise, we should also have to exclude from this chapter the paragraph onfascism, and transfer it, like the paragraph on Social-Democracy, to the chapter on parties. 
 But to exclude these two paragraphs—on fascism and on Social-De-mocracy—from the chapter dealing with the partial stabilisation of capitalism would mean to disarm our-selves and deprive ourselves of all possibility of ex-plaining the capitalist stabilisation. 
 Obviously, we cannot agree to that. 
 The question of NEP and war communism . 
 NEP is a policy of the proletarian dictatorship which is designed to overcome the capitalist elements and to build a social-ist economy by utilising the market and through the market, and not by direct products-exchange, with-out a market and apart from the market. 
 Can capi-talist countries, even the most highly developed, dis-pense with NEP in the transition from capitalism to socialism? I do not think that they can. 
 In one degreeor another, the New Economic Policy, with its market connections, and the utilisation of these market con-nections, will be absolutely essential for every capital-ist country in the period of the dictatorship of the pro-letariat. 
 We have comrades who deny this proposition. 
 But what does denying this proposition mean? It means, in the first place, to hold that immedi-ately after the proletariat has come to power we shallhave ready to function 100 per cent a machinery of distribution and supply between town and country, between industry and small-scale production, whichwill make it possible to establish at once direct products-exchange, without a market, without commodity circulation, and without a money economy. 
 The matterhas only to be raised to realise how utterly absurd such an assumption is. 
 It means, in the second place, to hold that after the seizure of power by the proletariat the proletarian revo-lution must adopt the course of expropriating the middleand petty bourgeoisie, must take upon its shoulders the incredible burden of finding work and assuring means of subsistence for an artificially created army of mil-lions of new unemployed. 
 The matter has only to be raised to realise how ridiculous and foolish it would be for the proletarian dictatorship to adopt such a policy. 
One of the good things about NEP is that it relieves the proletarian dictatorship of these and similar difficulties. 
 But it follows from this that NEP is an inevitable phase of the socialist revolution in all countries. 
 Can the same thing be said of war communism? Can it be said that war communism is an inevitable phaseof the proletarian revolution? No, it cannot. 
 War commu-nism is a policy forced upon the proletarian dictator-ship by a situation of war and intervention; it is designedfor the establishment of direct products-exchange between town and country, not through the market but apart from the market, chiefly by measures of an extra-eco-nomic and partially military character, and aims at organising such a distribution of products as can ensure the supply of the revolutionary armies at the front andof the workers in the rear. 
 Obviously, if there had not been a situation of war and intervention, there would have been no war communism. 
 Consequently, it cannotbe asserted that war communism is an economically inevitable phase of development of the proletarian revolution. 
 It would be incorrect to think that the proletarian dictatorship in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 began its economic work with war communism. 
 Some comrades incline towards this opinion. 
 But it is a wrong opinion. 
 On the contrary, the proletarian dictatorship in our country began itsconstructive work not with war communism, but with the proclamation of the principles of what is called the New Economic Policy. 
 Everyone is familiar with Lenin’spamphlet, The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Power , 41 which was published in the beginning of 1918, and in which Lenin first substantiated the principles of theNew Economic Policy. 
 True, this policy was tempora-rily interrupted by the conditions of intervention, and it was only three years later, when war and interven-tion had been ended, that it had to be resumed. 
 But the fact that the proletarian dictatorship in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 had to return to the principles of the New EconomicPolicy, which had already been proclaimed at the begin-ning of 1918—this fact plainly shows where the prole-tarian dictatorship must begin its constructive workon the day following the revolution, and on what it must base its constructive work—if, of course, it is eco-nomic considerations we have in mind. 
 Sometimes war communism is confused with the civil war, and the two are identified. 
 That, of course, is incorrect. 
 The seizure of power by the proletariat inOctober 1917 was undoubtedly a form of civil war. 
 But it would be wrong to say that we began to apply war communism in October 1917. 
 It is quite possibleto conceive a state of civil war in which the methods of war communism are not applied, in which the prin-ciples of the New Economic Policy are not abandoned,as was the case in our country in the early part of 1918, before the intervention. 
 Some say that the proletarian revolutions will take place in isolation from one another, and that therefore not a single proletarian revolution will be able to escapeintervention, and hence war communism. 
 That is not true. 
 Now that we have succeeded in consolidating Soviet power in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
, now that the CommunistParties in the principal capitalist countries have grown and the Comintern has increased in strength, there cannot and should not be isolated proletarian revolu-tions. 
 We must not overlook such factors as the increas-ing acuteness of the crisis of world capitalism, the exist-ence of the Soviet Union, and the growth of commu-nism in all countries. 
 ( A voice : “But the revolution in Hungary was isolated. 
”) That was in 1919. 
 42 Now we are in 1928. 
 It suffices to recall the revolution in Ger-many in 1923, 43 when the proletarian dictatorship in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 was getting ready to render direct assist-ance to the German revolution, to realise how utterlyrelative and conditional the arguments of some com-rades are. 
 ( A voice : “The isolated revolution in Germany— the isolation between France and Germany. 
”) You areconfusing spatial remoteness with political isolation. 
 Spatial remoteness is, of course, a factor. 
 Nevertheless, it should not be confused with political isolation. 
 And what about the workers in the interventionist countries?—do you think they will remain silent if there is intervention in a German revolution, say, and will not strike at the interventionists from the rear? And what about the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 and its proletariat?— do you think that the proletarian revolution in theU. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 will look calmly on at the misdeeds of the interventionists? To injure the interventionists, it is by no means essential to establish spatial connection with the revo-lutionary country. 
 It is enough to sting the interven-tionists at those points in their own territory which are most vulnerable to make them sense the danger and comprehend the full reality of proletarian solidar-ity. 
 Suppose that we offended bourgeois Britain in the Leningrad area and caused her serious damage. 
 Does it follow that Britain would necessarily take revengeon us in Leningrad? No, it does not. 
 She might take revenge on us somewhere else, in Batum, Odessa, Baku, or Vladivostok, say. 
 The same is true of the forms ofassistance and support rendered by the proletarian dictatorship to a proletarian revolution in one of the countries of Europe, say, against imperialist interven-tionists. 
 But while it cannot be admitted that intervention, and hence war communism, must necessarily occur in all countries, it can and should be admitted that they are more or less probable. 
 Therefore, while not agreeing with the arguments of these comrades, I do agree withtheir conclusion, namely, that the formula in the draft programme which speaks of the possibility , in definite international conditions, of war communism in coun-tries where a proletarian revolution has taken place, might be replaced by a formula saying that intervention and war communism are more or less probable . 
 The question of the nationalisation of the land . 
 I do not agree with those comrades who propose that the formula on the nationalisation of the land in the caseof capitalistically developed countries should be altered, and who demand that in such countries the nationali-sation of all the land should be proclaimed on the first day of the proletarian revolution. 
 Nor do I agree with those comrades who propose that nothing at all should be said about the nationalisa-tion of all the land in the capitalistically developed coun-tries. 
 In my opinion, it would be better to speak, as thedraft programme does, of the eventual nationalisation of all the land, with an addition to the effect that the right of the small and middle peasants to use of the landwill be guaranteed. 
 Those comrades are mistaken who think that the more capitalistically developed a country is, the easierit will be to nationalise all the land in that country. 
 On the contrary, the more capitalistically developed a country is, the more difficult will it be to nationaliseall the land, because the stronger are the traditions of private ownership of the land in that country, and the harder, therefore, will it be to combat those traditions. 
 Read Lenin’s theses on the agrarian question at the Second Congress of the Comintern, 44 where he explic-itly warns against hasty and incautious steps in thisdirection, and you will understand how mistaken the assertions of these comrades are. 
 In the capitalistically developed countries private ownership of the land hasexisted for centuries, which cannot be said of the coun-tries less developed capitalistically, where the princi-ple of private ownership of the land has not yet be-come deeply rooted in the peasantry. 
 Here, in Russia, the peasants at one time even used to say that the land belonged to no man, that it was God’s land. 
 This,in fact, explains why as early as 1906, in expectation of a bourgeois-democratic revolution in our country, Lenin put forward the slogan of the nationalisation of all the land, with the proviso that the small and middle peasants should be guaranteed the use of the land, con-sidering that the peasants would understand this and reconcile themselves to it. 
 Is it not noteworthy, on the other hand, that in 1920, at the Second Congress of the Comintern, Lenin himself warned the Communist Parties of the capitalistically developed countries not to put forward immediatelythe slogan of nationalising all the land, since the peas-ants of these countries, imbued as they are with the private property instinct, would not stomach such aslogan at once. 
 Can we ignore this difference and refuse to pay heed to Lenin’s recommendations? Obviously, we cannot. 
 The question of the inner substance of the draft pro-gramme. 
 It appears that certain comrades consider that in its inner substance the draft programme is not quiteinternational, because, they say, it is “too Russian” in character. 
 I have not heard such objections put for-ward here. 
 But it appears that such objections existin some circles round about the Comintern. 
 What can have furnished grounds for such an opinion? Is it, perhaps, the fact that the draft programme contains a special chapter on the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
? But what can there be bad in that? Is our revolution, in its char-acter , a national and only a national revolution, and not pre-eminently an international revolution? If so, why do we call it a base of the world revolutiona-ry movement, an instrument for the revolutionary de-velopment of all countries, the motherland of the world proletariat? There were people among us—our oppositionists, for instance—who considered that the revolution in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 was exclusively or mainly a national revo-lution. 
 It was on this point that they came to grief. 
 It is strange that there are people round about the Com-intern, it appears, who are prepared to follow in thefootsteps of the oppositionists. 
 Perhaps our revolution is, in type , a national and only a national revolution? But our revolution is aSoviet revolution, and the Soviet form of proletarian state is more or less obligatory for the dictatorship of the proletariat in other countries. 
 It is not withoutreason that Lenin said that the revolution in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 had ushered in a new era in the history of development, the era of Soviets. 
 Does it not follow from this that,not only as regards its character but also as regards its type, our revolution is pre-eminently an international revolution, one that presents a pattern of what, inthe main, a proletarian revolution should be in any country? Undoubtedly, the international character of our revolution imposes upon the proletarian dictatorship in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 certain duties towards the proletarians and oppressed masses of the whole world. 
 This was whatLenin had in mind when he said that the proletarian dictatorship in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 exists in order to do everything possible for the development and victoryof the proletarian revolution in other countries. 
 But what follows from this? It follows, at least, that our revolution is part of the world revolution, a base andan instrument of the world revolutionary movement. 
 Undoubtedly, too, not only has the revolution in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 duties towards the proletarians of all coun-tries, duties which it is discharging, but the proletar-ians of all countries have certain fairly important du-ties towards the proletarian dictatorship in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 These duties consist in supporting the proletariat of the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 in its struggle against internal and externalenemies, in war against a war designed to strangle the proletarian dictatorship in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
, in advocating that imperialist armies should directly go over to theside of the proletarian dictatorship in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 in the event of an attack on the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 But does it not follow from this that the revolution in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
is inseparable from the revolutionary movement in other countries, that the triumph of the revolution in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 is a triumph for the revolution throughout theworld? Is it possible, after all this, to speak of the revolu-tion in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 as being only a national revolution,isolated from and having no connection with the revo-lutionary movement throughout the world? And, on the other hand, is it possible, after all this, to understand anything at all about the world revolu-tionary movement, if it is considered out of connection with the proletarian revolution in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
? What would be the value of the programme of the Comintern, which deals with the world proletarian revo-lution, if it ignored the fundamental question of the character and tasks of the proletarian revolution in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
, its duties towards the proletarians of all countries, and the duties of the proletarians of all countries towards the proletarian dictatorship in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
? That is why I think that the objections concerning the “Russian character” of the draft programme of the Comintern bear the stamp—how shall I put it mildly?—well, a bad stamp, an unpleasant flavour. 
 Let us pass to a few separate remarks. 
 I consider that those comrades are right who sug-gest amending the sentence on page 55 of the draft pro-gramme which speaks of the labouring sections of the rural population “who follow the proletarian dictator-ship. 
” This sentence is an obvious misunderstand-ing, or perhaps it is a proof-reader’s error. 
 It should be amended. 
 But these comrades are quite wrong when they pro-pose the inclusion in the draft programme of all the definitions of the dictatorship of the proletariat givenby Lenin. 
 ( Laughter . 
) On page 52 we have the following definition of the dictatorship of the proletariat, taken in the main from Lenin: “The dictatorship of the proletariat is the continuation of its class struggle in new conditions. 
 The dictatorship of the pro-letariat is a stubborn struggle—bloody and bloodless, violentand peaceful, military and economic, educational and administra-tive—against the forces and traditions of the old society, againstthe external capitalist enemies, against the remnants of the ex-ploiting classes at home, against the shoots of a new bourgeoisiethat spring from the soil of commodity production which has notyet been eliminated. 
” 45 The draft programme contains also a number of other definitions of the dictatorship, corresponding to theparticular tasks of the dictatorship at various stages of the proletarian revolution. 
 I think that this is quite sufficient. 
 ( A voice : “One of Lenin’s formulations has been omitted. 
”) Lenin has whole pages on the dictator-ship of the proletariat. 
 If they were all to be included inthe draft programme, I am afraid it would be increased to at least three times its size. 
 Incorrect, too, is the objection raised by some com-rades to the thesis on the neutralisation of the middle peasantry. 
 In his theses at the Second Congress of the Com-intern, Lenin explicitly states that on the eve of the seizureof power and in the first stage of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the capitalist countries the Communist Parties cannot count on anything more than neutralisingthe middle peasantry. 
 Lenin explicitly states that only after the dictatorship of the proletariat has been consol-idated can the Communist Parties count on organisinga stable alliance with the middle peasant. 
 Clearly, when compiling the draft programme, we could not ig-nore this directive of Lenin’s, to say nothing of the factthat it coincides exactly with the experience of our rev-olution. 
 Incorrect, too, is the comment on the national ques- tion made by a number of comrades. 
 These comrades have no grounds for asserting that the draft programme ignores the national factors in the revolutionary move-ment. 
 The question of the colonies is fundamentally a national one. 
 Imperialist oppression, oppression in the colonies, national self-determination, the right of na-tions and colonies to secession, etc. 
, are given sufficient prominence in the draft programme. 
 If it is the national minorities in Central Europe that these comrades have in mind, this may be men-tioned in the draft programme, but I am opposed to the national question in Central Europe being given sepa-rate treatment in it. 
 Lastly, as to the remarks made by a number of com-rades on the statement that Poland is a country represent-ing the second type of development towards proletarian dictatorship. 
 These comrades think that the classifica-tion of countries into three types—countries with a high capitalist development (America, Germany, Brit-ain), countries with an average capitalist development(Poland, Russia before the February Revolution, etc. 
), and colonial countries—is wrong. 
 They maintain that Poland should be included in the first type of countries,that one can speak only of two types of countries—capi-talist and colonial. 
 That is not true, comrades. 
 Besides capitalistically developed countries, where the victory of the revolu-tion will lead at once to the proletarian dictatorship, there are countries which are little developed capitalist-ically, where there are feudal survivals and a special agrarian problem of the anti-feudal type (Poland, Ru-mania, etc. 
), countries where the petty bourgeoisie,especially the peasantry, is bound to have a weighty word to say in the event of a revolutionary upheaval, and where the victory of the revolution, in order to leadto a proletarian dictatorship, can and certainly will re-quire certain intermediate stages, in the form, say, of a dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry. 
 In our country, too, there were people, such as Trotsky, who before the February Revolution said that the peasantry was not of serious consequence, and thatthe slogan of the moment was “no tsar, but a workers’ government. 
” You know that Lenin emphatically dis-sociated himself from this slogan and objected to any underestimation of the role and importance of the petty bourgeoisie, especially of the peasantry. 
 There weresome in our country at that time who thought that after the overthrow of tsarism the proletariat would at once occupy the predominating position. 
 But how did it turnout in reality? It turned out that immediately after the February Revolution the vast masses of the petty bourgeoisie appeared on the scene and gave predomi-nance to the petty-bourgeois parties, the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries and the Mensheviks. 
 The Socialist-Revolution-aries and the Mensheviks, who had been tiny partiesuntil then, “suddenly” became the predominating force in the country. 
 Thanks to what? Thanks to the fact that the vast masses of the petty bourgeoisie at first supportedthe Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. 
 This, incidently, explains why the proletarian dic-tatorship was established in our country as a result ofthe more or less rapid growing over of the bourgeois-democratic revolution into a socialist revolution. 
 There is scarcely reason to doubt that Poland and Rumania belong to the category of countries which will have to pass, more or less rapidly, through certain inter-mediate stages on the way to the dictatorship of theproletariat. 
 That is why I think that these comrades are mistaken when they deny that there are three types of revolution-ary movement on the way towards the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 Poland and Rumania are representative of the second type. 
 These, comrades, are my remarks on the draft pro-gramme of the Comintern. 
 As to the style of the draft programme, or of cer-tain individual formulations, I cannot affirm that in this respect the draft programme is perfect. 
 It is tobe presumed that some things will have to be improved, more precisely defined, that the style, perhaps, will have to be simplified, and so on. 
 But that is a matterfor the Programme Commission of the Sixth Congress of the Comintern. 
 46 INDUSTRIALISATION AND THE GRAIN PROBLEM Speech Delivered on July 9, 1928 Comrades, before I pass to the specific question of our difficulties on the grain front, allow me to dealwith some general questions of theoretical interest which arose here during the discussion at the plenum. 
 First of all, the general question of the chief sources of development of our industry , the means of guarantee-ing our present rate of industrialisation. 
 Ossinsky and then Sokolnikov touched upon this question, perhaps without themselves realising it. 
 It is a question of paramount importance. 
 I think that there are two chief sources nourishing our industry: firstly, the working class; secondly, the peasantry. 
 In the capitalist countries industrialisation was usual-ly effected, in the main, by robbing other countries, by robbing colonies or defeated countries, or with the help of substantial and more or less enslaving loansfrom abroad. 
 You know that for hundreds of years Britain col-lected capital from all her colonies and from all partsof the world, and was able in this way to make addi-tional investments in her industry. 
 This, incidentally, explains why Britain at one time became the “workshop of the world. 
” You know also that Germany developed her industry with the help, among other things, of the 5,000 million francs she levied as an indemnity on France after the Franco-Prussian war. 
 One respect in which our country differs from the capitalist countries is that it cannot and must not en-gage in colonial robbery, or the plundering of other coun-tries in general. 
 That way, therefore, is closed to us. 
 Neither, however, does our country have or want to have enslaving loans from abroad. 
 Consequently, thatway, too, is closed to us. 
 What then remains? Only one thing, and that is to develop industry, to industrialise the country with thehelp of internal accumulations. 
 Under the bourgeois system in our country, industry, transport, etc. 
, were usually developed with the helpof loans. 
 Whether you take the building of new fac-tories or the re-equipment of old ones, whether you take the laying of new railways or the erection of big electricpower stations—not one of these undertakings was able to dispense with foreign loans. 
 But they were enslaving loans. 
 Quite different is the situation in our country under the Soviet system. 
 We are building the Turkestan Rail-way, with a length of 1,400 versts, which requires hun-dreds of millions of rubles. 
 We are erecting the Dnieper Hydro-Electric Power Station, which also requires hun-dreds of millions of rubles. 
 But have they involved usin any enslaving loans? No, they have not. 
 All this is being done with the help of internal accumulations. 
 But what are the chief sources of these accumula-tions? As I have said, there are two such sources: firstly, the working class, which creates values and advancesour industry; secondly, the peasantry. 
 The way matters stand with the peasantry in this re-spect is as follows: it not only pays the state the usualtaxes, direct and indirect; it also overpays in the rela-tively high prices for manufactured goods—that is in the first place, and it is more or less underpaid in the prices for agricultural produce—that is in the second place. 
 This is an additional tax levied on the peasantry for the sake of promoting industry, which caters for the whole country, the peasantry included. 
 It is something in the nature of a “tribute,” of a supertax, which weare compelled to levy for the time being in order to preserve and accelerate our present rate of industrial development, in order to ensure an industry for thewhole country, in order to raise further the standard of life of the rural population and then to abolish al-together this additional tax, these “scissors” betweentown and country. 
 It is an unpalatable business, there is no denying. 
 But we should not be Bolsheviks if we slurred over itand closed our eyes to the fact that, unfortunately, our industry and our country cannot at present dispense with this additional tax on the peasantry. 
 Why do I speak of this? Because some comrades, ap-parently, do not understand this indisputable truth. 
 They based their speeches on the fact that the peasantsare overpaying for manufactured goods, which is abso-lutely true, and are being underpaid for agricultural produce, which is also true. 
 But what do they demand? They demand the establishment of replacement prices for grain, so that these “scissors,” these underpaymentsand overpayments, would be done away with at once . 
 But what would be the effect of doing away with the “scissors” this year or next year, say? The effect wouldbe to retard the industrialisation of the country, in-cluding the industrialisation of agriculture, to under-mine our young industry which is not yet firmly on itsfeet, and thus to strike at our entire national economy. 
 Can we agree to this? Obviously, we cannot. 
 Should the “scissors” between town and country, should all theseunderpayments and overpayments be done away with? Yes, they certainly should. 
 Can we do away with them at once without weakening our industry, and hence ournational economy? No, we cannot. 
 What, then, should our policy be? It should be grad-ually to close the “scissors,” to diminish the gap fromyear to year, by lowering the prices for manufactured goods and improving agricultural technique—which cannot but result in reducing the cost of producing grain—and then, within the space of a number of years, to do away completely with this additional tax on the peas-antry. 
 Are the peasants capable of bearing this burden? They undoubtedly are: firstly, because this burden will grow lighter from year to year, and, secondly, becausethis additional tax is being levied not under conditions of capitalist development, where the masses of the peas-antry are condemned to poverty and exploitation, butunder Soviet conditions, where exploitation of the peas-ants by the socialist state is out of the question, and where this additional tax is being paid in a situation in which the living standards of the peasantry are stead-ily rising. 
 That is how matters stand with regard to the basic sources of the industrialisation of our country at the present time. 
 The second question concerns the problem of the bond with the middle peasant —the problem of the aims of the bond and the means for effecting it. 
 It would follow from what some comrades say that the bond between town and country, between the work-ing class and the main mass of the peasantry, is basedexclusively on textiles, on satisfying the personal re-quirements of the peasantry. 
 Is this true? It is quite untrue, comrades. 
 Of course, it is of immense impor-tance to satisfy the peasants’ personal requirements for textiles. 
 That is how we began to establish the bond with the peasantry in the new conditions. 
 But to as-sert on these grounds that the bond based on textiles is the beginning and end of the matter, that the bond based on satisfying the peasants’ personal requirementsis the all-inclusive or chief foundation of the economic alliance between the working class and the peasantry, is to commit a most serious error. 
 Actually, the bondbetween town and country is based not only on satis-fying the peasants’ personal requirements, not only on textiles, but also on satisfying the economic require-ments of the peasants as producers of agricultural prod-ucts. 
 It is not only cotton fabrics that we give the peas-ants. 
 We also give them machines of all kinds, seeds, ploughs, fertilisers, etc. 
, which are of the weightiest importance for the advancement and socialist transfor-mation of peasant farming. 
 Hence, the bond is based not only on textiles, but also on metals. 
 Without this, the bond with the peas-antry would be insecure. 
 In what way does the bond based on textiles differ from the bond based on metals? Primarily in the fact that the bond based on textiles chiefly concerns the peas-ants’ personal requirements, without affecting, or af-fecting to a comparatively small extent, the production side of peasant farming, whereas the bond based on met-als chiefly concerns the production side of peasant farm-ing, improving it, mechanising it, making it more remu-nerative and paving the way for uniting the scattered and small peasant farms into large socially-conducted farms. 
 It would be a mistake to think that the purpose of the bond is to preserve classes, the peasant class in particular. 
 That is not so, comrades. 
 That is not thepurpose of the bond at all. 
 The purpose of the bond is to bring the peasantry closer to the working class, the leader of our entire development, to strengthen the alli-ance of the peasantry with the working class, the leading force in the alliance, gradually to remould the peasantry, its mentality and its production, along collectivist lines , and thus to bring about the conditions for the abolition of classes. 
 The purpose of the bond is not to preserve classes, but to abolish them. 
 Whereas the bond based on tex-tiles affects the production side of peasant farming very little and therefore, generally speaking, cannot resultin the remoulding of the peasantry along collectivist lines and in the abolition of classes, the bond based upon metals, on the contrary, affects primarily the produc-tion side of peasant farming, its mechanisation and its collectivisation, and for this very reason should resultin the gradual remoulding of the peasantry, in the grad-ual elimination of classes, including the peasant class. 
 How, in general, can the peasant—his mentality, his production—be remoulded, remade, along the lines of bringing his mentality closer to that of the working class, along the lines of the socialist principle of pro-duction? What does this require? It requires, firstly, the widest agitation on behalf of collectivism among the peasant masses. 
 It requires, secondly, implanting a co-operative com-munal life and the ever wider extension of our co-opera-tive supply and marketing organisations to the millions ofpeasant farms. 
 There can be no doubt that had it not been for the broad development of our co-operatives, we should not have that swing towards the collective-farm movement that we observe among the peasants at the present time, for the development of supply and marketing co-operatives is in our conditions a means ofpreparing the peasants for going over to collective farming. 
 But all this is still far from enough to remould the peasantry. 
 The principal force for remoulding the peas-antry along socialist lines lies in new technical means in agriculture, the mechanisation of agriculture, collec-tive peasant labour, and the electrification of the country. 
 Lenin has been referred to here, and a passage on the bond with peasant farming has been quoted fromhis works. 
 But to take Lenin in part, without desiring to take him as a whole, is to misrepresent Lenin. 
 Lenin was fully aware that the bond with the peasantry based on textile goods is a very important matter. 
 But he did not stop there, for, side by side with this, he insistedthat the bond with the peasantry should be based also on metals, on supplying the peasant with machines, on the electrification of the country, that is, on all thosethings which promote the remaking and remoulding of peasant farming on collectivist lines. 
 Please listen, for example, to the following quota-tion from Lenin: “The remaking of the small tiller, the remoulding of his whole mentality and habits, is a work of generations. 
 As regards the small tiller, this problem can be solved, his whole mentality can be put on healthy lines, so to speak, only by the material base, by technical means, by introducing tractors and machinesin agriculture on a mass scale, by electrification on a mass scale. 
 That is what would remake the small tiller fundamentally and with immense rapidity” (V ol. 
 XXVI, p. 
 239). 
 Quite clearly, the alliance between the working class and the peasantry cannot be stable and lasting, the bond cannot be stable and lasting and cannot attain its purpose of gradually remoulding the peasantry, bringingit closer to the working class and putting it on collec-tivist lines, if the bond based on textiles is not supple-mented by the bond based on metals. 
 That is how Comrade Lenin understood the bond. 
 The third question is that of the New Economic Pol-icy (NEP) and the class struggle under NEP conditions . 
 It is necessary first of all to establish the point that the principles of NEP were laid down by our Party not after war communism, as certain comrades sometimesassert, but before it, already at the beginning of 1918, when we were able for the first time to set about build-ing a new, socialist economy. 
 I could refer to Ilyich’s pamphlet, The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Power , published in the beginning of 1918, where the principles of NEP are set forth. 
 When the intervention ended and the Party introduced NEP, it described it as a new eco-nomic policy because this policy had been interrupted by the intervention and we were in a position to apply it only after the intervention, after war communism,compared with which NEP really was a new economic policy. 
 In confirmation of this, I consider it necessary to refer to the resolution of the Ninth Congress of Soviets,where it is stated in black and white that the principles of the New Economic Policy were laid down before war communism. 
 This resolution, “Preliminary Results of theNew Economic Policy,” says the following: “What is known as the New Economic Policy, the basic principles of which were precisely defined already at the time of the first respite , in the spring of 1918 ,* is based on a strict evalua-tion of the economic resources of Soviet Russia. 
 The implementa-tion of this policy, which was interrupted by the combined attackof the counter-revolutionary forces of the Russian landlords andbourgeoisie and European imperialism on the workers’ and peas-ants’ state, became possible only after the armed suppressionof the counter-revolutionary attempts, at the beginning of 1921”(see Resolutions of the Ninth All-Russian Congress of Soviets , p. 
 16 47). 
 You will thus see how mistaken is the assertion of some comrades that it was only after war communism that the Party realised the necessity for building social-ism in the conditions of a market and a money economy, * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 that is, in the conditions of the New Economic Policy. 
 And what follows from this? It follows, first of all, that NEP cannot be regard-ed as only a retreat. 
 It follows, further, that NEP presumes a victorious and systematic socialist offensive on the capitalist ele-ments in our economy. 
 The opposition, in the shape of Trotsky, thinks that once NEP has been introduced, only one thing re-mains for us to do, and that is to retreat step by step, as we retreated at the beginning of NEP, “ex-tending” NEP and surrendering positions. 
 It is onthis incorrect conception of NEP that Trotsky bases his assertion that the Party “extended” NEP and retreat-ed from Lenin’s position by permitting the renting ofland and the hiring of labour in the countryside. 
 Please listen to Trotsky’s words: “But what is the significance of the Soviet Government’s latest measures in the countryside—sanctioning the renting of land and the hiring of labour—all that which we call extending rural NEP. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 But could we have abstained from extending NE P in the countryside? No, because then peasant farming would have fallen into decay, the market would have narrowed, and industry would have been retarded” (Trotsky, Eight Years , pp. 
 16-17). 
 That is the length to which one may go if one gets into one’s head the mistaken notion that NEP is a retreat and nothing but a retreat. 
 Can it be asserted that, in permitting the hiring of labour and the renting of land in the countryside, the Party “extended” NEP, “retreated” from Lenin’s posi-tion and so on? Of course not! People who talk such non-sense have nothing in common with Lenin and Leninism. 
 I might refer to Lenin’s letter to Ossinsky of April 1, 1922, where he speaks explicitly of the necessity of permitting the hiring of labour and the renting of landin the countryside. 
 That was towards the end of the Elev-enth Party Congress, where the question of work in the countryside, of NEP and its consequences had beenwidely discussed by the delegates. 
 Here is a quotation from this letter, forming the draft of a resolution for the delegates at the Party con-gress: “On the question of the conditions for permitting the hiring of labour in agriculture and the renting of land, the Party Con-gress recommends all functionaries engaged in this field not to hamper either of these trends with excessive formalities, and to confine themselves to carrying out the decision of the last congress of Soviets, and also to studying what practical measures would be expedient in order to restrict the possibility of extremes and harmful excesses in this matter” (see Lenin Miscellany , IV , p. 
 39648). 
 You see how foolish and baseless is the talk about an “extension” of NEP, about a “retreat” from Lenin’s position in connection with the introduction of the renting of land and the hiring of labour in the country-side, etc. 
 Why do I speak of this? Because the people who are talking about an “exten-sion” of NEP are seeking to use this talk as a justifica-tion for retreating in face of the capitalist elements in the countryside. 
 Because people have arisen inside and around our Party who see in the “extension” of NEP a means of “saving” the bond between the workers and the peasants,people who, on the grounds of the repeal of the emergency measures, demand that the restrictions on the kulaks be discarded, and who demand that the capitalist elements in the countryside be given a free hand—in the interestsof the bond. 
 Because the Party must be safeguarded against these anti-proletarian sentiments by all ways and means inour power. 
 Not to go too far afield, I shall refer to a note from a comrade, Osip Chernov, a member of the staff ofBednota , 49 in which he demands a series of relaxations for the kulaks, relaxations which would be nothing but a real and undisguised “extension” of NEP. 
 I do notknow whether he is a Communist or not. 
 But this com-rade, Osip Chernov, who is a supporter of the Soviet regime and of the alliance between the workers and thepeasants, is so muddled over the peasant question that it is difficult to distinguish him from an ideologist of the rural bourgeoisie. 
 What, in his opinion, are thereasons for our difficulties on the grain front? “The first reason,” he says, “is unquestionably the progressive income tax system. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 The second reason is the legalchanges in the election regulations, the lack of clarity in the regulations as to who is to be regarded as a kulak. 
” What must be done to remove the difficulties? “It is necessary in the first place,” he says, “ to abolish the progressive income tax system as it now stands, and re-place it by a land taxation system, and to put a lighttax on draught animals and major agricultural imple-ments. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 A second, and no less important, measure is to revise the election regulations , so as to make more prominent the signs showing where an exploiting, ku-lak farm begins. 
” There you have the “extension” of NEP. 
 As you see, the seed cast by Trotsky has not fallen on barren soil. 
 Incorrect understanding of NEP gives rise to talk about“extension” of NEP, and talk about “extension” of NEP results in all sorts of notes, articles, letters and proposals recommending that the kulak should be al-lowed a free hand, that he should be relieved of restrictions and enabled to enrich himself without hindrance. 
 In reference to this same question, the question of NEP and the class struggle under NEP conditions, I should like to mention another fact. 
 I am referring to the statement made by one of the comrades to the effectthat, in connection with the grain procurements, the class struggle under NEP is only of minor impor-tance, that this class struggle is not and cannot be ofany serious importance in our grain procurement diffi-culties. 
 I must say, comrades, that I cannot at all agree with this statement. 
 I think that, under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is not and cannot be a single polit-ical or economic fact of any importance which does notreflect the existence of a class struggle in town or coun-try. 
 Does NEP abolish the dictatorship of the proletar-iat? Of course not! On the contrary, NEP is a specificform of expression and an instrument of the dicta-torship of the proletariat. 
 And is not the dictatorship of the proletariat a continuation of the class struggle?(Voices : “True!”) How, then, can it be said that the class struggle plays only a minor role in such important po-litical and economic facts as the kulaks’ attack on So-viet policy at the time of the grain procurements and the counter-measures and offensive actions undertaken by the Soviet Government against the kulaks and specula-tors in connection with the grain procurements? Is it not a fact that at the time of the grain procure-ment crisis we had the first serious attack by the capitalist elements of the countryside on Soviet policy under NEP conditions? Have classes and the class struggle ceased to exist in the countryside? Is it not true that Lenin’s slogan about relying o n the poor peasant, an alliance with the middle peasant and fighting against the kulaks is the basic slogan of our work in the countryside under the present condi-tions? And what is this slogan if not an expression of the class struggle in the countryside? Of course, our policy must by no means be regarded as a policy of fanning the class struggle. 
 Why? Because fanning the class struggle would lead to civil war. 
 Be-cause, inasmuch as we are in power, and inasmuch as wehave consolidated our power and the key positions are in the hands of the working class, it is not in our interest that the class struggle should assume the forms of civilwar. 
 But this in no way implies that the class struggle has been abolished, or that it will not grow sharper. 
 Still less does it imply that the class struggle is not thedecisive factor in our advancement. 
 No, it does not. 
 We often say that we are promoting socialist forms of economy in the sphere of trade. 
 But what does thatimply? It implies that we are squeezing out of trade thousands upon thousands of small and medium traders. 
 Is it to be expected that these traders who have beensqueezed out of the sphere of trade will keep silent and not attempt to organise resistance? Obviously not. 
 We often say that we are promoting socialist forms of economy in the sphere of industry. 
 But what does that imply? It implies that, by our advance towardssocialism, we are squeezing out and ruining, perhaps without ourselves noticing it, thousands upon thousands of small and medium capitalist manufacturers. 
 Is it tobe expected that these ruined people will keep silent and not attempt to organise resistance? Of course not. 
 We often say that it is necessary to restrict the ex-ploiting proclivities of the kulaks in the countryside, that they must be heavily taxed and the right to rent land limited, that kulaks must not be allowed the rightto vote in the election of Soviets, and so on and so forth. 
 But what does that imply? It implies that we are gradu-ally pressing upon and squeezing out the capitalist ele-ments in the countryside, sometimes driving them to ruin. 
 Is it to be presumed that the kulaks will be grate-ful to us for this and will not endeavour to organise partof the poor peasants or middle peasants against the So-viet Government’s policy? Of course not. 
 Is it not obvious that our whole forward movement, our every success of any importance in the sphere of socialist construction, is an expression and result of the class struggle in our country? But it follows from all this that the more we ad-vance, the greater will be the resistance of the capital-ist elements and the sharper the class struggle, whilethe Soviet Government, whose strength will steadily in-crease, will pursue a policy of isolating these elements, a policy of demoralising the enemies of the workingclass, a policy, lastly, of crushing the resistance of the exploiters, thereby creating a basis for the further advance of the working class and the main mass of the peasantry. 
 It must not be imagined that the socialist forms will develop, squeezing out the enemies of the working class, while our enemies retreat in silence and make way for our advance, that then we shall again advance and theywill again retreat until “unexpectedly” all the social groups without exception, both kulaks and poor peasants, both workers and capitalists, find themselves “sudden-ly” and “imperceptibly,” without struggle or commo-tion, in the lap of a socialist society. 
 Such fairy-tales do not and cannot happen in general, and in the conditionsof the dictatorship of the proletariat in particular. 
 It never has been and never will be the case that a dying class surrenders its positions voluntarily with-out attempting to organise resistance. 
 It never has been and never will be the case that the working class could advance towards socialism in a class society withoutstruggle or commotion. 
 On the contrary, the advance towards socialism cannot but cause the exploiting ele-ments to resist the advance, and the resistance of theexploiters cannot but lead to the inevitable sharpening of the class struggle. 
 That is why the working class must not be lulled with talk about the class struggle playing a secondary role. 
 The fourth question concerns the problem of emergen-cy measures against the kulaks and speculators. 
 Emergency measures must not be regarded as some-thing absolute and established once for all. 
 Emergencymeasures are necessary and expedient in definite, emer-gency circumstances, when no other means of manoeuvr-ing are available. 
 Emergency measures are unnecessary and harmful in other circumstances, when other, flex-ible means of manoeuvring in the market are available. 
Those who think that emergency measures are a bad thing in all circumstances are mistaken. 
 A systematic struggle must be waged against such people. 
 But mistak-en, too, are those who think that emergency measures are necessary and expedient at all times. 
 A resolute struggle against such people is essential. 
 Was it a mistake to resort to emergency measures in the conditions of the grain procurement crisis? It is now recognised by all that it was not a mistake, that,on the contrary, the emergency measures saved the country from a crisis of our whole economy. 
 What induced us to resort to these measures? The deficit of 128,000,000poods of grain by January of this year, which we had to make good before the roads were spoiled by the spring thaws, at the same time ensuring a normal rate of grainprocurement. 
 Could we refrain from resorting to emer-gency measures in the absence of a reserve of about 100,000,000 poods of grain essential for being able tohold out and to intervene in the market with the object of reducing grain prices, or in the absence of an ade-quate reserve of foreign currency essential for importinglarge quantities of grain from abroad? Obviously, we could not. 
 And what would have happened if we had not made good this deficit? We should now be having a mostserious crisis of our entire national economy, hunger in the towns and hunger in the army. 
 If we had had a reserve of about 100,000,000 poods of grain with which to hold out and then wear down the kulak by intervening in the market with a view to reducing grain prices, we should not, of course, have re-sorted to emergency measures. 
 But you know very well that we had no such reserve. 
 If at that time we had had a foreign currency reserve of 100,000,000 or 150,000,000 rubles with which to import grain from abroad, most likely we should not have re-sorted to emergency measures. 
 But you know very well that we had no such reserve. 
 Does that mean that we should continue to remain without a reserve in the future and again resort to the aid of emergency measures? No, it does not. 
 On the con-trary, we must do everything in our power to accumu-late reserves and to rule out completely the necessity of resorting to any emergency measures. 
 People who contemplate converting the emergency measures into apermanent or prolonged policy of our Party are danger-ous, because they are playing with fire and are a source of danger to the bond. 
 Does it follow from this that we must renounce once for all resort to emergency measures? No, it does not. 
 We have no grounds for asserting that emergency cir-cumstances necessitating resort to emergency measures will never recur. 
 To assert that would be sheer quackery. 
 Lenin demonstrated the necessity for the New Eco-nomic Policy; yet he did not consider it possible under NEP to renounce resort even to the methods of the Poor Peasants’ Committees in certain conditions and undercertain circumstances. 
 Still less can we renounce once for all resort to emergency measures, which cannot be put on a par with so drastic a measure for combatingthe kulaks as the methods of the Poor Peasants’ Com-mittees. 
 It may not be superfluous to recall an incident in-volving Preobrazhensky at the Eleventh Congress of our Party that has a direct bearing on the matter inhand. 
 You know that at the Eleventh Congress in his theses on work in the countryside Preobrazhensky at-tempted to reject “once for all” under NEP conditions thepolicy of combating the kulaks by the methods of the Poor Peasants’ Committees. 
 Preobrazhensky wrote in his theses: “The policy of repudiating this stratum (the kulaks andwell-to-do peasants) and of gross extra-economic suppres-sion of it by the methods of the Poor Peasants’ Commit-tees of 1918 would be a most harmful mistake” (§2). 
 You know that Lenin replied to this as follows: “The second sentence of the second paragraph (directed against the methods of the Poor Peasants’ Committees’) is harmful and wrong, since war, for example, might compel us to resort to the methods of the Poor Peasants ’ Committees . 
 This should be spo-ken of quite differently—in this way, for example: in view of the paramount importance of improving agriculture and increasing its output, the policy of the proletariat towards the kulaks and well-to-do peasants at the present moment * should aim chiefly at r e s t r i c t i n g their exploiting efforts, and so forth. 
 The whole point lies in the ways and means by which our state can and should restrict those efforts and protect the poor peasants. 
 This must be studied and we must see to it that it is studied prac-tically, but general phrases are f u t i l e” (see Lenin Miscellany , IV , p. 
 39150). 
 Clearly, emergency measures must be regarded dia-lectically, for everything depends on the conditions of time and place.

 St. 
 That, comrades, is how matters stand with the ques-tions of a general character that arose in the course of the discussion. 
 Allow me to pass now to the question of the grain problem and the basic causes of our difficulties on the grain front . 
 I think that a number of comrades have committed the error of lumping together different kinds of causes of our difficulties on the grain front, of confusing tem-porary and circumstantial (specific) causes with chron-ic and fundamental causes. 
 There are two sets of causes of our grain difficulties: chronic, fundamental causes,the elimination of which will require a number of years, and specific, circumstantial causes, which can be elimi-nated now, if a number of necessary measures are adoptedand carried out. 
 To lump all these causes together is to confuse the whole question. 
 What is the underlying significance of our difficul-ties on the grain front? It is that they confront us square-ly with the problem of grain, of grain production, with the problem of agriculture in general, and of cereal pro-duction in particular. 
 Do we have a grain problem at all, as an urgent ques-tion? We undoubtedly do. 
 One must be blind to doubtthat the grain problem is now harassing every aspect of Soviet social life. 
 We cannot live like gypsies, without grain reserves, without certain reserves in case of har-vest failure, without reserves with which to manoeuvre in the market, without reserves against the contingency of war, and, lastly, without some reserves for export. 
 Eventhe small peasant, for all the meagreness of his husband-ry, cannot do without reserves, without certain stocks. 
 Is it not clear that a great country covering one-sixth of the world cannot do without grain reserves for its in-ternal and external requirements? Supposing the winter crop in the Ukraine had not perished and we had ended the grain procurement year just “breaking even”—could this have been consideredenough? No, it could not. 
 We cannot continue to live just “breaking even. 
” We must have at our disposal a cer-tain minimum of reserves if we want to uphold the po-sition of the Soviet Government both internally and ex-ternally. 
 Firstly, we are not guaranteed against armed attack. 
 Do you think we can defend the country if we have no reserves of grain for the army? Those comrades were perfectly right who said here that the peasant today is not whathe was six years ago, say, when he was afraid that he might lose his land to the landlord. 
 The peasant is al-ready forgetting the landlord. 
 He is now demanding newand better conditions of life. 
 Can we, in the event of ene-my attack, wage war against the external enemy on the battle front, and at the same time against the mu-zhik in the rear in order to get grain urgently for the ar-my? No, we cannot and must not. 
 In order to defend the country, we must have certain stocks for supplying thearmy, if only for the first six months. 
 Why do we need this six-months’ breathing space? In order to give the peasant time to awaken to the situation, to realise thedanger of the war, to see how matters stand and to be ready to do his bit for the common cause of the country’s defence. 
 If we content ourselves with just “breakingeven,” we shall never have reserves against the contin-gency of war. 
 Secondly, we are not guaranteed against complica-tions in the grain market. 
 A certain reserve is absolute-ly essential to enable us to intervene in the grain marketand make our price policy effective. 
 For we cannot, and must not, resort every time to emergency measures. 
 But we shall never have such a reserve if we alwaysfind ourselves on the edge of a precipice and are con-tent if we can end the procurement year just “breaking even. 
” Thirdly, we are not guaranteed against crop failure. 
 A certain grain reserve is absolutely essential to enable us in the event of crop failure to supply the famineareas at least to some extent and at least for some time. 
 But we shall not have such a reserve if we do not increase the production of marketable grain and do not posi-tively and decisively abandon the old habit of living with-out reserves. 
 Lastly, a reserve is absolutely essential to enable us to export grain. 
 We have to import equipment for industry. 
 We have to import agricultural machines, trac-tors and spare parts for them. 
 But this cannot be doneif we do not export grain, if we do not accumulate a cer-tain reserve of foreign currency obtained by exporting grain. 
 Before the war we used to export from 500,000,000to 600,000,000 poods of grain annually. 
 We were able to export so much because we went short ourselves. 
 That is true. 
 It should, however, be realised that all thesame our marketable grain before the war was double what it is today. 
 And it is just because we have now only half as much marketable grain that grain is ceasingto be an item of export. 
 And what does ceasing to ex-port grain mean? It means losing the source which ena-bled us to import—as we must import—equipment for industry and tractors and machines for agriculture. 
 Can we go on living in this way—without accumulating grainreserves for export? No, we cannot. 
 So you see how insecure and unstable our position in the matter of grain reserves is. 
 This is apart from the fact that not only have we no grain reserves for all these four purposes; we have not even a minimum reserve to enable us to carry over with-out distress from one procurement year to the next and to supply the towns uninterruptedly in such difficult months as June and July. 
 Can it then be denied that the grain problem is acute and that our difficulties on the grain front are serious? But, because of our grain difficulties, we are also having difficulties of a political character. 
 Under no circumstances must this be forgotten, comrades. 
 I am referring to the discontent which was to be observedamong a certain section of the peasantry, among a certain section of the poor peasants, and also of the middle peasants, and which created a certain threat to thebond. 
 Of course, it would be quite wrong to say, as Frum-kin does in his note, that there is already an estrange-ment instead of the bond. 
 That is not true, comrades. 
 An estrangement would be a serious thing. 
 An estrange-ment would mean the beginning of civil war, if not civ-il war itself. 
 Don’t let us frighten ourselves with “ter-rible” words. 
 Don’t let us give way to panic. 
 That would be unworthy of Bolsheviks. 
 An estrangement wouldmean that the peasantry had broken with the Soviet Government. 
 But if the peasant really had broken with the Soviet Government, which is the chief purchaser of peasant grain , he would not be enlarging his crop area. 
 Yet we find that this year the spring crop area has beenenlarged in all the grain areas without exception . 
 Does that look like estrangement? Can one call this state of things a “hopeless prospect” for peasant farming, asFrumkin, for example, says it is? Does that look like a “hopeless prospect”? What is the basis of our grain difficulties, mean-ing by that the chronic and fundamental causes of the difficulties, and not the temporary, circumstantial ones? The basis of our grain difficulties lies in the increas-ingly scattered and divided character of agriculture . 
 It is a fact that agriculture, especially grain farming,is growing smaller in scale, becoming increasingly less remunerative and less productive of marketable surpluses. 
 Whereas before the revolution we had about15,000,000 or 16,000,000 peasant farms, now we have some 24,000,000 or 25,000,000; moreover, the process of division tends to become more marked. 
 It is true that our crop area today falls little short of pre-war, and that the gross output of grain is only some five per cent less than it was before the war. 
 But the trou-ble is that, in spite of all this, our output of market-able grain is only half, that is, about 50 per cent, of pre-war. 
 That is the root of the matter. 
 What is the point? The point is that small-scale farm-ing is less remunerative, produces smaller market-able surpluses and is less stable than large-scale farming. 
The Marxist thesis that small-scale production is less profitable than large-scale production fully applies to agriculture also. 
 That is why, from one and the same area, small-scale peasant farming yields much less marketable grain than large-scale farming. 
 What is the way out of this situation? There are three ways, as the Political Bureau resolu-tion tells us. 
 1. 
 The way out is to raise the productivity of small-and middle-peasant farming as far as possible, to replace the wooden plough by the steel plough, to supply smalland medium machines, fertiliser, seed and agronomic help, to organise the peasantry into co-operatives, to conclude contracts with whole villages, supplying themwith the best-grade seed on loan and thus ensuring the peasants collective credit, and, lastly, to place big ma-chines at their disposal through machine-hiring stations. 
 Those comrades are mistaken who assert that small-peasant farming has exhausted its potentialities for fur-ther development, and that therefore it is not worthwhile to give it any further help. 
 That is quite untrue. 
 Individual peasant farming still possesses no inconsid-erable potentialities for development. 
 One only has toknow how to help it to realise these potentialities. 
 Nor is Krasnaya Gazeta 51 right in asserting that the policy of organising the individual peasant farms insupply and marketing co-operatives has not justified itself. 
 That is quite untrue, comrades. 
 On the contrary, the policy of organising supply and marketing co-operativeshas justified itself fully, by creating a real basis among the peasantry for a swing towards the side of the collective-farm movement. 
 There is no doubt that if we had notdeveloped supply and marketing co-operatives, we should not have that swing in the attitude of the peasantry towards collective farming which now exists, and which is helping us to lead the collective-farm movement forward. 
 2. 
 The way out, further, is to help the poor and mid-dle peasants gradually to unite their scattered small farms into large collective farms based on new technicalequipment and collective labour, as being more profit-able and yielding larger marketable surpluses. 
 I have in mind all forms of uniting small farms intolarge, socially-conducted farms, from simple co-operatives to artels, which are incomparably more productive and yield far larger marketable surpluses than the scatteredsmall-peasant farms. 
 That is the basis for the solution of the problem. 
 Comrades are mistaken when, while advocating col-lective farms, they accuse us of “rehabilitating” small-peasant farming. 
 They evidently think that the attitude towards the individual peasant farms should be one offighting and destroying them, and not of assisting them and drawing them over to our side. 
 That is quite wrong, comrades. 
 Individual peasant farming is in no need of“rehabilitation. 
” It is not very remunerative, it is true. 
 But that does not mean that it is altogether unprofita-ble. 
 We should be destroying the bond if we adoptedthe attitude of fighting and destroying individual peas-ant farming, departing from the Leninist position that the collective farms must render day-to-day assistanceand support to the individual peasant farms. 
 Even more mistaken are those who, while extolling the collective farms, declare that individual peasantfarming is our “curse. 
” This already smacks of down-right war on peasant farming. 
 Where do they get this /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR idea from? If peasant farming is a “curse,” how do they explain the alliance of the working class and the main mass of the peasantry? Alliance of the working classwith a “curse”—can there be anything so fantastic? How can they say such things and at the same time preach in favour of the bond? They recall what Lenin saidabout the necessity of our gradually changing over from the peasant nag to the steel steed of industry. 
 That is very good. 
 But is that the way to change over from onehorse to another? To proclaim peasant farming a “curse” before a broad and powerful base has been created in the shape of a ramified system of collective farms—wouldnot the upshot be that we should be left without any horse, without any base at all? ( Voices : “Quite right!”) The mistake of these comrades is that they counterpose collective farming to individual peasant farming. 
 But what we want is that these two forms of farming should not be counterposed to one another, but should belinked together in a bond , and that within the framework of this bond the collective farms should assist the indi-vidual peasant and help him little by little to go overto collectivist lines. 
 Yes, what we want is that the peas-ants should look upon the collective farms not as their enemy, but as their friend who helps them and willhelp them to emancipate themselves from poverty. 
 (Voices : “True!”) If that is true, then you should not say that we are “rehabilitating” individual peasantfarming, or that peasant farming is our “curse. 
” What should be said is that, compared with the big collective farm, the small-peasant farm is less profit-able, or even the least profitable, but that all the same it is of some, not inconsiderable, benefit. 
 But from what you say it follows that small-peasant farming is altogeth-er unprofitable, and perhaps even harmful. 
 That was not Lenin’s opinion of small-peasant farm-ing. 
 Here is what he said on this score in his speech on “The Tax in Kind”: “If peasant farming can develop further, we must firmly assure its transition to the next stage too, and this transition to the next stage will inevitably consist in the small, isolated peas-ant farms, the least profitable and most backward, gradually uniting to form socially-conducted, large farms. 
 That is how Socialists have always conceived it. 
 And that is how our Communist Party conceives it” (V ol. 
 XXVI, p. 
 299). 
 It follows that individual peasant farming is after all of some benefit. 
 It is one thing when a higher form of enterprise, large-scale enterprise, contends against a lower form and ruins, kills it. 
 That is what happens under capitalism. 
It is quite another thing when the higher form of enter-prise does not ruin the lower form, but helps it to raiseitself, to go over to collectivist lines. 
 That is whathappens under the Soviet system. 
 And here is what Lenin says about the relations be-tween the collective farms and the individual peasantfarms: “In particular, we must see to it that the law of the Soviet Government (on collective farms and state farms— J. 
 St. 
 ) requir-ing that the state farms, agricultural communes and similar associations should render immediate and all-round assistance to the surrounding middle peasants , is actually, and moreover fully, carried out. 
 Only if such assistance is in fact rendered is agreement with the middle peasant feasible . 
* Only in this way can, and should, his confidence be won” (V ol. 
 XXIV , p. 
 175). 
 * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 It follows from this that the collective farms and state farms must assist the peasant farms precisely asindividual farms. 
 Lastly, a third quotation from Lenin: “Only if we succeed in practice in showing the peasants the advantages of common, collective, co-operative, artel cultivation of the soil, only if we succeed in helping the peasant by means of co-operative, artel farming, will the working class, which holds state power in its hands, actually prove to the peasant the correctness of its policy and actually secure the real and durable following of the vast masses of the peasantry” (V ol. 
 XXIV , p. 
 579). 
 You see how highly Lenin appreciated the value of the collective-farm movement for the socialist trans-formation of our country. 
 It is extremely strange that some comrades in their long speeches focussed attention exclusively on the ques-tion of the individual peasant farms and did not saya single word, literally not a single word, about the taskof promoting collective farms, as an urgent and decisivetask of our Party. 
 3. 
 The way out, lastly, is to strengthen the old state farms and to promote new, large state farms, as be-ing the economic units that are the most remunerative and yield the largest marketable surpluses. 
 Such are the three principal tasks, the accomplish-ment of which will enable us to solve the grain problem,and thus do away with the very basis of our difficultieson the grain front. 
 The specific feature of the present moment is that the first task, that of improving individual peasant farm-ing, although it still remains our chief task, is already insufficient for the solution of the grain problem. 
 The specific feature of the present moment is that the first task must be supplemented in practice by the two new tasks of promoting collective farms and pro-moting state farms. 
 Unless we combine these tasks, unless we work per-sistently along all these three channels, it will be impos-sible to solve the grain problem, whether in the sense of supplying the country with marketable grain or in the sense of transforming our entire national economy onsocialist lines. 
 What was Lenin’s view of this matter? We have a document which shows that the Political Bureau res-olution submitted to this plenum fully coincides with the practical plan for the development of agriculturewhich Lenin outlined in this document. 
 I am referring to the “Mandate of the C. 
L. 
D. 
” (Council of Labour and Defence) written in Lenin’s own hand. 
 It was publishedin May 1921. 
 In this document Lenin analyses three groups of practical questions: the first group concerns trade and industry, the second group concerns the pro-motion of agriculture, and the third group concerns the various economic councils 52 and regional conferences on the regulation of economic affairs. 
 What does this document say on the subject of agri-culture? Here is a quotation from the “Mandate of the C. 
L. 
D. 
”: “Second group of questions. 
 Promotion of agriculture: a) peas-ant farming, b) state farms, c) communes, d) artels, e) co-opera-tives, f) other forms of socially-conducted farming” (see V ol. 
 XXVI, p. 
 374). 
 You will see that the practical conclusions contained in the Political Bureau resolution on the solution of the grain problem, and of the agricultural problem in general, fully coincide with Lenin’s plan as set forth in the “Mandate of the C. 
L. 
D. 
” of 1921. 
 It was very interesting to observe the truly youth-ful joy with which that giant, Lenin, who could move mountains and bring them face to face, greeted everyitem of news of the formation of a couple or so of collec-tive farms, or of the arrival of tractors in some state farm. 
 Here, for instance, is an excerpt from a letter tothe Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia: “Dear Comrades, extremely gratifying reports have appeared in our newspapers regarding the work of members of your Society in the state farms of the Kirsanov Uyezd, Tambov Gubernia, and at Mitino Station, Odessa Gubernia, as well as regardingthe work of a group of miners from the Donets Basin. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 I am applying to the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee requesting that the most outstanding farms shouldbe classed as model farms and rendered special and priority as-sistance necessary for the favourable development of their work. 
 I once more profoundly thank you in the name of our Republic,and request you to bear in mind that your assistance to us in the way of tractor cultivation of the soil is especially timely and valuable. 
 I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity of congratulating you on your project to organise 200 agricultural communes” (V ol. 
 XXVII, p. 
 309). 
 And here is an excerpt from a letter to the Society of Friends of Soviet Russia in America: “Dear Comrades: I have just verified by a special request to the Perm Executive Committee, the extraordinary favourable news published in our press with reference to the work of the mem-bers of your Society headed by Harold Ware and organised as a Tractor Unit, in the Government of Perm, on a Soviet Farm * * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 ‘Toykino. 
’ . 
 . 
 . 
 I am appealing to the Presidium of the All-Rus-sian Central Executive Committee to place this Soviet Farm in the ranks of Model Farms and to render it in every possible way special and extraordinary assistance in its constructive work, as well as supplying it with gasoline, metals and other material necessary for the organisation of a Repair Shop. 
 Once more, I wish to thank you in the name of our Republic and to point out that no other form of relief is so timely and so important for us as the one rendered by you”* (V ol. 
 XXVII, p. 
 308). 
 So you see with what joy Lenin received every item of news, however small, regarding the development of collective farms and state farms. 
 Let this be a lesson to all who think they can de-ceive history and dispense with collective farms and state farms in victoriously building socialism in ourcountry. 
 I am concluding, comrades. 
 I think that the grain difficulties will not have been without their value forus. 
 Our Party has learned and progressed by overcoming difficulties and crises of every kind. 
 I think that the pres-ent difficulties will steel our Bolshevik ranks and in-duce them to tackle the solution of the grain problem in thorough fashion. 
 And the solution of this problem will remove one of the biggest difficulties standing in the wayof the socialist transformation of our country.

 ON THE BOND BETWEEN THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS AND ON STATE FARMS From a Speech Delivered on July 11, 1928 Some of the comrades reverted in their speeches on the state farms to yesterday’s dispute on the question of the grain procurements. 
 Well, let us revert to yester-day’s dispute. 
 What was the dispute about yesterday? First of all, about the “scissors” between town and country. 
 It was said that the peasant was still overpaying for manufac-tured goods and being underpaid for his agricultural produce. 
 It was said that these overpayments and under-payments constitute a supertax on the peasantry, some-thing in the nature of a “tribute,” an additional tax for the sake of industrialisation, a tax which we must certainly abolish, but which we cannot abolish at once if we have no intention of undermining our industry, of undermining a definite rate of development of our in-dustry, which works for the whole country and whichadvances our national economy towards socialism. 
 There were some who did not like this. 
 These com-rades apparently fear to admit the truth. 
 Well, that isa matter of taste. 
 Some think that it is not advisable to tell the whole truth at a plenum of the Central Committee. 
 But I think that at the plenum of the Central Committeeof our Party it is our duty to tell the whole truth. 
 It should not be forgotten that the plenum of the Central Committee cannot be regarded as a mass meeting. 
 Of course, “supertax,” “additional tax” are unpleasant words,for they hit hard. 
 But, in the first place, it is not a question of words. 
 In the second place, the words fully correspond to the facts. 
 In the third place, they, theseunpleasant words, are intended to hit hard and to compel Bolsheviks to set to work seriously to do away with this “supertax,” to do away with the “scissors. 
” And how can these unpleasant things be done away with? By systematically rationalising our industry and lowering prices of manufactured goods. 
 By syste-matically improving agricultural technique and rais-ing harvest yields, and gradually lowering the cost of agricultural produce. 
 By systematically rationalisingour trade and procurement apparatus. 
 And so on and so forth. 
 All this, of course, cannot be done in a year or two. 
 But it has to be done without fail in the course of a few years if we want to save ourselves from all sorts of un-pleasant things and from facts that hit us hard. 
 Some of the comrades yesterday pressed hard for the abolition of the “scissors” at once and as good as demand-ed the establishment of replacement prices for agricul-tural produce. 
 I, as well as other comrades, objected to this and said that this demand was contrary to the interests of the industrialisation of the country at the present moment , and, consequently, was contrary to the interests of our state. 
 That is what our dispute was about yesterday. 
Today, these comrades say that they no longer in- sist on a policy of replacement prices. 
 Well, that is very good. 
 It appears that yesterday’s criticism was not with-out effect on these comrades. 
 A second question concerns the collective farms and state farms. 
 I remarked in my speech that it was unnat-ural and strange that, when speaking of measures for promoting agriculture in connection with the grain pro-curements, some comrades did not say a single word about such weighty measures as developing collective farms and state farms. 
 How is it possible to “forget” sucha serious thing as the task of developing collective and state farms in agriculture? Do we not know that the task of developing individual peasant farming, importantthough it is at the present moment, is already insuffi-cient , and that if we do not supplement this task in prac-tice with the new tasks of developing collective farmsand state farms, we shall not solve the grain farming problem and shall not escape from our difficulties, ei-ther in the sense of the socialist transformation of our entirenational economy (and, hence, of peasant farming), or in the sense of ensuring the country definite reserves of marketable grain. 
 In view of all this, how can the question of develop-ing collective farms and state farms be “forgotten,” evad-ed, passed over in silence? Let us pass now to the question of large state farms. 
 The comrades who assert that there are no large grain farms in North America are mistaken. 
 Inpoint of fact, there are such farms both in North and South America. 
 I might quote such a witness as Professor Tulaikov, who made a study of American agriculture andpublished his findings in the magazine Nizhneye Povol-zhye 53 (No. 
 9) Permit me to quote from Tulaikov’s article. 
 “The Montana wheat farm is owned by the Campbell Farming Corporation. 
 It has an area of 95,000 acres, or about32,000 dessiatins. 
 The farm is one continuous tract, divided forpurposes of operation into four sections, what we would call khutors, each of which has a separate manager, the whole farm being managed by one person, the director of the corpora-tion, Thomas Campbell. 
 “This year, according to a press report, which emanates of course from the farm itself, about half the total area is under culti-vation, and it is expected to secure about 410,000 bushels of wheat (about 800,000 poods). 
 20,000 bushels of oats and 70,000 bushels of linseed. 
 The income from the enterprise is expectedto total 500,000 dollars. 
 “On this farm, horses and mules are almost totally replaced by tractors, motor lorries and automobiles. 
 Ploughing, plantingand all field work in general, and harvesting in particular, are carried on day and night, the fields at night being flood-lit to enable the machines to work. 
 Because of the vast extent of thefields, the machines can cover long distances without making aturn. 
 For instance, reaper-threshers with a 24-foot header, if thestate of the crops permits their use, travel 20 miles, that is, alittle over 30 versts. 
 Formerly, 40 horses and men would have been required for this work. 
 Four sheaf-binders are hitched to one tractor, and cover a strip 40 feet wide and 28 miles long, thatis, a distance of roughly 42 versts. 
 Binders are used if the grainis not dry enough to be threshed at the same time as it is reaped. 
In that case, the binding device is removed from the reapers andthe cut stalks are laid in rows with the help of a special conveyer. 
 The rows are left lying 24 or 48 hours, during which time the grain dries and the seeds of the weeds-cut together with it fall to theground. 
 After this, the grain is taken up with a reaper-thresherthe cutter of which has been replaced by an automatic liftingdevice which delivers the dried grain straight into the thresherdrum, The machine is operated by only two men, one driving the tractor and the other tending the thresher. 
 The grain pours straight from the thresher into six-ton trucks which carry it to the elevator, trains of ten trucks each being drawn by one tractor. 
 The report says that in this way from 16,000 to 20,000 bushels of grain are threshed daily” (see Nizhneye Povolzhye , No. 
 9, Sep-tember 1927, pp. 
 38-39). 
 There you have a description of one giant wheat farm of the capitalist type. 
 There are giant farms of this kind in both North and South America. 
 Some comrades said here that in the capitalist coun-tries conditions for the development of such giant farms are not always favourable, or not altogether favourable,and therefore such farms are sometimes divided up in-to smaller units ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 dessiatins each. 
 That is quite true. 
 These comrades conclude from this that large-scale grain farming has no future under Soviet conditions either. 
 There they are quite wrong. 
 These comrades evidently fail to understand, or do not see, the difference in conditions between the capital-ist system and the Soviet system. 
 Under capitalismthere is private ownership of land, and therefore absolute ground rent, which increases the cost of agricultural pro-duction and creates insuperable barriers to its seriousprogress. 
 Under the Soviet system, however, there is neither private ownership of land nor absolute ground rent, which cannot but lower the cost of agricultural produc-tion and, consequently, cannot but facilitate the ad-vance of large-scale agriculture along the road of technical and all other progress. 
 Furthermore, under capitalism the object of large grain farms is to obtain the maximum profit, or, at any rate, such a profit on capital as might correspond to whatis known as the average rate of profit, without which, generally speaking, they cannot carry on or exist at all. 
 This circumstance cannot but increase the cost of produc-tion, thereby creating the most serious obstacles to thedevelopment of large grain farms. 
 Under the Soviet system, on the other hand, large grain farms, being at the same time state farms, do not at all require fortheir development either the maximum profit or the average profit, but can content themselves with a mini-mum profit (and sometimes do without any profit atall for a while), and this, coupled with the absence of absolute ground rent, creates exceptionally favourable con-ditions for the development of large grain farms. 
 Lastly, whereas under capitalism there is no such thing as credit privileges or tax privileges for large grain farms, under the Soviet system, which is designedto give the utmost encouragement to socialist economy, such privileges exist and will continue to exist. 
 All these and similar factors create under the Soviet system (as distinct from the capitalist system) very fa-vourable conditions for promoting the development of state farms as large grain farms. 
 Finally, there is the question of the state farms and collective farms as strong points for strengthening the bond, as strong points for ensuring the leading role ofthe working class. 
 We need collective farms and state farms not only in order to ensure our long-range aim of the socialist transformation of the countryside. 
 Weneed collective farms and state farms also in order to have socialist economic strong points in the countryside at this moment , these points being necessary for strengthen-ing the bond and for ensuring the leading role of the working class within the framework of the bond. 
 Can we count at this very moment on being able to create and develop such strong points? I have no doubt that we can, and should. 
 Khlebotsentr54 reports that it has con-tracts with collective farms, artels and co-operatives, un-der which it is to receive from them 40,000,000 or 50,000,000 poods of grain. 
 As to the state farms, the datashow that this year our old and new state farms should provide another 25,000,000 or 30,000,000 poods of mar-ketable grain. 
 If we add to that the 30,000,000-35,000,000 poods that the agricultural co-operatives should obtain from the individual peasant farms with which they have con-tractual arrangements, we shall have a full guarantee of over 100,000,000 poods of grain capable of serving as a definite reserve, at any rate in the home market. 
 That,after all, is something. 
 There you have the first results given by our social-ist economic strong points in the countryside. 
 And what follows from this? It follows that those comrades are mistaken who think that the working class is powerless in the matter of defending its socialistpositions in the countryside, that only one thing remains for it to do, namely, endlessly to retreat and continuous-ly to surrender its positions to the capitalist elements. 
 No,comrades, that is not true. 
 The working class is not so weak in the countryside as might appear to a superficial observer. 
 That cheerless philosophy has nothing in com-mon with Bolshevism. 
 The working class has quite a number of economic strong points in the countryside, in the shape of state farms, collective farms, and supplyand marketing co-operatives, relying on which it can strengthen the bond with the countryside, isolate the kulak, and ensure its leadership. 
 The working class, lastly, has a number of political strong points in the countryside, in the shape of the Soviets, in the shape of the organ-ised poor peasants, and so on, relying on which it can strengthen its positions in the countryside. 
 Relying on these economic and political bases in the countryside, and utilising all the means and resources (key positions, etc. 
) at the disposal of the proletarian dictatorship, the Party and the Soviet Government canconfidently carry on the work of the socialist transfor-mation of the countryside, step by step strengthening the alliance of the working class and peasantry, andstep by step strengthening the leadership of the working class within that alliance. 
 Particular attention in this connection should be paid to work among the poor peasants. 
 It must be taken as a rule that, the better and more effective our work among the poor peasants is, the greater will be the pres-tige of the Soviet Government in the countryside, and, on the contrary, the worse our relations with the poor peasants are, the lower will be the prestige of the SovietGovernment. 
 We often speak of the alliance with the middle peas-ants. 
 But in our conditions in order to strengthen thisalliance a determined struggle must be waged against the kulaks, against the capitalist elements in the countryside. 
 The Fifteenth Congress of our Party was therefore quiteright when it issued the slogan of intensifying the of-fensive against the kulaks. 
 But can a successful struggle be waged against the kulaks if work among the poorpeasants is not intensified, if the poor peasants are not roused against the kulaks, if systematic aid is not ren-dered the poor peasants? Obviously not! The middle peasantry is a vacillating class. 
 If our relations with the poor peasants are bad, if the poor peasants are not yetan organised support of the Soviet Government, the ku-lak feels that he is strong, and the middle peasant swings towards the kulak. 
 And on the contrary: if our relationswith the poor peasants are good, if the poor peasants are an organised support of the Soviet Government, the kulak feels that he is in a state of siege, and themiddle peasant swings towards the working class. 
 That is why I think that it is one of the most vital immediate tasks of our Party to intensify the work amongthe poor peasants, to organise the rendering of systemat-ic assistance to the poor peasants, and, lastly, to turn the poor peasants themselves into an organised supportof the working class in the countryside.

U. 
(B. 
) July 13, 1928 Comrades, the plenum of the Central Committee which has just concluded concerned itself with two setsof questions. 
 The first set consists of questions relating to major problems of the Communist International in connectionwith the impending Sixth Congress. 
 The second set consists of questions relating to our constructive work in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 in the sphere of agri-culture—the grain problem and grain procurements— and in the sphere of providing a technical intelligent-sia, cadres of intellectuals coming from the ranks of theworking class, for our industry. 
 Let us begin with the first set of questions. 
 I THE COMINTERN 1. 
 MAJOR PROBLEMS OF THE SIXTH CONGRESS OF THE COMINTERN What are the major problems which confront the Sixth Congress of the Comintern at the present time? If one looks at the stage passed through between the Fifth and Sixth Congresses, it is necessary first of all to consider the contradictions which have ripened in this interval within the imperialist camp. 
 What are these contradictions?At the time of the Fifth Congress very little was said about the Anglo-American contradiction as the princi-pal one. 
 It was even the custom at that time to speakof an Anglo-American alliance. 
 On the other hand quite a lot was said about contradictions between Britain and France, between America and Japan, between the vic-tors and the vanquished. 
 The difference between that period and the present period is that, of the contradictions in the capitalist camp, that between American capitalismand British capitalism has become the principal one. 
 Whether you take the question of oil, which is of decisive importance both for the development of the capitalisteconomy and for purposes of war; whether you take the question of markets, which are of the utmost impor-tance for the life and development of world capitalism,because goods cannot be produced if there is no assured sale for them; whether you take the question of spheres of capital export, which is one of the most characteristicfeatures of the imperialist stage; or whether, lastly, you take the question of the lines of communication with markets or sources of raw material—you will find thatall these main questions drive towards one principal problem, the struggle between Britain and America for world hegemony. 
 Wherever America, a countrywhere capitalism is growing gigantically, tries to butt in—whether it be China, the colonies, South America, or Africa—everywhere she encounters formidable obsta-cles in the shape of Britain’s firmly established posi-tions. 
 This, of course, does not do away with the other contradictions in the capitalist camp: between Amer-ica and Japan, Britain and France, France and Italy,Germany and France and so on. 
 But it does mean that these contradictions are linked in one way or another with the principal contradiction, that between capital-ist Britain, whose star is declining, and capitalist Amer-ica, whose star is rising. 
 With what is this principal contradiction fraught? It is very likely fraught with war. 
 When two giants come into collision, when they find the earth too small for both of them, they strive to cross swords in order to decidetheir dispute over world hegemony by war. 
 That is the first thing to bear in mind. 
 A second contradiction is that between imperialism and the colonies. 
 This contradiction existed at the time of the Fifth Congress too. 
 But only now has it assumed an acute character. 
 We did not at that time have sucha powerful development of the revolutionary movement in China, such a powerful shaking up of the vast masses of the Chinese workers and peasants as occurred a yearago and as is occurring now. 
 And that is not all. 
 We did not at that time, at the time of the Fifth Congress of the Comintern, have that powerful stirring of the labourmovement and the national-liberation struggle in India which we have now. 
 These two major facts bring squarely to the fore the question of the colonies and semi-colonies. 
 With what is the growth of this contradiction fraught? It is fraught with national wars of liberation in the colonies and with intervention on the part of impe-rialism. 
 This circumstance also must be borne in mind. 
 There is, lastly, a third contradiction—that between the capitalist world and the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
, one that is grow-ing not less but more acute. 
 Whereas at the time ofthe Fifth Congress of the Comintern it could be said that a certain equilibrium, unstable, it is true, but more or less prolonged, had been established between the twoworlds, the two antipodes, the world of Soviets and the world of capitalism, now we have every ground for affirming that the days of this equilibrium are drawingto a close. 
 It goes without saying that the growth of this con-tradiction cannot fail to be fraught with the danger ofarmed intervention. 
 It is to be presumed that the Sixth Congress will take this circumstance also into consideration. 
 Thus all these contradictions inevitably lead to one principal danger—the danger of new imperialist wars and intervention. 
 Therefore, the danger of new imperialist wars and intervention is the main question of the day. 
 The most widespread method of lulling the working class and of diverting it from the struggle against the danger of war is present-day bourgeois pacifism, with its League of Nations, its preaching of “peace,” its “pro-hibition” of war, its talk of “disarmament” and so forth. 
 Many think that imperialist pacifism is an instru-ment of peace. 
 That is absolutely wrong. 
 Imperialistpacifism is an instrument for the preparation of war and for disguising this preparation by hypocritical talk of peace. 
 Without this pacifism and its instrument, theLeague of Nations, preparation for war in the conditions of today would be impossible. 
 There are naïve people who think that since there is imperialist pacifism, there will be no war. 
 That is quite untrue. 
 On the contrary, whoever wishes to get at thetruth must reverse this proposition and say: since impe-rialist pacifism and its League of Nations are flourishing, new imperialist wars and intervention are certain. 
 And the most important thing in all this is that Social-Democracy is the main channel of imperialist pac-ifism within the working class—consequently, it is cap-italism’s main support among the working class in pre-paring for new wars and intervention. 
 But for the preparation of new wars pacifism alone is not enough, even if it is supported by so serious a force as Social-Democracy. 
 For this, certain means of sup-pressing the masses in the imperialist centres are alsoneeded. 
 It is impossible to wage war for imperialism un-less the rear of imperialism is strengthened. 
 It is impos-sible to strengthen the rear of imperialism without sup-pressing the workers. 
 And that is what fascism is for. 
 Hence the growing acuteness of the inherent con-tradictions in the capitalist countries, the contradic-tions between labour and capital. 
 On the one hand, preaching of pacifism through the mouths of the Social-Democrats in order more effectivelyto prepare for new wars; on the other hand, suppression of the working class in the rear, of the Communist Parties in the rear, by the use of fascist methods, in order thento conduct war and intervention more effectively—such are the ways of preparing for new wars. 
 Hence the tasks of the Communist Parties:Firstly, to wage an unceasing struggle against So-cial-Democratism in all spheres—in the economic and in the political sphere, including in the latter the exposure of bourgeois pacifism with the task of winning the major-ity of the working class for communism. 
 Secondly, to form a united front of the workers of the advanced countries and the labouring masses of the colonies in order to stave off the danger of war, or, ifwar breaks out, to convert imperialist war into civil war, smash fascism, overthrow capitalism, establish So-viet power, emancipate the colonies from slavery, andorganise all-round defence of the first Soviet Republic in the world. 
 Such are the principal problems and tasks confront-ing the Sixth Congress. 
 These problems and tasks are being taken into ac-count by the Executive Committee of the Comintern,as you will easily see if you examine the agenda of the Sixth Congress of the Comintern. 
 2. 
 THE PROGRAMME OF THE COMINTERN Closely linked with the question of the main prob-lems of the international working-class movement is the question of the programme of the Comintern. 
 The cardinal significance of the programme of the Comintern is that it scientifically formulates the basic tasks of the communist movement, indicates the princi-pal means of accomplishing these tasks, and thus creates for the Comintern sections that clarity of aims and methods without which it is impossible to move for-ward with confidence. 
 A few words about the specific features of the draft programme of the Comintern submitted by the Programme Commission of the Executive Committee of the Comin-tern. 
 At least seven such specific features might be noted. 
 1) The draft provides a programme not for partic-ular national Communist Parties, but for all Communist Parties taken together, covering what is common andbasic to all of them. 
 Hence it is a programme based on principle and theory. 
 2) It was the custom formerly to provide a programme for the “civilised” nations. 
 The draft programme dif-fers from this in that it is intended for all the nations of the world—both white and black, both of the metro-politan countries and of the colonies. 
 Hence its all-em-bracing, profoundly international character. 
 3) The draft takes as its point of departure not some particular capitalism of some particular country or portion of the world, but the entire world system of capitalism, counterposing to it the world system of social-ist economy. 
 Hence its distinction from all hitherto exist-ing programmes. 
 4) The draft proceeds from the uneven development of the capitalist countries and draws the conclusion that the victory of socialism is possible in separate countries, thus envisaging the prospect of the formation of two par-allel centres of attraction—the centre of world capital-ism and the centre of world socialism. 
 5) Instead of the slogan of a United States of Europe, the draft puts forward the slogan of a federation of So-viet Republics which consists of advanced countries and colonies that have dropped, or are dropping, out ofthe imperialist system, and which is opposed in its struggle for world socialism to the world capitalist system. 
 6) The draft stresses opposition to Social-Democracy- as the main support of capitalism in the working class- and as the chief enemy of communism, and holds that-all other trends in the working class (anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism, guild socialism, 55 etc. 
) are in essence va-rieties of Social-Democratism. 
 7) The draft puts in the forefront the task of consol-idating the Communist Parties both in the West and in the East as a preliminary condition for ensuring thehegemony of the proletariat, and then also the dictator-ship of the proletariat. 
 The plenum of the Central Committee approved in principle the draft programme of the Comintern, and charged comrades having amendments to the draft to submit them to the Programme Commission of the SixthCongress. 
 So much for questions concerning the Comintern. 
 Now let us turn to questions concerning our inter-nal development. 
 II QUESTIONS OF SOCIALIST CONSTRUCTION IN THE U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 1. 
 GRAIN PROCUREMENT POLICY Permit me to give a little historical information. 
 What was the position by January 1 of this year? You know from the Party documents that by January 1 of this year we had a deficit of 128,000,000 poods of grain as compared with the corresponding period last year. 
 Ishall not dilate on the reasons for this: they are set forth in the Party documents published in the press. 
 The important thing for us now is that we bad a deficit of 128,000,000 poods. 
 Yet only two or three months remained until the spring thaw on the roads. 
 We were thus facedwith the alternative: either to make up for lost time and establish a normal rate of grain procurement in future, or to face the inevitability of a serious crisis of our en-tire national economy. 
 What had to be done to make up for lost time? It was necessary, in the first place, to strike at the kulaksand speculators who were forcing up grain prices and- threatening the country with hunger. 
 It was necessary, in the second place, to consign the maximum quantityof manufactured goods to the grain-growing regions. 
 It was necessary, lastly, to rouse all our Party organisa-tions into activity and bring about a radical change inall our grain procurement work by putting an end to the practice of allowing things to go of their own accord. 
 Thus we were compelled to resort to emergency measures. 
The measures we took proved effective, and by the end of March we had been able to secure 275,000,000 poods of grain. 
 We not only made up for lost time, we not onlyaverted a crisis of our whole economy, we not only caught up with last year’s rate of grain procurement; we also had every possibility of emerging from the procurementcrisis painlessly, if we maintained any normal rate of procurement in the subsequent months (April, May and June). 
 Owing, however, to the failure of the winter crops in the South Ukraine, and partly in the North Caucasus, the Ukraine completely, and the North Caucasus par-tially, dropped out as supplying regions, depriving the Republic of 20,000,000-30,000,000 poods of grain. 
 This circumstance, combined with the fact that we had permit-ted an over-expenditure of grain, faced us with the un-avoidable necessity of pressing harder on the other regionsand thus of encroaching on the peasants’ emergency stocks, and this could not but worsen the situation. 
 Whereas we had succeeded in January-March in se-curing nearly 300,000,000 poods affecting only the peas-ants’ manoeuvring stocks, in April-June we failed to secure even a hundred million poods, owing to the factthat we had to encroach on the peasants’ emergency stocks, and at a time, moreover, when the harvest prospects were not yet clear. 
 Nevertheless, grain had to be secured. 
Hence the renewed recourse to emergency measures, the arbitrary administrative measures, the infringements of revolutionary law, the house-to-house visitations, theunlawful searches and so on, which worsened the politi-cal situation in the country and created a threat to the bond. 
 Was this a rupture of the bond? No, it was not. 
 Was it, perhaps, some trifling matter not worthy of consid-eration? No, it was not a trifling matter. 
 It was a threatto the bond between the working class and the peas-antry. 
 That, in fact, explains why some of our Party workers lacked the calmness and firmness necessary forappraising the situation soberly and without exagger-ation. 
 The subsequent good harvest prospects and the par-tial withdrawal of the emergency measures helped to calm the atmosphere and improve the situation. 
 What is the nature of our difficulties on the grain front? What is the basis of these difficulties? Is it not a fact that we now have a grain crop area nearby as large as before the war (only five per cent smaller)? Is it not a fact that we are now producing nearly as much grain as before the war (about 5,000 million poods, oronly 200,000,000-300,000,000 poods less)? How is it that, in spite of this, we are producing only half as much marketable grain as in the pre-war period? It is because of the highly scattered character of our agriculture. 
 Whereas before the war we had about 16,000,000 peasant farms, now we have not less than24,000,000; moreover, the splitting up of the peasant households and peasant holdings is showing no tendency to cease. 
 And what is small-peasant farming? It is theform of husbandry that produces the smallest marketable surplus, is the least remunerative, and is in the high-est degree a natural, consuming form of husbandry,yielding a surplus of only 12-15 per cent of marketable grain. 
 Yet our towns and industry are growing rapidly, con-struction is developing and the demand for marketablegrain is growing at incredible speed. 
 That is the basis of our difficulties on the grain front. 
 Here is what Lenin said on this score in his speech on “The Tax in Kind”: “If peasant farming can develop further, we must firmly assure its transition to the next stage too, and this transition to the next stage will inevitably consist in the small, isolated peasant farms, the least profitable and most backward, gradual-ly uniting to form socially-conducted, large farms. 
 That is how Socialists have always conceived it. 
 That is how our Communist Party conceives it” (V ol. 
 XXVI, p. 
 299). 
 There, then, is the basis of our difficulties on the grain front. 
 What is the way out? The way out is, firstly, to improve small-and middle-peasant farming, giving it every encouragement to expand its yield, its productivity. 
 Our task is to replacethe wooden plough by the steel plough, to supply pure seed, fertiliser and small types of machines, to embrace the individual peasant farms in a broad co-operative net-work by concluding agreements (contracts) with whole villages. 
 There exists the method of concluding contracts between agricultural co-operatives and entire villages,the purpose of which is to supply the peasants with seed and thus obtain higher crop yields, to ensure the prompt delivery of grain by the peasants to the state, giving themin return a bonus in the shape of a certain addition to the contractual price, and to create stable relations be-tween the state and the peasantry. 
 Experience shows thatthis method is productive of tangible results. 
 There are people who think that individual peasant farming has exhausted its potentialities and that thereis no point in supporting it. 
 That is not true, comrades. 
 These people have nothing in common with the line of our Party. 
 There are people, on the other hand, who think that individual peasant farming is the be-all and end-all of agriculture. 
 That also is not true. 
 More, thesepeople are obviously sinning against the principles of Leninism. 
 We need neither detractors nor eulogisers of individ-ual peasant farming. 
 We need sober-minded politicians capable of obtaining from individual peasant farming the maximum that can be obtained from it, and at thesame time capable of gradually transferring individual farming to collectivist lines. 
 The way out, secondly, is gradually to unite the iso-lated small-and middle-peasant farms into large collec-tive and co-operative farms, which should be abso-lutely voluntary associations operating on a new techni-cal basis, on the basis of tractors and other agricultural machines. 
 In what does the advantage of collective farms over small farms consist? In the fact that they are large farms and are therefore able to utilise all the resultsof science and technology; they are more remunerative and stable; they are more productive and yield larger marketable surpluses. 
 It should not be forgotten thatthe collective farms yield a surplus of from 30 to 35 per cent of marketable grain, and that their yield is sometimes as high as 200 poods per dessiatin or more. 
 The way out, lastly, is to improve the old state farms and establish new large state farms. 
 It should be remem-bered that the state farms are the economic units whichproduce the largest marketable surpluses. 
 We have state farms which yield a surplus of not less than 60 per cent of marketable grain. 
 The task is correctly to combine all these three tasks and to work strenuously along all these three lines. 
 The specific feature of the present moment is that fulfilment of the first task, that of improving individ-ual small-and middle-peasant farming, while it is still our chief task in the sphere of agriculture, is alreadyinsufficient for the solution of the problem as a whole. 
 The specific feature of the present moment is that the first task must be supplemented by two new practi-cal tasks: promotion of collective farming and improve-ment of state farming. 
 But besides the basic causes, there were also specific, temporary causes which converted our procure-ment difficulties into a procurement crisis. 
 What arethese causes? The resolution of the plenum of the Central Committee includes among them the following: a) a disturbance of market equilibrium, aggravated by a more rapid increase of the peasants’ effective demand than of the supply of manufactured goods, owing to the rise of rural incomes resulting from a series of good har-vests, and especially to the rise of incomes of the well-to-do and kulak strata; b) an unfavourable relation between grain prices and the prices of other agricultural produce, which lessened the incentive to sell grain surpluses, and which the Par-ty, however, could not change in the spring of this yearwithout damaging the interests of the economically weaker strata of the rural population; c) mistakes in planned management, chiefly as re-gards the timely consignment of manufactured goods to the countryside and the incidence of taxation (the low tax on the wealthier strata of the rural population),and also as regards proper expenditure of grain stocks; d) defects of the Party and Soviet procurement organ-isations (no united front, lack of energetic action, re-liance on things going of their own accord); e) infringement of revolutionary law, arbitrary ad-ministrative measures, house-to-house visitations, par-tial closing of local markets, etc. 
; f) exploitation of all these unfavourable factors by the capitalist elements of town and country (kulaks,speculators) in order to undermine grain procure-ment and worsen the political situation in the country, While it will require several years to put an end to the general causes, it is quite possible to do away at once with the specific, temporary causes and thus avert thepossibility of a repetition of the grain procurement crisis. 
 What is required in order to put an end to these spe-cific causes? It requires: a) putting an immediate stop to the practice of house-to-house visitations, unlawful searches and all otherinfringements of revolutionary law; b) putting an immediate stop to any kind of reversion to the surplus-appropriation system and to all attemptswhatsoever to close peasant markets, with the adoption by the state of flexible forms of regulating trade; c) a certain increase of grain prices, differentiated according to region and kind of grain; d) proper organisation of the consignment of manu-factured goods to the grain procurement areas; e) proper organisation of the supply of grain, not permitting over-expenditure; f) formation, without fail, of a state grain reserve. 
An honest and systematic carrying out of these meas-ures, taking into account this year’s favourable har-vest, should create a situation that will rule out thenecessity of resorting to emergency measures of any kind in the coming grain procurement campaign. 
 It is the immediate task of the Party to see to it that these measures are carried out faithfully. 
 The grain difficulties have faced us with the question of the bond, of the future of the alliance between theworkers and peasants, of the means of strengthening this alliance. 
 Some say that the bond no longer exists, that the bond has been replaced by estrangement. 
 That, of course, is foolish and worthy only of panicmongers. 
 When there is no bond, the peasant loses faith in themorrow, he retires into himself, he ceases to believe in the stability of the Soviet Government, which is the chief purchaser of peasant grain, he begins to reduce hiscrop area, or at any rate does not risk enlarging it, fear-ing that there will again be house-to-house visitations, searches and so on and that his grain will be taken awayfrom him. 
 But what do we find in reality? We find that the spring crop area has been enlarged in all areas. 
 It is a factthat in the principal grain-growing areas the peasant has enlarged his spring crop area by from 2 per cent to 15 and 20 per cent. 
 Is it not clear that the peasantdoes not believe that the emergency measures will be permanent, and has every ground for believing that grain prices will be raised. 
 Does that look like estrange-ment? This, of course, does not mean that there is no threat, or that there has been no threat, to the bond. 
 But to conclude from this that there is estrangement is tolose one’s head and become a slave to elemental forces. 
 Some comrades think that, in order to strengthen the bond, the main stress must be shifted from heavyindustry to light industry (textiles), believing that tex-tiles are the principal and exclusive “bond” industry. 
 That is not true, comrades. 
 It is quite untrue! Of course, the textile industry is of enormous im-portance for the establishment of goods exchange between socialist industry and peasant farming. 
 But to think forthis reason that textiles are the exclusive basis of the bond is to commit a very gross error. 
 Actually, the bond between industry and peasant farming is maintained not only through cotton goods, which the peasant requires for his personal consumption, but also through metalsand through seed, fertiliser and agricultural machines of all kinds, which the peasant requires as a producer of grain. 
 That is apart from the fact that the textile indus-try itself cannot develop or exist unless heavy industry, machine-building, develops. 
 The need for the bond is not in order to preserve and perpetuate classes. 
 The bond is needed in order to bring the peasantry closer to the working class, to re-educate the peasant, to remould his individualist mentality, toremake him in the spirit of collectivism, and thus pave the way for the elimination, the abolition of classes on the basis of a socialist society. 
 Whoever does not realisethis, or refuses to recognise it, is not a Marxist, not a Leninist, but a “peasant philosopher,” who looks back-ward instead of forward. 
 And how is the peasant to be remade, remoulded? First and foremost, he can be remoulded only through new technical equipment and through collective labour. 
 Here is what Lenin says on this score: “The remaking of the small tiller, the remoulding of his whole mentality and habits, is a work of generations. 
 As regards the small tiller, this problem can be solved, his whole mentality can be put on healthy lines, so to speak, only by the material base, by technical means, by introducing tractors and machines in agriculture on a mass scale, by electrification on a mass scale. 
 That is what would remake the small tiller fundamentally and with immense rapidity” (V ol. 
 XXVI, p. 
 239). 
 Quite clearly, he who thinks that the bond can be guaranteed only through textiles, and forgets about met-als and machines, which transform peasant farming through collective labour, helps to perpetuate classes; he is not a proletarian revolutionary, he is a “peasantphilosopher. 
” Here is what Lenin says in another passage: “Only if we succeed in practice in showing the peasants the advantages of common, collective, co-operative, artel cultiva-tion of the soil, only if we succeed in helping the peasant by means of co-operative, artel farming, will the working class, which holds state power in its hands, actually prove to the peasant the correctness of its policy and actually secure the real and du-rable following of the vast masses of the peasantry” (V ol. 
 XXIV , p. 
 579). 
 That is how to ensure that the vast masses of the peas-antry are really and durably won over to the side of the working class, to the side of socialism. 
 It is sometimes said that to guarantee the bond we have only one reserve—concessions to the peasantry. 
 On this assumption the theory of continuous concessions is sometimes advanced, in the belief that the working classcan strengthen its position by making continuous con-cessions. 
 That is not true, comrades. 
 It is quite untrue! Such a theory can only ruin matters. 
 It is a theory ofdespair. 
 In order to strengthen the bond, we must have at our disposal, besides the reserve of concessions, a numberof other reserves, in the shape of economic strong points in the countryside (developed co-operatives, col-lective farms, state farms), and also in the shape ofpolitical strong points (energetic work among the poor peasants and assured support on the part of the poor peasants). 
 The middle peasantry is a vacillating class. 
 If we do I not have the support of the poor peasant, if the Soviet Government is weak in the countryside, the middle peas-ant may swing towards the kulak. 
 And, on the contrary, if we have the sure support of the poor peasant, it may be said with certainty that the middle peasant will swingtowards the Soviet Government. 
 Hence, systematic work among the poor peasants and ensuring them both seed and low-cost grain is an immediate task of the Party. 
 2. 
 TRAINING OF CADRES FOR THE WORK OF INDUSTRIAL CONSTRUCTION Let us pass now to the question of providing our industry with new cadres of a technical intelligentsia. 
 This question concerns our difficulties in industry, difficulties which came to light in connection with theShakhty affair. 
 What is the essence of the Shakhty affair from the point of view of the improvement of industry? The es-sence and significance of the Shakhty affair lies in the fact that we proved to be practically unarmed and ab-solutely backward, scandalously backward, in the mat-ter of providing our industry with a certain minimum of experts devoted to the cause of the working class. 
 The lesson of the Shakhty affair is that we must expe-dite the formation, the training, of a new technical in telligentsia consisting of members of the working class devoted to the cause of socialism and capable of techni-cally directing our socialist industry. 
 That does not mean that we shall discard those ex-perts who are not Soviet-minded or not Communists, but who are willing to co-operate with the Soviet Govern-ment. 
 It does not mean that. 
 We shall continue to strive with might and main to enlist the co-operation ofnon-Party experts, non-Party technicians, who are pre-pared to work hand in hand with the Soviet Government in building our industry. 
 We by no means demand thatthey should renounce their social and political opinions at once, or change them immediately. 
 We demand only one thing, and that is that they should co-operate withthe Soviet Government honestly, once they have vol-untarily agreed to do so. 
 But the point is that such old experts who are pre-pared to work hand in hand with the Soviet Government are becoming relatively fewer and fewer. 
 The point is that it is absolutely necessary to have a new force ofyoung experts to succeed them. 
 Well, the Party considers that the new replacements must be brought into being at an accelerated rate if we do not want to be faced withnew surprises, and that they must come from the work-ing class, from among the working people. 
 That means creating a new technical intelligentsia capable of satis-fying the needs of our industry. 
 The facts show that the People’s Commissariat of Education has failed to cope with this important task. 
We have no reason to believe that, if left to itself, the People’s Commissariat of Education, which has very lit-tle connection with industry, and which is inert andconservative into the bargain, will be able to cope with this task in the near future. 
 The Party, therefore, has come to the conclusion that the work of speedily form-ing a new technical intelligentsia must be divided among three People’s Commissariats—the People’s Com-missariat of Education, the Supreme Council of National Economy and the People’s Commissariat of Trans-port. 
 The Party considers that this is the most expedi-ent way of ensuring the required speed in this important work. 
 That is why a number of technical colleges have been transferred to the Supreme Council of National Econ-omy and the People’s Commissariat of Transport. 
 This, of course, does not mean that transfer of techni-cal colleges is all that is required for speedily form-ing new cadres of a technical intelligentsia. 
 Undoubted-ly, material provision for the students will be a highly important factor. 
 The Soviet Government has thereforedecided to rate the expenditure on the training of new cadres on the same level of importance as expenditure on the capital development of industry, and has deci-ded to allocate annually an additional sum of over 40,000,000 rubles for this purpose. 
 III CONCLUSION It must be admitted, comrades, that we have always learned from our difficulties and blunders. 
 At any rate, it has been the case so far that history has taught us andtempered our Party in the school of difficulties, of crises of one kind or another, of mistakes of one kind or another that we have committed. 
 So it was in 1918, when, as a result of our difficul-ties on the Eastern Front, of our reverses in the fight against Kolchak, we realised at last the necessity ofcreating a regular infantry, and really did create it. 
 So it was in 1919, when, as a result of the difficul-ties on the Denikin Front, of Mamontov’s raid into the rear of our armies, we realised at last the necessityof having a strong regular cavalry, and really did cre-ate it. 
 I think that this is more or less the case today. 
 The grain difficulties will not have been without their value for us. 
 They will stir Bolsheviks into action and impel them to tackle in earnest the work of developing agri-culture, especially of developing grain farming. 
 Had it not been for these difficulties, it is doubtful whether the Bolsheviks would have tackled the grain problem se-riously. 
 The same must be said of the Shakhty affair and the difficulties resulting from it. 
 The lessons of the Shakhtyaffair will not and cannot be without their value for our Party. 
 I think that these lessons will impel us to face squarely the problem of creating a new technical intel-ligentsia capable of serving our socialist industry. 
 By the way, you see that we have already taken the first serious step towards the solution of the problemof creating a new technical intelligentsia. 
 Let us hope that this step will not be the last.

 162, June 26, 1928 TO THE LENINGRAD OSOA VIAKHIM56 The strengthening of the defence of the Soviet Union is the cause of all the working people. 
 The proletarians of Leningrad were in the foremost ranks in the battles of the civil war. 
 The proletarians of Leningrad must now, too, set an example of organisation, discipline and solidarity in preparing for defence of the Soviet Union against the enemies of the working class. 
 I have no doubt that the Leningrad Osoaviakhim, which is a mass organisation of the Leningrad proletar-ians, will fulfil its duty to the land of the proletariandictatorship.

 163, July 15, 1928 LETTER TO COMRADE KUIBYSHEV Greetings, Comrade Kuibyshev! Cooper arrived today. 
 The talk will take place to-morrow. 
 We shall see what he has to say about the Amer-ican plans. 
 I have read Cooper’s sixth report letter on the Dnie-per Hydro-Electric Power Station. 
 Of course, the other side must be heard too. 
 However, it seems to me (suchis my first impression) that Cooper is right and Winter is wrong. 
 The generally recognised fact that the Cooper type of coffer-dam (which Winter opposed) has provedto be the only suitable one—this fact alone shows that what Cooper has to say must certainly be listened to atten-tively. 
 It would be well if Cooper’s sixth letter wereexamined in the proper quarters and accepted in prin-ciple. 
 How are things with you? I have heard that Tomsky has it in for you. 
 He is a malicious fellow and not always clean in his methods. 
 It seems to me he is wrong. 
 I have read your report on rationalisation. 
 It is the rightsort of report. 
 What more does Tomsky want of you? How are things going at the Tsaritsyn tractor works and the Leningrad tractor workshops? Can we hopethey will be a success? Cordially, Stalin August 31, 1928 Published for the first time TO THE MEMORY OF COMRADE I.

 SKVORTSOV-STEPANOV Death has snatched from our ranks a staunch and steadfast Leninist, a member of the Central Committee of our Party, Comrade Skvortsov-Stepanov. 
 For decades Comrade Skvortsov-Stepanov fought in our ranks, enduring all the hardships of the life of a professional revolutionary. 
 Many thousands of comrades know him as one of the oldest and most popular of ourMarxist writers. 
 They know him also as a most active participant in the October Revolution. 
 They know him, lastly, as a most devoted champion of the Leninist uni-ty and iron solidarity of our Party. 
 Comrade Skvortsov-Stepanov devoted his whole life of brilliant labour to the cause of the victory of the dic-tatorship of the proletariat. 
 May the memory of Comrade Skvortsov-Stepanov live in the hearts of the working class! J.

P . 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) October 19, 1928 I think, comrades, that we must first rid our minds of trivialities, of personal matters, and so forth, in orderto settle the question which interests us, that of the Right deviation. 
 Is there a Right, opportunist danger in our Party? Do there exist objective conditions favourable to the de-velopment of such a danger? How should this danger be fought? These are the questions that now confront us. 
 But we shall not settle this question of the Right deviation unless we purge it of all the trivialities and adventitious elements which have surrounded it andwhich prevent us from understanding its essence. 
 Zapolsky is wrong in thinking that the question of the Right deviation is an accidental one. 
 He asserts thatit is all not a matter of a Right deviation, but of petty squabbles, personal intrigues, etc. 
 Let us assume for a moment that petty squabbles and personal intrigues doplay some part here, as in all struggles. 
 But to explain everything by petty squabbles and to fail to see the es-sence of the question behind the squabbles, is to departfrom the correct, Marxist path. 
 A large, united organisation of long standing, such as the Moscow organisation undoubtedly is, could not be /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR stirred up from top to bottom and set into motion by the efforts of a few squabblers or intriguers. 
 No, comrades, such miracles do not happen. 
 That is apart from the factthat the strength and power of the Moscow organisation cannot be estimated so lightly. 
 Obviously, more pro-found causes have been at work here causes which havenothing to do with either petty squabbles or intrigues. 
 Fruntov is also wrong; for although he admits the existence of a Right danger, he does not think it worthwhile for serious, busy people to concern themselves with it seriously. 
 In his opinion, the question of the Right deviation is a subject for noise-makers, not for seriouspeople. 
 I quite understand Fruntov: he is so absorbed in the day-to-day practical work that he has no time to think about the prospects of our development. 
 But thatdoes not mean that we must convert the narrow, practi-cal empiricism of certain of our Party workers into a dog-ma of our work of construction. 
 A healthy practicalismis a good thing; but if it loses sight of the prospects in the work and fails to subordinate the work to the basic line of the Party, it becomes a drawback. 
 And yet itshould not be difficult to understand that the question of the Right deviation is a question of the basic line of our Party; it is the question as to whether the prospectsof development outlined by our Party at the Fifteenth Congress are correct or incorrect. 
 Those comrades who in discussing the problem of the Right deviation concentrate on the question of the individuals representing the Right deviation are also wrong. 
 Show us who are the Rights and the conciliators,they say, name them, so that we can deal with them ac-cordingly. 
 That is not the correct way of presenting the question. 
 Individuals, of course, play some part. 
 Nev-ertheless, the question is not one of individuals, but of the conditions, of the situation, giving rise to the Rightdanger in the Party. 
 Individuals can be kept out, but that does not mean that we have thereby cut the roots of the Right danger in our Party. 
 Hence, the questionof individuals does not settle the matter, although it is undoubtedly of interest. 
 In this connection I cannot help recalling an inci-dent which occurred in Odessa at the end of 1919 and the beginning of 1920, when our forces, having driven Denikin’s forces out of the Ukraine, were crushing thelast remnants of his armies in the area of Odessa. 
 One group of Red Army men searched high and low for the “En-tente” in Odessa, convinced that if they could only captureit—the Entente—the war would be over. 
 ( General laugh-ter. 
) It is conceivable that our Red Army men might have captured some representatives of the Entente inOdessa, but that, of course, would not have settled the question of the Entente, for the roots of the Entente did not lie in Odessa, although Odessa at that time wasthe Denikinites’ last terrain, but in world capitalism. 
 The same can be said of certain of our comrades, who in the question of the Right deviation concentrateon the individuals representing that deviation, and for-get about the conditions that give rise to it. 
 That is why we must first of all elucidate here the conditions that give rise to the Right, and also to the “Left” (Trotskyite), deviation from the Leninist line. 
 Under capitalist conditions the Right deviation in communism signifies a tendency, an inclination that has not yet taken shape, it is true, and is perhaps not yet consciously realised, but nevertheless a tendency of a section of the Communists to depart from the revo-lutionary line of Marxism in the direction of Social-Democracy. 
 When certain groups of Communists deny the expediency of the slogan “Class against class” in election campaigns (France), or are opposed to the Com-munist Party nominating its own candidates (Britain), or are disinclined to make a sharp issue of the fight against “Left” Social-Democracy (Germany), etc. 
, etc. 
,it means that there are people in the Communist Parties who are striving to adapt communism to Social-Democ-ratism. 
 A victory of the Right deviation in the Communist Parties of the capitalist countries would mean the ideological rout of the Communist Parties and anenormous strengthening of Social-Democratism. 
 And what does an enormous strengthening of Social-Democ-ratism mean? It means the strengthening and consoli-dation of capitalism, for Social-Democracy is the main support of capitalism in the working class. 
 Consequently, a victory of the Right deviation in the Communist Parties of the capitalist countries would lead to a development of the conditions necessary for the preservation of capitalism. 
 Under the conditions of Soviet development , when cap-italism has already been overthrown, but its roots have not yet been torn out, the Right deviation in com-munism signifies a tendency, an inclination that has not yet taken shape, it is true, and is perhaps not yet consciously realised, but nevertheless a tendencyof a section of the Communists to depart from the general line of our Party in the direction of bourgeois ideology. 
 When certain circles of our Communists strive to drag the Party back from the decisions of the Fifteenth Congress, by denying the need for an offen-sive against the capitalist elements in the countryside; or demand a contraction of our industry, in the belief that its present rapid rate of development is fatal forthe country; or deny the expediency of subsidies to the collective farms and state farms, in the belief that such subsidies are money thrown to the winds; or deny theexpediency of fighting against bureaucracy by methods of self-criticism, in the belief that self-criticism under-mines our apparatus; or demand that the monopoly offoreign trade be relaxed, etc. 
, etc. 
, it means that there are people in the ranks of our Party who are striving, perhaps without themselves realising it, to adapt oursocialist construction to the tastes and requirements of the “Soviet” bourgeoisie. 
 A victory of the Right deviation in our Party would mean an enormous strengthening of the capitalist ele-ments in our country. 
 And what does the strengthening of the capitalist elements in our country mean? It meansweakening the proletarian dictatorship and increasing the chances of the restoration of capitalism. 
 Consequently, a victory of the Right deviation in our Party would mean a development of the conditions necessary for the restoration of capitalism in our country. 
 Have we in our Soviet country any of the conditions that would make the restoration of capitalism possible ? Yes, we have. 
 That, comrades, may appear strange, but it is a fact. 
 We have overthrown capitalism, we have es-tablished the dictatorship of the proletariat, we are de-veloping our socialist industry at a rapid pace and are linking peasant economy with it. 
 But we have not yet torn out the roots of capitalism. 
 Where are these roots im-bedded? They are imbedded in commodity production,in small production in the towns and, especially, the countryside. 
 As Lenin says, the strength of capitalism lies “in the strength of small production . 
 For, unfortunately, small production is still very, very widespread in the world, and small production engenders capitalism and the bourgeoisie continuously, daily, hourly, spon-taneously, and on a mass scale” (see V ol. 
 XXV , p. 
 173). 
 It is clear that, since small production bears a mass, and even a predominant character in our country, and since it engenders capitalism and the bourgeoisie continuously and on a mass scale, particularly under theconditions of NEP, we have in our country conditions which make the restoration of capitalism possible . 
 Have we in our Soviet country the necessary means and forces to abolish, to eliminate the possibility of the restoration of capitalism? Yes, we have. 
 And it is this fact that proves the correctness of Lenin’s thesis on thepossibility of building a complete socialist society in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 For this purpose it is necessary to consol-idate the dictatorship of the proletariat strengthenthe alliance between the working class and peasantry, develop our key positions from the standpoint of industri-alising the country, develop industry at a rapid rate,electrify the country, place the whole of our nation-al economy on a new technical basis, organise the peasantry into co-operatives on a mass scale and in-crease the yield of its farms gradually unite the individual peasant farms into socially conducted, collective farms, develop state farms, restrict and overcome the cap-italist elements in town and country, etc. 
, etc. 
 Here is what Lenin says on this subject: “As long as we live in a small-peasant country, there is a surer economic basis for capitalism in Russia than for communism. 
This must be borne in mind. 
 Anyone who has carefully observedlife in the countryside, as compared with life in the towns, knowsthat we have not torn out the roots of capitalism and have not un-dermined the foundation, the basis of the internal enemy. 
 The latter depends on small-scale production, and there is only one way of undermining it, namely, to place the economy of thecountry, including agriculture, on a new technical basis, the techni-cal basis of modern large-scale production. 
 And it is only elec-tricity that is such a basis. 
 Communism is Soviet power plus theelectrification of the whole country. 
 Otherwise, the country will remain a small-peasant country, and we have got to understand that clearly. 
 We are weaker than capitalism, not only on a worldscale, but also within the country. 
 Everybody knows this. 
 We areconscious of it, and we shall see to it that our economic base istransformed from a small-peasant base into a large-scale indus-trial base. 
 Only when the country has been electrified, only when our industry, our agriculture, our transport system have been placed upon the technical basis of modern large-scale industryshall we achieve final victory” (V ol. 
 XXVI, pp. 
 46-47). 
 It follows, firstly, that as long as we live in a small-peasant country, as long as we have not torn out the roots of capitalism, there is a surer economic basis for capi-talism than for communism. 
 It may happen that you cut down a tree but fail to tear out the roots; your strength does not suffice for this. 
 Hence the possibility of the res-toration of capitalism in our country. 
 Secondly, it follows that besides the possibility of the restoration of capitalism there is also the possibil-ity of the victory of socialism in our country, because we can destroy the possibility of the restoration of cap-italism, we can tear out the roots of capitalism and achieve final victory over capitalism in our country,if we intensify the work of electrifying the country, if we place our industry, agriculture and transport on the technical basis of modern, large-scale industry. 
Hence the possibility of the victory of socialism in our country. 
 Lastly, it follows that we cannot build socialism in industry alone and leave agriculture to the mercy of spontaneous development on the assumption that the countryside will “move by itself” following the lead of thetowns. 
 The existence of socialist industry in the towns is the principal factor in the socialist transforma-tion of the countryside. 
 But it does not mean that thatfactor is quite sufficient. 
 If the socialist towns are to take the lead of the peasant countryside all the way, it is essential, as Lenin says, “to place the economyof the country, including agriculture ,* on a new technical basis, the technical basis of modern large-scale produc-tion. 
” Does this quotation from Lenin contradict another of his statements, to the effect that “NEP fully ensures us the possibility * of laying the foundation of a so-cialist economy”? No, it does not. 
 On the contrary, the two statements fully coincide. 
 Lenin by no means says that NEP gives us socialism ready-made. 
 Lenin merelysays that NEP ensures us the possibility of laying the foundation of a socialist economy. 
 There is a great difference between the possibility of building socialism * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 and the actual building of socialism . 
 Possibility and actuality must not be confused. 
 It is precisely for the purpose of transforming possibility into actuality thatLenin proposes the electrification of the country and the placing of industry, agriculture and transport on the technical basis of modern large-scale production as acondition for the final victory of socialism in our country. 
 But this condition for the building of socialism can-not be fulfilled in one or two years. 
 It is impossible inone or two years to industrialise the country, build up a powerful industry, organise the vast masses of the peas-antry into co-operatives, place agriculture on a new tech-nical basis, unite the individual peasant farms into large collective farms, develop state farms, and restrict and overcome the capitalist elements in town andcountry. 
 Years and years of intense constructive work by the proletarian dictatorship will be needed for this. 
 And until that is accomplished—and it can not be accom-plished all at once—we shall remain a small peasant country, where small production engenders capitalism and the bourgeoisie continuously and on a mass scale,and where the danger of the restoration of capitalism remains. 
 And since our proletariat does not live in a vacuum, but in the midst of the most actual and real life with all its variety of forms, the bourgeois elements aris-ing on the basis of small production “encircle the prole-tariat on every side with petty bourgeois elemental forces, by means of which they permeate and corrupt the proletariat and continually cause relapses among theproletariat into petty-bourgeois spinelessness, disunity, individualism, and alternate moods of exaltation and dejection” (Lenin, V ol. 
 XXV , p. 
 189), thereby intro-ducing into the ranks of the proletariat and of its Party a certain amount of vacillation, a certain amount ofwavering. 
 There you have the root and the basis of all sorts of vacillations and deviations from the Leninist line inthe ranks of our Party. 
 That is why the Right and “Left” deviations in our Party cannot be regarded as a trifling matter. 
 Where does the danger of the Right , frankly oppor-tunist, deviation in our Party lie? In the fact that it underestimates the strength of our enemies, the strength of capitalism: it does not see the danger of the resto-ration of capitalism; it does not understand the mecha-nism of the class struggle under the dictatorship of theproletariat and therefore so readily agrees to make con-cessions to capitalism, demanding a slowing down of the rate of development of our industry, demanding con-cessions for the capitalist elements in town and coun-try, demanding that the question of collective farms and state farms be relegated to the background, demand-ing that the monopoly of foreign trade be relaxed, etc. 
, etc. 
 There is no doubt that the triumph of the Right deviation in our Party would unleash the forces of capi-talism, undermine the revolutionary positions of the pro-letariat and increase the chances of the restoration ofcapitalism in our country. 
 Where does the danger of the “ Left” (Trotskyite) deviation in our Party lie? In the fact that it over-estimates the strength of our enemies, the strength of capitalism; it sees only the possibility of the restoration of capitalism, but cannot see the possibility of build-ing socialism by the efforts of our country; it gives way to despair and is obliged to console itself with chatterabout Thermidor tendencies in our Party. 
 From the words of Lenin that “as long as we live in a small peasant country, there is a surer economicbasis for capitalism in Russia than for communism,” the “Left” deviation draws the false conclusion that it is impossible to build socialism in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 atall; that we cannot get anywhere with the peasantry; that the idea of an alliance between the working class and the peasantry is an obsolete idea; that unless a victo-rious revolution in the West comes to our aid the dic-tatorship of the proletariat in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 must fall or degenerate; that unless we adopt the fantastic planof super-industrialisation, even at the cost of a split with the peasantry, the cause of socialism in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 must be regarded as doomed. 
 Hence the adventurism in the policy of the “Left” deviation. 
 Hence its “superhuman” leaps in the sphere of policy. 
 There is no doubt that the triumph of the “Left” deviation in our Party would lead to the working class being separated from its peasant base, to the vanguardof the working class being separated from the rest of the working-class masses, and, consequently, to the de-feat of the proletariat and to facilitating conditionsfor the restoration of capitalism. 
 You see, therefore, that both these dangers, the “Left” and the Right, both these deviations from the Leninistline, the Right and the “Left,” lead to the same result, although from different directions. 
 Which of these dangers is worse? In my opinion one is as bad as the other. 
 The difference between these deviations from the point of view of successfully combating them consists in the fact that the danger of the “Left” deviation is at the present moment more obvious to the Party thanthe danger of the Right deviation. 
 The fact that an intense struggle has been waged against the “Left” de-viation for several years now has, of course, not beenwithout its value for the Party. 
 It is clear that the Party has learned a great deal in the years of the fight against the “Left,” Trotskyite deviation and cannot now beeasily deceived by “Left” phrases. 
 As for the Right danger, which existed before, but which has now become more prominent because of thegrowth of the petty-bourgeois elemental forces resulting from last year’s grain-procurement crisis, I think it is not quite so obvious to certain sections of our Party. 
 Thatis why our task must be—while not in the least relaxing the fight against the “Left,” Trotskyite danger—to lay the emphasis on the fight against the Right deviation andto take all measures to make the danger of this deviation as obvious to the Party as the Trotskyite danger. 
 The question of the Right deviation would not, per-haps, be as acute as it is now, were it not for the fact that it is connected with the difficulties accompany-ing our development. 
 But the whole point is that theexistence of the Right deviation complicates the diffi-culties accompanying our development and hinders our efforts to overcome these difficulties. 
 And for the veryreason that the Right danger hinders the efforts to over-come the difficulties, the question of overcoming the Right danger has assumed particularly great importance for us. 
 A few words about the nature of our difficulties. 
 It should be borne in mind that our difficulties should by no means be regarded as difficulties of stagnation or decline. 
 There are difficulties that arise at a timeof economic decline or stagnation, and in such cases efforts are made to render the stagnation less painful, or the decline less profound. 
 Our difficulties have noth-ing in common with difficulties of that kind. 
 The char-acteristic feature of our difficulties is that they are dif-ficulties of expansion , difficulties of growth. 
 When we speak about difficulties we usually mean by what per-centage industry ought to be expanded , by what percentage the crop area ought to be enlarged , by how many poods the crop yield ought to be increased , etc. 
, etc. 
 And because our difficulties are those of expansion, and not of decline or stagnation, they should not be anything particularlydangerous for the Party. 
 But difficulties are difficulties, nevertheless. 
 And since in order to overcome difficulties it is necessary toexert all efforts, to display firmness and endurance, and since not everybody possesses sufficient firmness and endurance—perhaps as a result of fatigue and overstrain,or because of a preference for a quiet life, free from struggle and commotion—it is just here that vacillations and waver-ings begin to take place, tendencies to adopt the line ofleast resistance, talk about slowing down the rate of in-dustrial development, about making concessions to the capitalist elements, about rejecting collective farms andstate farms and, in general, everything that goes beyond the calm and familiar conditions of the daily routine. 
 But unless we overcome the difficulties in our path we shall make no progress. 
 And in order to overcome the difficulties we must first defeat the Right danger,we must first overcome the Right deviation, which is hindering the fight against the difficulties and is trying to undermine our Party’s will to fight and overcomethe difficulties. 
 I a m speaking, of course, of a real fight against the Right deviation, not a verbal, paper fight. 
 Thereare people in our Party who, to soothe their conscience, are quite willing to proclaim a fight against the Right danger in the same way as priests sometimes cry, “Halle-lujah! Hallelujah!” But they will not undertake any prac-tical measures at all to organise the fight against the Right deviation on a firm basis, and to overcome thisdeviation in actual fact. 
 We call this tendency a con-ciliatory tendency towards the Right, frankly oppor-tunist, deviation. 
 It is not difficult to understand thatthe fight against this conciliatory tendency is an integral part of the general fight against the Right deviation, against the Right danger. 
 For it is impossible to overcomethe Right, opportunist deviation without waging a syste-matic fight against the conciliatory tendency, which takes the opportunists under its wing. 
 The question who are the exponents of the Right de-viation is undoubtedly of interest, although it is not of decisive importance. 
 We came across exponents of theRight danger in our lower Party organisations during the grain-procurement crisis last year, when a number of Communists in the volosts and villages opposed theParty’s policy and worked towards forming a bond with kulak elements. 
 As you know, such people were cleared out of the Party last spring, a matter specially referred to in the document of the Central Committee of our Party in February this year. 
 But it would be wrong to say that there are no such people left in our Party. 
 If we go higher up, to the uyezd and gubernia Party organisations, or if we dig deeperinto the Soviet and co-operative apparatus, we could without difficulty find exponents of the Right danger and conciliation towards it. 
 We know of“letters,” “declarations,” and other documents written by a number of functionaries in our Party and Soviet apparatus, in which the drift towards the Right devia-tion is quite distinctly expressed. 
 You know that these letters and documents were referred to in the verbatim report of the July plenum of the Central Committee. 
 If we go higher still, and ask about the members of the Central Committee, we shall have to admit that within the Central Committee, too, there are certainelements, very insignificant it is true, of a conciliatory attitude towards the Right danger. 
 The verbatim re-port of the July plenum of the Central Committee pro-vides direct proof of this. 
 Well, and what about the Political Bureau? Are there any deviations in the Political Bureau? In the Polit-ical Bureau there are neither Right nor “Left” devia-tions nor conciliators towards those deviations. 
 This must be said quite categorically. 
 It is time to put a stopto the tittle-tattle spread by enemies of the Party and by the oppositionists of all kinds about there being a Right deviation, or a conciliatory attitude towards theRight deviation, in the Political Bureau of our Central Committee. 
 Were there vacillations and waverings in the Moscow organisation, or in its top leadership, the Moscow Com-mittee? Yes, there were. 
 It would be absurd to assert nowthat there were no waverings, no vacillations there. 
 The candid speech made by Penkov is direct proof of this. 
 Penkov is by no means the least important person inthe Moscow organisation and in the Moscow Committee. 
 You heard him plainly and frankly admit that he had been wrong on a number of important questions of ourParty policy. 
 That does not mean, of course, that the Moscow Committee as a whole was subject to vacillation. 
 No, it does not mean that. 
 A document like the appealof the Moscow Committee to the members of the Moscow organisation in October of this year undoubtedly shows that the Moscow Committee has succeeded in overcomingthe vacillations of certain of its members. 
 I have no doubt that the leading core of the Moscow Committee will be able completely to straighten out the situation. 
 Certain comrades are dissatisfied with the fact that the district organisations interfered in this matter and demanded that an end be put to the mistakes and vacilla-tions of certain leaders of the Moscow organisation. 
 I do not see how this dissatisfaction can be justified. 
 What is there wrong about district activists of the Moscow organ-isation raising the demand that an end be put to mis-takes and vacillations? Does not our work proceed under the slogan of self-criticism from below? Is it not a factthat self-criticism increases the activity of the Party rank and file and of the proletarian rank and file in general? What is there wrong or dangerous in the factthat the district activists proved equal to the situation? Did the Central Committee act rightly in interfer-ing in this matter? I think that it did. 
 Berzin thinks that the Central Committee acted too drastically in demanding the removal of one of the district leaders to whom thedistrict organisation was opposed. 
 That is absolutely wrong. 
 Let me remind Berzin of certain incidents in 1919 or 1920, when some members of the Central Com-mittee who were guilty of certain, in my opinion, not very serious errors in respect of the Party line were, on Lenin’s suggestion, subjected to exemplary punish-ment, one of them being sent to Turkestan, and the other almost paying the penalty of expulsion from the Central Committee. 
 Was Lenin right in acting as he did? I think he was quite right. 
 The situation in the Central Committee then was not what it is now. 
 Half the members of theCentral Committee followed Trotsky, and the situation in the Central Committee was not a stable one. 
 The Cen-tral Committee today is acting much more mildly. 
 Why?Is it, perhaps, because we want to be more gentle than Lenin? No, that is not the point. 
 The point is that the position of the Central Committee is more stable nowthan it was then, and the Central Committee can afford to act more mildly. 
 Nor is Sakharov right in asserting that the interven-tion of the Central Committee was belated. 
 Sakharov is wrong because he evidently does not know that, properly speaking, the intervention of the Central Committee beganin February of this year. 
 Sakharov can convince him-self of that if he desires. 
 It is true that the intervention of the Central Committee did not immediately yieldrequired results. 
 But it would be strange to blame the Central Committee for that. 
 Conclusions : 1) the Right danger is a serious danger in our Party, for it is rooted in the social and economic situation inour country; 2) the danger of the Right deviation is aggravated by the existence of difficulties which cannot be overcomeunless the Right deviation and conciliation towards it are overcome; 3) in the Moscow organisation there were vacilla-tions and waverings, there were elements of instability; 4) the core of the Moscow Committee, with the help of the Central Committee and the district activists, tookall measures to put an end to these vacillations; 5) there can be no doubt that the Moscow Committee will succeed in overcoming the mistakes which began totake shape in the past; 6) our task is to put a stop to the internal struggle, to unite the Moscow organisation into a single whole, andto carry through the elections in the Party units suc-cessfully on the basis of fully developed self-criticism.

 247 October 23, 1928 REPLY TO COMRADE SH. 
 Comrade Sh. 
, I have received your letter and must say that I can-not possibly agree with you. 
 1) It is clear from the quotation from Lenin that so long as we remain a small-peasant country the danger of the restoration of capitalism will exist. 
 You saythat this opinion of Lenin’s “cannot be applied to the present period in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
” Why, one asks? Are we not still a small-peasant country? Of course , inasmuch as our socialist industry is develop-ing and collective forms of economy are beginning to take root in the countryside , the chances of the restoration of capitalism are diminishing . 
 That is a fact. 
 But does that mean that we have already ceased to be a small-peasant country? Does it mean that the socialist forms have developed tosuch an extent that the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 can no longer be con-sidered a small-peasant country? It obviously does not. 
 But what follows from this? Only one thing, name-ly, the danger of the restoration of capitalism in our country does exist. 
 How can one contest such an obvious fact? 2) You say in your letter: “It would appear from what you said about the Right and the ‘Left’ devia-tions that our difference both with the Rights and withthe ‘Lefts’ is only over the question of the rate of in-dustrialisation. 
 The question of the peasantry, on the other hand, was referred to in your assessment of the Trotskyist position only sketchily. 
 That gives rise to a very objectionable interpretation of your speech. 
” It is very possible that my speech* is interpreted differently by different people. 
 That is a matter of taste. 
 But that the thoughts expressed in your letter are notin accordance with reality is quite evident to me. 
 I said plainly in my speech that the Right deviation “under-estimates the strength of capitalism” in our country,“does not see the danger of the restoration of capitalism,” “does not understand the mechanism of the class strug-gle,” “and therefore so readily agrees to make conces-sions to capitalism. 
” I said plainly in my speech that “the triumph of the Right deviation in our Party” would “increase the chances of the restoration of capitalism inour country. 
” You will realise, of course, that what is referred to here is not merely the rate of industrialisation. 
 What more should be said about the Right deviation to satisfy you? As to the “Left,” Trotskyist, deviation, I said plain-ly in my speech that it denies the possibility of build-ing socialism in our country, rejects the idea of an alli-ance of the working class and the peasantry, and is pre-pared to carry out its fantastic plan of industrialisation atthe cost of a split with the peasantry. 
 I said in my speech (if you have read it) that “the triumph of the ‘Left’ devia-tion in our Party would lead to the working class beingseparated from its peasant base, to the vanguard of the working class being separated from the rest of the work-ing-class masses, and, consequently, to the defeat of the * See pp. 
 231-48 in this volume. 
— Ed. 
 proletariat and to facilitating conditions for the restora-tion of capitalism. 
” You will realise, of course, that what is referred to here is not merely the rate of industrialisation. 
 I think that everything fundamental we have ever said against Trotskyism is said here. 
 Of course, less was said in my speech about the “Left” deviation than about the Right. 
 But that is because the theme of my speech was the Right deviation, as I definitely specified at the beginning of my speech, andas was fully in accordance with the agenda of the joint plenum of the M. 
C. 
 and M. 
C. 
C. 
 But one thing cannot be denied, and that is that, despite this, everything fun-damental that at all distinguishes Trotskyism from Leninism on the one hand, and from the Right deviation on the other, was said in my speech. 
 What more should be said about Trotskyism in a speech devoted to the Right deviation to satisfy you? 3) You are not satisfied with my statement that in the Political Bureau there are neither Right nor “Left” deviations nor conciliation towards them. 
 Was I justified in making such a statement? I was. 
 Why? Becausewhen the text of the Central Committee ’s message to the members of the Moscow organisation was adopted by the Political Bureau , not one of the members of the Political Bureau present voted against it . 
 Is this a good or a bad thing? I think it is a good thing. 
 Can such a fact be disre-garded when characterising the Political Bureau in October 1928 ? Obviously not. 
 With communist greetings, J. 
 Stalin October 27, 1928 Published for the first time TO THE LENINIST YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE Greetings on the Day of the Tenth Anniversary of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League Greetings to the Leninist Young Communist League on its tenth anniversary! The Leninist Young Communist League was, and is, the young reserve of our revolution. 
 Tens and hundreds of thousands of the finest representatives of the younger generation of workers and peasants have been trainedin the ranks of the Young Communist League, received their revolutionary steeling and entered our Party, our Soviets, our trade unions, our Red Army, our Red Navy,our co-operatives, and our cultural organisations, to serve as the successors of the Bolshevik old guard. 
 The Young Communist League has succeeded in this difficult task because it has worked under the guid-ance of the Party; it has been able in its activities to combine study in general, and the study of Leninismin particular, with its day-to-day practical work; it has been able to educate the younger generation of work-ing men and women and peasant men and women inthe spirit of internationalism; it has been able to find a common language between the old and the young Leninists, between the old and the young guard; it hasbeen able to subordinate all its work to the interests of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the victory of socialist construction. 
 It is owing to this alone that the Young Communist League has succeeded in holding aloft the banner of Lenin. 
 Let us hope that in the future, too, the Young Com-munist League will succeed in performing its duty to-wards our proletariat and the international proletariat. 
 Greetings to the two-million reserve of our Party, the Leninist Young Communist League! Long live the young communist generation! J.

(B.

P . 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
)58 November 19, 1928 I shall deal, comrades, with three main questions raised in the theses of the Political Bureau. 
 Firstly, the industrialisation of the country and the fact that the key factor in industrialisation is thedevelopment of the production of the means of produc-tion, while ensuring the greatest possible speed of this development. 
 Next, the fact that the rate of development of our agriculture lags extremely behind the rate of develop-ment of our industry, and that because of this the mostburning question in our home policy today is that of agriculture, and especially the grain problem, the question how to improve, to reconstruct agriculture ona new technical basis. 
 And, thirdly and lastly, the deviations from the line of the Party, the struggle on two fronts, and the factthat our chief danger at the present moment is the Right danger, the Right deviation. 
 I THE RATE OF DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRY Our theses proceed from the premise that a fast rate of development of industry in general, and of theproduction of the means of production in particular, is the underlying principle of, and the key to, the in-dustrialisation of the country, the underlying principleof, and the key to, the transformation of our entire na-tional economy along the lines of socialist development. 
 But what does a fast rate of development of indus-try involve? It involves the maximum capital investment in industry. 
 And that leads to a state of tension in all our plans, budgetary and non-budgetary. 
 And, indeed,the characteristic feature of our control figures in the past three years, in the period of reconstruction, is that they have been compiled and carried out at a high ten-sion. 
 Take our control figures, examine our budget es-timates, talk with our Party comrades—both those who work in the Party organisations and those who directour Soviet, economic and co-operative affairs—and you will invariably find this one characteristic feature- everywhere, namely, the state of tension in our plans. 
 The question arises: is this state of tension in our plans really necessary for us? Cannot we do without it? Is it not possible to conduct the work at a slower pace,in a more “restful” atmosphere? Is not the fast rate of industrial development that we have adopted due to the restless character of the members of the PoliticalBureau and the Council of People’s Commissars? Of course not! The members of the Political Bureau and the Council of People’s Commissars are calm and sober people. 
 Abstractly speaking, that is, if we disre-garded the external and internal situation, we could, of course, conduct the work at a slower speed. 
 But the point is that, firstly, we cannot disregard the externaland internal situation, and, secondly, if we take the sur-rounding situation as our starting-point, it has to be ad-mitted that it is precisely this situation that dictatesa fast rate of development of our industry. 
 Permit me to pass to an examination of this situation, of these conditions of an external and internal orderthat dictate a fast rate of industrial development. 
 External conditions . 
 We have assumed power in a country whose technical equipment is terribly backward. 
Along with a few big industrial units more or less based upon modern technology, we have hundreds and thousands of mills and factories the technical equipment of which isbeneath all criticism from the point of view of modern achievements. 
 At the same time we have around us a num-ber of capitalist countries whose industrial technique is farmore developed and up-to-date than that of our country. 
 Look at the capitalist countries and you will see that their technology is not only advancing, but advancing by leapsand bounds, outstripping the old forms of industrial technique. 
 And so we find that, on the one hand, we in our country have the most advanced system, theSoviet system, and the most advanced type of state pow-er in the world, Soviet power, while, on the other hand, our industry, which should be the basis of socialism andof Soviet power, is extremely backward technically. 
 Do you think that we can achieve the final victory of socialism in our country so long as this contradiction exists? What has to be done to end this contradiction? To end it, we must overtake and outstrip the advanced technology of the developed capitalist countries. 
 We have overtaken and outstripped the advanced capitalistcountries in the sense of establishing a new political system, the Soviet system. 
 That is good. 
 But it is not enough. 
 In order to secure the final victory of socialismin our country, we must also overtake and outstrip these countries technically and economically. 
 Either we do this, or we shall be forced to the wall. 
 This applies not only to the building of socialism. 
 It applies also to upholding the independence of our country in the circumstances of the capitalist encircle-ment. 
 The independence of our country cannot be up-held unless we have an adequate industrial basis for de-fence. 
 And such an industrial basis cannot be createdif our industry is not more highly developed technically. 
 That is why a fast rate of development of our indus-try is necessary and imperative. 
 The technical and economic backwardness of our country was not invented by us. 
 This backwardness is age-old and was bequeathed to us by the whole historyof our country. 
 This backwardness was felt to be an evil both earlier, before the revolution, and later, aft-er the revolution. 
 When Peter the Great, having todeal with the more highly developed countries of the West, feverishly built mills and factories to supply the army and strengthen the country’s defences, thatwas in its way an attempt to break out of the grip of this backwardness. 
 It is quite understandable, however, that none of the old classes, neither the feudal aristoc-racy nor the bourgeoisie, could solve the problem of put-ting an end to the backwardness of our country. 
 Morethan that, not only were these classes unable to solve this problem, they were not even able to formulate the task in any satisfactory way. 
 The age-old backwardnessof our country can be ended only on the lines of success-ful socialist construction. 
 And it can be ended only by the proletariat, which has established its dictatorshipand has charge of the direction of the country. 
 It would be foolish to console ourselves with the thought that, since the backwardness of our country wasnot invented by us and was bequeathed to us by the whole history of our country, we cannot be, and do not have to be, responsible for it. 
 That is not true, comrades. 
 Since wehave come to power and taken upon ourselves the task of transforming the country on the basis of socialism, we are responsible, and have to be responsible, for every-thing, the bad as well as the good. 
 And just because we are responsible for everything, we must put an end to our technical and economic backwardness. 
 We mustdo so without fail if we really want to overtake and outstrip the advanced capitalist countries. 
 And only we Bolsheviks can do it. 
 But precisely in order to ac-complish this task, we must systematically achieve a fast rate of development of our industry. 
 And that we are already achieving a fast rate of industrial develop-ment is now clear to everyone. 
 The question of overtaking and outstripping the ad-vanced capitalist countries technically and economicallyis for us Bolsheviks neither new nor unexpected. 
 It was raised in our country as early as in 1917, before the October Revolution. 
 It was raised by Lenin as early as in September 1917, on the eve of the October Revo-lution, during the imperialist war, in his pamphletThe Impending Catastrophe and How to Combat It . 
 Here is what Lenin said on this score: “The result of the revolution has been that the p o l i t i c a l system of Russia has in a few months caught up with that of the advanced countries. 
 But that is not enough. 
 The war is inexo-rable; it puts the alternative with ruthless severity: either perish, or overtake and outstrip the advanced countries e c o n o m i-c a l l y a s w e l l . 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Perish or drive full-steam ahead. 
 That is the alternative with which history has confronted us” (V ol. 
 XXI, p. 
 191). 
 You see how bluntly Lenin put the question of end-ing our technical and economic backwardness. 
 Lenin wrote all this on the eve of the October Revo-lution, in the period before the proletariat had takenpower, when the Bolsheviks had as yet neither state power, nor a socialised industry, nor a widely ramified co-operative network embracing millions of peasants,nor collective farms, nor state farms. 
 Today, when we already have something substantial with which to end completely our technical and economic backwardness,we might paraphrase Lenin’s words roughly as follows: “We have overtaken and outstripped the advanced capitalist countries politically by establishing the dic-tatorship of the proletariat. 
 But that is not enough. 
 We must utilise the dictatorship of the proletariat, our socialised industry, transport, credit system, etc. 
, theco-operatives, collective farms, state farms, etc. 
, in order to overtake and outstrip the advanced capitalist countries economically as well. 
” The question of a fast rate of development of indus-try would not face us so acutely as it does now if we had such a highly developed industry and such a highlydeveloped technology as Germany, say, and if the rel-ative importance of industry in the entire national economy were as high in our country as it is in Germany,for example. 
 If that were the case , we could develop our industry at a slower rate without fearing to fall behind the capitalist countries and knowing that we could out-strip them at one stroke. 
 But then we should not be so seriously backward technically and economically as we are now. 
 The whole point is that we are behindGermany in this respect and are still far from having overtaken her technically and economically. 
 The question of a fast rate of development of indus-try would not face us so acutely if we were not the only country but one of the countries of the dictatorship of the proletariat, if there were a proletarian dictatorshipnot only in our country but in other, more advanced coun-tries as well, Germany and France, say. 
 If that were the case , the capitalist encirclement could not be so serious a danger as it is now, the question of the economic independence of our country would nat-urally recede into the background, we could integrateourselves into the system of more developed proletarian states, we could receive from them machines for making our industry and agriculture more productive, supplyingthem in turn with raw materials and foodstuffs, and we could, consequently, expand our industry at a slower rate. 
 But you know very well that that is not yet thecase and that we are still the only country of the pro-letarian dictatorship and are surrounded by capitalist countries, many of which are far in advance of us tech-nically and economically. 
 That is why Lenin raised the question of overtak-ing and outstripping the economically advanced coun-tries as one of life and death for our development. 
 Such are the external conditions dictating a fast rate of development of our industry. 
 Internal conditions . 
 But besides the external con-ditions, there are also internal conditions which dictatea fast rate of development of our industry as the main foundation of our entire national economy. 
 I am re-ferring to the extreme backwardness of our agriculture,of its technical and cultural level. 
 I am referring to the existence in our country of an overwhelming prepon-derance of small commodity producers, with their scat-tered and utterly backward production, compared with which our large-scale socialist industry is like an island in the midst of the sea, an island whose base is expandingdaily, but which is nevertheless an island in the midst of the sea. 
 We are in the habit of saying that industry is the main foundation of our entire national economy, in-cluding agriculture, that it is the key to the reconstruc-tion of our backward and scattered system of agricultureon a collectivist basis. 
 That is perfectly true. 
 From that position we must not retreat for a single moment. 
 But it must also be remembered that, while industryis the main foundation, agriculture constitutes the basis for industrial development, both as a market which absorbs the products of industry and as a supplier ofraw materials and foodstuffs, as well as a source of the export reserves essential in order to import machinery for the needs of our national economy. 
 Can we advance industry while leaving agriculture in a state of complete technical backwardness, without providing an agricul-tural base for industry, without reconstructing agri-culture and bringing it up to the level of industry? No, we cannot. 
 Hence the task of supplying agriculture with the maximum amount of instruments and means of pro-duction essential in order to accelerate and promoteits reconstruction on a new technical basis. 
 But for the accomplishment of this task a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary. 
 Of course, the reconstruc-tion of a disunited and scattered agriculture is an incompa-rably more difficult matter than the reconstruction of a united and centralised socialist industry. 
 But that is the task that confronts us, and we must accomplish it. 
 And it cannot be accomplished except by a fast rate of industrial development. 
 We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist con-struction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. 
 We mustgradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialistindustry. 
 Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be as-sured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplishit—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable. 
 Here is what Lenin says on this score: “As long as we live in a small-peasant country, there is a surer economic basis for capitalism in Russia than for communism. 
This must be borne in mind. 
 Anyone who has carefully observedlife in the countryside, as compared with life in the towns, knowsthat we have not torn out the roots of capitalism and have notundermined the foundation, the basis of the internal enemy. 
 Thelatter depends on small-scale production, and there is only oneway of undermining it, namely, to place the economy of the country,including agriculture, on a new technical basis, the technicalbasis of modern large-scale production. 
 And it is only electricitythat is such a basis. 
 Communism is Soviet power plus the electri-fication of the whole country” (V ol. 
 XXVI, p. 
 46). 
 As you see, when Lenin speaks of the electrifica-tion of the country he means not the isolated construc-tion of individual power stations, but the gradual “plac-ing of the economy of the country, including agricul-ture,* on a new technical basis, the technical basis of modern large-scale production,” which in one way oranother, directly or indirectly, is connected with elec-trification. 
 Lenin delivered this speech at the Eighth Congress of Soviets in December 1920, on the very eve of the in-troduction of NEP, when he was substantiating the so-called plan of electrification, that is, the GOELROplan. 
 Some comrades argue on these grounds that the views expressed in this quotation have become inap-plicable under present conditions. 
 Why, we ask? Because,they say, much water has flown under the bridges since then. 
 It is, of course, true that much water has * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 flown under the bridges since then. 
 We now have a de-veloped socialist industry, we have collective farms on a mass scale, we have old and new state farms, we have awide network of well-developed co-operative organisa-tions, we have machine-hiring stations at the service of the peasant farms, we now practise the contractsystem as a new form of the bond, and we can put into operation all these and a number of other levers for gradually placing agriculture on a new technicalbasis. 
 All this is true. 
 But it is also true that, in spite of all this, we are still a small-peasant country where small-scale production predominates. 
 And that is thefundamental thing. 
 And as long as it continues to be the fundamental thing, Lenin’s thesis remains valid that “as long as we live in a small-peasant country, thereis a surer economic basis for capitalism in Russia than for communism,” and that, consequently, the danger of the restoration of capitalism is no empty phrase. 
 Lenin says the same thing, but in a sharper form, in the plan of his pamphlet, The Tax in Kind , which was written after the introduction of NEP (March-April 1921): “I f we have electrification in 10-20 years, then the indi-vidualism of the small tiller, and freedom f o r h i m to trade locally are not a whit terrible. 
 I f we do not have electrification, a return to capitalism will be inevitable anyhow . 
” And further on he says: “Ten or twenty years of correct relations with the peasantry, and victory on a world scale is assured (even if the proletarian revolutions, which are growing, are delayed); otherwise, 20-40 years of the torments of whiteguard terrorism” (V ol. 
 XXVI, p. 
 313). 
 You see how bluntly Lenin puts the question: either electrification, that is, the “placing of the economy of the country, including agriculture, on a new techni-cal basis, the technical basis of modern large-scale pro-duction,” or a return to capitalism. 
 That is how Lenin understood the question of “cor-rect relations with the peasantry. 
” It is not a matter of coddling the peasant and re-garding this as establishing correct relations with him,for coddling will not carry you very far. 
 It is a matter of helping the peasant to place his husbandry “on a new technical basis, the technical basis of modern large-scale production”; for that is the principal way to rid the peasant of his poverty. 
 And it is impossible to place the economy of the country on a new technical basis unless our industry and, in the first place, the production of means of production, are developed at a fast rate. 
 Such are the internal conditions dictating a fast rate of development of our industry. 
 It is these external and internal conditions which are the cause of the control figures of our national econo-my being under such tension. 
 That explains, too, why our economic plans, both budgetary and non-budgetary, are marked by a state of tension, by substantial investments in capital devel-opment, the object of which is to maintain a fast rate ofindustrial development. 
 It may be asked where this is said in the theses, in what passage of the theses. 
 ( A voice : “Yes, where is it said?”) Evidence of this in the theses is the sum-total of capital investments in industry for 1928-29. 
 After all, our theses are called theses on the control figures. 
 That is so, is it not, comrades? ( A voice : “Yes. 
”) Well, the theses say that in 1928-29 we shall be investing1,650 million rubles in capital construction in indus-try. 
 In other words, this year we shall be investing in industry 330,000,000 rubles more than last year. 
 It follows, therefore, that we are not only main-taining the rate of industrial development, but are going a step farther by investing more in industry than lastyear, that is, by expanding capital construction in in-dustry both absolutely and relatively. 
 That is the crux of the theses on the control figures of the national economy. 
 Yet certain comrades failed to observe this staring fact. 
 They criticised the theses on the control figures right and left as regards pettydetails, but the most important thing they failed to observe. 
 II THE GRAIN PROBLEM I have spoken so far of the first main question in the theses, the rate of development of industry. 
 Now let usconsider the second main question, the grain problem. 
 A characteristic feature of the theses is that they lay stress on the problem of the development of agriculture in gen-eral, and of grain farming in particular. 
 Are the theses right in doing so? I think they are. 
 Already at the July plenum it was said that the weakest spot in thedevelopment of our national economy is the excessive backwardness of agriculture in general, and of grain farming in particular. 
 When, in speaking of our agriculture lagging be-hind our industry, people complain about it, they are, of course, not talking seriously. 
 Agriculture always haslagged and always: will lag behind industry. 
 That is particularly true in our conditions, where industry is concentrated to a maximum degree, while agricultureis scattered to a maximum degree. 
 Naturally, a united industry will develop faster than a scattered agricul-ture. 
 That, incidently, gives rise to the leading positionof industry in relation to agriculture. 
 Consequently, the customary lag of agriculture behind industry does not give sufficient grounds for raising the grain problem. 
 The problem of agriculture, and of grain farming in particular, makes its appearance only when the cus-tomary lag of agriculture behind industry turns intoan excessive lag in the rate of its development. 
 The char-acteristic feature of the present state of our national economy is that we are faced by the fact of an excessive lag in the rate of development of grain farming behind the rate of development of industry, while at the same time the demand for marketable grain on the part ofthe growing towns and industrial areas is increasing by leaps and bounds. 
 The task then is not to lower the rate of development of industry to the level of the de-velopment of grain farming (which would upset every-thing and reverse the course of development), but to bring the rate of development of grain farming into linewith the rate of development of industry and to raise the rate of development of grain farming to a level that will guarantee rapid progress of the entire nationaleconomy, both industry and agriculture. 
 Either we accomplish this task, and thereby solve the grain problem, or we do not accomplish it, and then a rupture between the socialist town and the small-peasant countryside will be inevitable. 
 That is how the matter stands, comrades. 
 That is the essence of the grain problem. 
 Does this not mean that what we have now is “stag-nation” in the development of agriculture or even its “retrogression”? That is what Frumkin actually asserts in his second letter, which at his request we distributedtoday to the members of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
 He says explicitly in this letter that there is “stagnation” in our agriculture. 
 “We cannot and must not,” he says,“talk in the press about retrogression, but within the Party we ought not to hide the fact that this lag is equiv-alent to retrogression. 
” Is this assertion of Frumkin’s correct? It is, of course, incorrect! We, the members of the Political Bureau, absolutely disagree with this assertion, and thePolitical Bureau theses are totally at variance with such an opinion of the state of grain farming. 
 In point of fact, what is retrogression, and how would it manifest itself in agriculture? It would obvious-ly be bound to manifest itself in a backward, downward movement of agriculture, a movement away from thenew forms of farming to the old, medieval forms. 
 It would be bound to manifest itself by the peasants aban-doning, for instance, the three-field system for the long-fallow system, the steel plough and machines for the wooden plough, clean and selected seed for unsifted and low-grade seed, modern methods of farming for inferiormethods, and so on and so forth. 
 But do we observe any-thing of the kind? Does not everyone know that tens and hundreds of thousands of peasant farms are annually abandoning the three-field for the four-field and multi-field system, low-grade seed for selected seed, thewooden plough for the steel plough and machines, in-ferior methods of farming for superior methods? Is this retrogression? Frumkin has a habit of hanging on to the coat tails of some member or other of the Political Bureau in order to substantiate his own point of view. 
 It is quite likelythat in this instance, too, he will get hold of Bukha-rin’s coat tails in order to show that Bukharin in his article, “Notes of an Economist,” says “the same thing. 
”But what Bukharin says is very far from “the same thing. 
” Bukharin in his article raised the abstract, theoretical question of the possibility or danger of retrogression. 
In the abstract, such a formulation of the question is quite possible and legitimate. 
 But what does Frumkin do? He turns the abstract question of the possibilityof the retrogression of agriculture into a fact. 
 And this he calls an analysis of the state of grain farming! Is it not ludicrous, comrades? It would be a fine Soviet government indeed if, in the eleventh year of its existence, it had brought agriculture into a state of retrogression! Why, a govern-ment like that would deserve not to be supported, but to be sent packing. 
 And the workers would have sent such a government packing long ago, if it had reducedagriculture to a state of retrogression. 
 Retrogression is a tune all sorts of bourgeois experts are harping on; they dream of our agriculture retrogressing. 
 Trotskyat one time harped on the theme of retrogression. 
 I did not expect to see Frumkin taking this dubious line. 
 On what does Frumkin base his assertion about ret-rogression? First of all, on the fact that the grain crop area this year is less than it was last year. 
 What is thisfact due to? To the policy of the Soviet Government, perhaps? Of course not. 
 It is due to the perishing of the winter crops in the steppe area of the Ukraine and par-tially in the North Caucasus, and to the drought in the summer of this year in the same area of the Ukraine. 
 Had it not been for these unfavourable weather conditions,upon which agriculture is wholly and entirely depend-ent, our grain crop area this year would have been at least 1,000,000 dessiatins larger than it was last year. 
 He bases his assertion, further, on the fact that our gross production of grain this year is only slightly (70,000,000 poods) greater, and that of wheat and rye200,000,000 poods less, than last year. 
 And what is all this due to? Again to the drought and to the frosts which killed the winter crops. 
 Had it not been for theseunfavourable weather conditions, our gross production of grain this year would have exceeded last year’s by 300,000,000 poods. 
 How can one ignore such factorsas drought, frost, etc. 
, which are of decisive signifi-cance for the harvest in this or that region? We are now making it our task to enlarge the crop area by 7 per cent, to raise crop yields by 3 per cent, and to increase the gross production of grain by, I think, 10 per cent. 
 There need be no doubt that we shall do-everything in our power to accomplish these tasks. 
 But- in spite of all our measures, it is not out of the ques-tion that we may again come up against a partial cropfailure, frosts or drought in this or that region, in which case it is possible that these circumstances may cause the gross grain output to fall short of our plans or even of this year’s gross output. 
 Will that mean that agri-culture is “retrogressing,” that the policy of the SovietGovernment is to blame for this “retrogression,” that we have “robbed” the peasant of economic incentive, that we have “deprived” him of economic prospects? Several years ago Trotsky fell into the same error, declaring that “a little rain” was of no significance to agriculture. 
 Rykov controverted him, and had the sup-port of the overwhelming majority of the members of the C. 
C. 
 Now Frumkin is falling into the same error, ignoring weather conditions, which are of decisive im-portance for agriculture, and trying to make the policy of our Party responsible for everything. 
 What ways and means are necessary to accelerate the rate of development of agriculture in general, and of grain farming in particular? There are three such ways, or channels:a) by increasing crop yields and enlarging the area sown by the individual poor and middle peasants; b) by further development of collective farms;c) by enlarging the old and establishing new state farms. 
 All this was already mentioned in the resolution of the July plenum. 
 The theses repeat what was said at the July plenum, but put the matter more concretely, and state it in terms of figures in the shape of definiteinvestments. 
 Here, too, Frumkin finds something to cavil at. 
 He thinks that, since individual farming is put in the first place and the collective farms and state farmsin the second and third, this can only mean that his view-point has triumphed. 
 That is ridiculous, comrades. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR It is clear that if we approach the matter from the point of view of the relative importance of each form of agri-culture, individual farming must be put in the firstplace, because it provides nearly six times as much marketable grain as the collective farms and state farms. 
 But if we approach the matter from the point of viewof the type of farming, of which form of economy is most akin to our purpose, first place must be given to the collective farms and state farms, which representa higher type of agriculture than individual peasant farming. 
 Is it really necessary to show that both points of view are equally acceptable to us? What is required in order that our work should proceed along all these three channels, in order that the rate of development of agriculture, and primarily ofgrain farming, should be raised in practice? It is necessary, first of all, to direct the attention of our Party cadres to agriculture and focus it on con-crete aspects of the grain problem. 
 We must put aside abstract phrases and talking about agriculture in general and get down, at last, to working out practical meas-ures for the furtherance of grain farming adapted to the diverse conditions in the different areas. 
 It is time to pass from words to deeds and to tackle at last theconcrete question how to raise crop yields and to en-large the crop areas of the individual poor-and middle-peasant farms, how to improve and develop further the collective farms and state farms, how to organise the ren-dering of assistance by the collective farms and state farms to the peasants by way of supplying them withbetter seed and better breeds of cattle, how to organise assistance for the peasants in the shape of machines and other implements through machine-hiring stations, how to extend and improve the contract system and ag-ricultural co-operation in general, and so on and so forth. 
(A voice : “That is empiricism. 
”) Such empiricism is absolutely essential, for otherwise we run the risk of drowning the very serious matter of solving the grainproblem in empty talk about agriculture in general. 
 The Central Committee has set itself the task of arranging for concrete reports on agricultural develop-ment by our principal workers in the Council of People’s Commissars and the Political Bureau who are respon-sible for the chief grain regions. 
 At this plenum youare to hear a report by Comrade Andreyev on the ways of solving the grain problem in the North Caucasus. 
 I think that we shall next have to hear similar reportsin succession from the Ukraine, the Central Black Earth region, the Volga region, Siberia, etc. 
 This is absolute-ly necessary in order to turn the Party’s attention tothe grain problem and to get our Party workers at last to formulate concretely the questions connected with the grain problem. 
 It is necessary, in the second place, to ensure that our Party workers in the countryside make a strict dis-tinction in their practical work between the middlepeasant and the kulak, do not lump them together and do not hit the middle peasant when it is the kulak that has to be struck at. 
 It is high time to puta stop to these errors, if they may be called such. 
 Take, for instance, the question of the individual tax. 
 We have the decision of the Political Bureau, and the cor-responding law, about levying an individual tax on not more than 2-3 per cent of the households, that is, on the wealthiest section of the kulaks. 
 But what actually happens? There are a number of districts where 10, 12 and even more per cent of the households are taxed, with theresult that the middle section of the peasantry is af-fected. 
 Is it not time to put a stop to this crime? Yet, instead of indicating concrete measures for putting a stop to these and similar outrages, our dear “critics” indulge in word play, proposing that the words “the wealthiest section of the kulaks” be replaced bythe words “the most powerful section of the kulaks” or “the uppermost section of the kulaks. 
” As if it were not one and the same thing! It has been shown that thekulaks constitute about 5 per cent of the peasantry. 
 It has been shown that the law requires the individual tax to be levied on only 2-3 per cent of the households,that is, on the wealthiest section of the kulaks. 
 It has been shown that in practice this law is being violated in a number of areas. 
 Yet, instead of indicating concretemeasures for putting a stop to this, the “critics” indulge in verbal criticism and refuse to understand that this does not alter things one iota. 
 Sheer hair-splitters! ( A voice : “They propose that the individual tax should be levied on all kulaks. 
”) Well then, they should demand the re-peal of the law imposing an individual tax on 2-3 percent. 
 Yet I have not heard that anybody has demanded the repeal of the individual tax law. 
 It is said that individual taxation is arbitrarily extended in order to supplementthe local budget. 
 But you must not supplement the local budget by breaking the law, by infringing Party direc-tives. 
 Our Party exists, it has not been liquidated yet. 
The Soviet Government exists, it has not been liquidated yet. 
 And if you have not enough funds for your local budget, then you must ask to have your local budget reconsidered, and not break the law or disregard Party instructions. 
 It is necessary, next, to give further incentives to individual poor-and middle-peasant farming. 
 Undoubt-edly, the increase in grain prices already introduced,practical enforcement of revolutionary law, practical assistance to the poor-and middle-peasant farms in the shape of the’ contract system, and so on, willconsiderably increase the peasant’s economic incentive. 
 Frumkin thinks that we have killed or nearly killed the peasant’s incentive by robbing him of economicprospects. 
 That, of course, is nonsense. 
 If it were true, it would be incomprehensible what the bond, the alli-ance between the working class and the main mass of thepeasantry, actually rests on. 
 It cannot be thought, sure-ly, that this alliance rests on sentiment. 
 It must be realised, after all, that the alliance between the workingclass and the peasantry is an alliance on a business basis, an alliance of the interests of two classes, a class alli-ance of the workers and the main mass of the peasantryaiming at mutual advantage. 
 It is obvious that if we had killed or nearly killed the peasant’s economic in-centive by depriving him of economic prospects, therewould be no bond, no alliance between the working class and the peasantry. 
 Clearly, what is at issue here is not the “creation” or “release” of the economic incentive ofthe poor-and middle-peasant masses, but the strength-ening and further development of this incentive, to the mutual advantage of the working class and the main massof the peasantry. 
 And that is precisely what the theses on the control figures of the national economy indicate. 
 It is necessary, lastly, to increase the supply of goods to the countryside. 
 I have in mind both consumer goods and, especiaIly, production goods (machines, fertilis-ers, etc. 
) capable of increasing the output of agricul-tural produce. 
 It cannot be said that everything in this respect is as it should be. 
 You know that symptoms ofa goods shortage are still far from having been elimi-nated, and will probably not be eliminated so soon. 
 The illusion exists in certain Party circles that we can putan end to the goods shortage at once. 
 That, unfortunate-ly, is not true. 
 It should be borne in mind that the symp-toms of a goods shortage are connected, firstly, with thegrowing prosperity of the workers and peasants and the gigantic increase of effective demand for goods, pro-duction of which is growing year by year but which arenot enough to satisfy the whole demand, and, second-ly, with the present period of the reconstruction of in-dustry. 
 The reconstruction of industry involves the trans-fer of funds from the sphere of producing means of con-sumption to the sphere of producing means of production. 
Without this there can be no serious reconstruction of industry, especially in our, Soviet conditions. 
 But what does this mean? It means that money is being in-vested in the building of new plants, and that the num-ber of towns and new consumers is growing, while the new plants can put out additional commodities inquantity only after three or four years. 
 It is easy to real-ise that this is not conducive to putting an end to the goods shortage. 
 Does this mean that we must fold our arms and ac-knowledge that we are impotent to cope with the symp-toms of a goods shortage? No, it does not. 
 The fact is that we can and should adopt concrete measures to mitigate, to moderate the goods shortage. 
 That is something wecan and should do at once. 
 For this, we must speed up the expansion of those branches of industry which di-rectly contribute to the promotion of agricultural pro-duction (the Stalingrad Tractor Works, the Rostov Ag-ricultural Machinery Works, the V oronezh Seed Sort-ter Factory, etc. 
, etc. 
). 
 For this, further, we must as faras possible expand those branches of industry which con-tribute to an increase in output of goods in short supply (cloth, glass, nails, etc. 
). 
 And so on and so forth. 
 Kubyak said that the control figures of the nation-al economy propose to assign less funds this year to individual peasant farming than last year. 
 That, I think,is untrue. 
 Kubyak apparently loses sight of the fact that this year we are giving the peasants credit under the contract system to the sum of about 300,000,000 rubles(nearly 100,000,000 more than last year). 
 If this is taken into account, and it must be taken into account, it will be seen that this year we are assigning morefor the development of individual peasant farming than last year. 
 As to the old and new state farms and collective farms, we are investing in them this yearabout 300,000,000 rubles (some 150,000,000 more than last year). 
 Special attention needs to be paid to the collective farms, the state farms and the contract system. 
 These things should not be regarded only as means of increasing our stocks of marketable grain. 
 They are at the sametime a new form of bond between the working class and the main mass of the peasantry. 
 Enough has already been said about the contract system and I shall not dwell upon it any further. 
 Everyone realises that the application of this system ona mass scale makes it easier to unite the efforts of the individual peasant farms, introduces an element of permanency in the relations between the state and thepeasantry, and so strengthens the bond between town and country. 
 I should like to draw your attention to the collec-tive farms, and especially to the state farms, as levers which facilitate the reconstruction of agriculture on a new technical basis, causing a revolution in the mindsof the peasants and helping them to shake off conserv-atism, routine. 
 The appearance of tractors, large agri-cultural machines and tractor columns in our grainregions cannot but have its effect on the surrounding peasant farms. 
 Assistance rendered the surrounding peas-ants in the way of seed, machines and tractors will un-doubtedly be appreciated by the peasants and taken as a sign of the power and strength of the Soviet state, which is trying to lead them on to the high road of asubstantial improvement of agriculture. 
 We have not taken this circumstance into account until now and, perhaps, still do not sufficiently do so. 
 But I thinkthat this is the chief thing that the collective farms and state farms are contributing and could contribute at the present moment towards solving the grain problem andthe strengthening of the bond in its new forms. 
 Such, in general, are the ways and means that we must adopt in our work of solving the grain problem. 
 III COMBATING DEVIATIONS AND CONCILIATION TOWARDS THEM Let us pass now to the third main question of our theses, that of deviations from the Leninist line. 
 The social basis of the deviations is the fact that small-scale production predominates in our country, the factthat small-scale production gives rise to capitalist ele-ments, the fact that our Party is surrounded by petty-bourgeois elemental forces, and, lastly, the fact that cer-tain of our Party organisations have been infected by these elemental forces. 
 There, in the main, lies the social basis of the devia-tions. 
 All these deviations are of a petty-bourgeois char-acter. 
 What is the Right deviation, which is the one chiefly in question here? In what direction does it tend to go? It tends towards adaptation to bourgeois ideology, to-wards adaptation of our policy to the tastes and require-ments of the “Soviet” bourgeoisie. 
 What threat does the Right deviation hold out, if it should triumph in our Party? It would mean the ideo-logical rout of our Party, a free rein for the capital-ist elements, the growth of chances for the restoration ofcapitalism, or, as Lenin called it, for a “return to capi-talism. 
” Where is the tendency towards a Right deviation chiefly lodged? In our Soviet, economic, co-operative and trade-union apparatuses, and in the Party appara-tus as well, especially in its lower links in the country-side. 
 Are there spokesmen of the Right deviation among our Party members? There certainly are. 
 Rykov men-tioned the example of Shatunovsky, who declared against the building of the Dnieper Hydro-Electric Power Station. 
There can be no question but that Shatunovsky was guilty of a Right deviation, a deviation towards open opportu-nism. 
 All the same, I think that Shatunovsky is not atypical illustration of the Right deviation, of its physiog-nomy. 
 I think that in this respect the palm should go to Frumkin. 
 ( Laughter . 
) I am referring to his first letter (June 1928) and then to his second letter, which was distributed here to the members of the C. 
C. 
 and C. 
C. 
C. 
 (November 1928). 
 Let us examine both these letters. 
 Let us take the “basic propositions” of the first letter. 
 1) “ The sentiment in the countryside , apart from a small section of the poor peasants , is opposed to us . 
” Is that true? It is obviously untrue. 
 If it were true, the bond would not even be a memory. 
 But since June(the letter was written in June) nearly six months have passed, yet anyone, unless he is blind, can see that the bond between the working class and the main massof the peasantry continues and is growing stronger. 
 Why does Frumkin write such nonsense? In order to scare the Party and make it give way to the Right deviation. 
 2) “The line taken lately has led to the main mass of the middle peasants being without hope , without prospects . 
” Is that true? It is quite untrue. 
 It is obvious thatif in the spring of this year the main mass of the middle peasants had been without economic hope or prospects they would not have enlarged the spring crop area as they did in all the principal grain-growing regions. 
 The spring sowing takes place in April-May. 
Well, Frumkin’s letter was written in June. 
 In our country, under the Soviet regime, who is the chief pur-chaser of cereals? The state and the co-operatives, whichare linked with the state. 
 It is obvious that if the mass of middle peasants had been without economic pros-pects, if they were in a state of “estrangement” fromthe Soviet Government, they would not have enlarged the spring crop area for the benefit of the state, as the principal purchaser of grain. 
 Frumkin is talking obviousnonsense. 
 Here again he is trying to scare the Party with the “horrors” of hopeless prospects in order to make it give way to his, Frumkin’s, view. 
 3) “We must return to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Congresses. 
 ” That the Fifteenth Congress has simply been tacked on here without rhyme or reason, of thatthere can be no doubt. 
 The crux here is not in the Fif-teenth Congress, but in the slogan: Back to the Four-teenth Congress. 
 And what does that mean? It meansrenouncing “intensification of the offensive against the kulak” (see Fifteenth Congress resolution). 
 I say this not in order to deprecate the Fourteenth Congress. 
 I sayit because, in calling for a return to the Fourteenth Con-gress, Frumkin is rejecting the step forward which the Party made between the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Con-gresses, and, in rejecting it, he is trying to pull the Party back. 
 The July plenum of the Central Committee pronounced its opinion on this question. 
 It stated plainlyin its resolution that people who try to evade the Fif-teenth Congress decision—“to develop further the of-fensive against the kulaks”—are “an expression of bour-geois tendencies in our country. 
” I must tell Frumkin plainly that when the Political Bureau formulated thisitem of the resolution of the July plenum, it had him and his first letter in mind. 
 4) “Maximum assistance to the poor peasants enter-ing collectives . 
” We have always to the best of our ability and resources rendered the maximum assistance to the poor peasants entering, or even not entering,collectives. 
 There is nothing new in this. 
 What is new in the Fifteenth Congress decisions compared with those of the Fourteenth Congress is not this but thatthe Fifteenth Congress made the utmost development of the collective-farm movement one of the cardinal tasks of the day. 
 When Frumkin speaks of maximumassistance to the poor peasants entering collectives, he is in point of fact turning away from, evading, the task set the Party by the Fifteenth Congress of devel-oping the collective-farm movement to the utmost. 
 In point of fact, Frumkin is against developing the work of strengthening the socialist sector in the countrysidealong the line of collective farms. 
 5) “State farms should not be expanded by shock or super-shock tactics . 
” Frumkin cannot but know that we are only beginning to work seriously to expand the old state farms and to create new ones. 
 Frumkin cannot but know that we are assigning for this purpose far lessmoney than we ought to assign if we had any reserves for it. 
 The words “by shock or super-shock tactics” were put in here to strike people with “horror” andto conceal his own disinclination for any serious ex-pansion of the state farms. 
 Frumkin, in point of fact, is here expressing his opposition to strengthening the so-cialist sector in the countryside along the line of the state farms. 
 Now gather all these propositions of Frumkin’s together, and you get a bouquet characteristic of the Right deviation. 
 Let us pass to Frumkin’s second letter. 
 In what way does the second letter differ from the first? In that it aggravates the errors of the first letter. 
 The first saidthat middle-peasant farming was without prospects. 
 The second speaks of the “retrogression” of agriculture. 
 The first letter said that we must return to the FourteenthCongress in the sense of relaxing the offensive against the kulak. 
 The second letter, however, says that “we must not hamper production on the kulak farms. 
” Thefirst letter said nothing about industry. 
 But the second letter develops a “new” theory to the effect that less should be assigned for industrial construction. 
 Inci-dentally, there are two points on which the two letters agree: concerning the collective farms and concerning the state farms. 
 In both letters Frumkin pronouncesagainst the development of collective farms and state farms. 
 It is clear that the second letter aggravates the errors of the first. 
 About the theory of “retrogression” I have already spoken. 
 There can be no doubt that this theory is the invention of bourgeois experts, who are always ready toraise a cry that the Soviet regime is doomed. 
 Frumkin has allowed himself to be scared by the bourgeois ex-perts who have their roost around the People’s Commis-sariat of Finance, and now he is himself trying to scare the Party so as to make it give way to the Right deviation. 
 Enough has been said, too, about the collec-tive farms and state farms. 
 So there is no need to repeat it. 
 Let us examine the two remaining points: aboutkulak farming and about capital investment in industry. 
 Kulak farming . 
 Frumkin says that “ we must not ham-per production on the kulak farms . 
” What does that mean? It means not preventing the kulaks from develop-ing their exploiting economy. 
 But what does not prevent-ing the kulaks from developing their exploiting economymean? It means allowing a free rein to capitalism in the countryside, allowing it freedom, liberty. 
 We get the old slogan of the French liberals: “laissez faire, laissezpasser,” that is, do not prevent the bourgeoisie from doing its business, do not prevent the bourgeoisie from moving freely. 
 This slogan was put forward by the old French lib-erals at the time of the French bourgeois revolution,at the time of the struggle against the feudal regime,which was fettering the bourgeoisie and not allowing it to develop. 
 It follows, then, that we must now go over from the socialist slogan— “ever-increasing restrictions on the capitalist elements” (see the theses on the control figures)— to the bourgeois-liberal slogan: do not hamper the development of capitalism in the countryside. 
 Why, are we really thinking of turning from Bolsheviks into bourgeois liberals? What can there be in common be-tween this bourgeois-liberal slogan of Frumkin’s and theline of the Party? (Frumkin . 
 “Comrade Stalin, read the other points also. 
”) I shall read the whole point: “We must nothamper production on the kulak farms either, while at the same time combating their enslaving exploitation . 
” My dear Frumkin, do you really think the second part of the sentence improves matters and does not make them worse? What does combating enslaving exploita-tion mean? Why, the slogan of combating enslaving ex-ploitation is a slogan of the bourgeois revolution, direct-ed against feudal-serf or semi-feudal methods of exploi-tation. 
 We did indeed put forward this slogan when we were advancing towards the bourgeois revolution, differ-entiating between the enslaving form of exploitation,which we were striving to abolish, and the non-enslaving, so-called “progressive” form of exploitation, which we could not at that time restrict or abolish, inasmuchas the bourgeois system remained in force. 
 But at that time we were advancing towards a bourgeois-democratic republic. 
 Now, however, if I am not mistaken, we havea socialist revolution, which is heading, and cannot but I head, for the abolition of all forms of exploitation, in-cluding “progressive” forms. 
 Really, do you want usto turn back from the socialist revolution, which we are developing and advancing, and revert to the slogans of the bourgeois revolution? How can one bring oneselfto talk such nonsense? Further, what does not hampering kulak economy mean? It means giving the kulak a free hand. 
 And whatdoes giving the kulak a free hand mean? It means giving him power. 
 When the French bourgeois liberals demanded that the feudal government should not hamper the de-velopment of the bourgeoisie, they expressed it concrete-ly in the demand that the bourgeoisie should be given power. 
 And they were right. 
 In order to be able to de-velop properly, the bourgeoisie must have power. 
 Conse-quently, to be consistent, you should say: admit the kulak to power. 
 For it must be understood, after all, that you cannot but restrict the development of kulak economy if you take power away from the kulaks andconcentrate it in the hands of the working class. 
 Those are the conclusions that suggest themselves on reading Frumkin’s second letter. 
 Capital construction in industry . 
 When we discussed the control figures we had three figures before us: the Supreme Council of National Economy asked for825,000,000 rubles; the State Planning Commission was willing to give 750,000,000 rubles; the People’s Com-missariat of Finance would give only 650,000,000 rubles. 
What decision on this did the Central Committee of our Party adopt? It fixed the figure at 800,000,000 ru-bles, that is, exactly 150,000,000 rubles more than thePeople’s Commissariat of Finance proposed. 
 That the People’s Commissariat of Finance offered less is, of course, not surprising: the stinginess of the People’sCommissariat of Finance is generally known; it has to be stingy. 
 But that is not the point just now. 
 The point is that Frumkin defends the figure of 650,000,000 rublesnot out of stinginess, but because of his new-fangled theory of “feasibility,” asserting in his second letter and in a special article in the periodical of the People’sCommissariat of Finance that we shall certainly do injury to our economy if we assign to the Supreme Council of National Economy more than 650,000,000 rubles for capitalconstruction . 
 And what does that mean? It means that Frumkin is against maintaining the present rate of the development of industry, evidently failing to realise thatif it were slackened this really would do injury to our entire national economy. 
 Now combine these two points in Frumkin’s second letter, the point concerning kulak farming and the point concerning capital construction in industry, add thetheory of “retrogression,” and you get the physiognomy of the Right deviation. 
 You want to know what the Right deviation is and what it looks like? Read Frumkin’s two letters, study them, and you will understand. 
 So much for the physiognomy of the Right deviation. 
But the theses speak not only of the Right devia-tion. 
 They speak also of the so-called “Left” deviation. 
 What is the “Left” deviation? Is there really a so-called“Left” deviation in the Party? Are there in our Party, as our theses say, anti-middle-peasant trends, super-industrialisation trends and so on? Yes, there are. 
 Whatdo they amount to? They amount to a deviation towards Trotskyism. 
 That was said already by the July plenum. 
 I am referring to the July plenum’s resolution on grainprocurement policy, which speaks of a struggle on two fronts: against those who want to hark back from the Fifteenth Congress—the Rights, and against those whowant to convert the emergency measures into a per-manent policy of the Party—the “Lefts,” the trend towards Trotskyism. 
 Clearly, there are elements of Trotskyism and a trend towards the Trotskyist ideology within our Party. 
 About four thousand persons, I think, voted againstour platform during the discussion which preceded the Fifteenth Party Congress. 
 ( A voice : “Ten thousand. 
”) I think that if ten thousand voted against, then twiceten thousand Party members who sympathise with Trots-kyism did not vote at all, because they did not attend the meetings. 
 These are the Trotskyist elements who have not left the Party, and who, it must be supposed, have not yet rid themselves of the Trotskyist ideology. 
Furthermore, I think that a section of the Trotskyists who later broke away from the Trotskyist organisation and returned to the Party have not yet succeeded in shak-ing off the Trotskyist ideology and are also, presuma-bly, not averse to disseminating their views among Party members. 
 Lastly, there is the fact that we have a certainrecrudescence of the Trotskyist ideology in some of our Party organisations. 
 Combine all this, and you get all the necessary elements for a deviation towards Trotskyismin the Party. 
 And that is understandable: with the existence of petty-bourgeois elemental forces, and the pressure thatthese forces exert on our Party, there cannot but be Trotskyist trends in it. 
 It is one thing to arrest Trotskyist cadres or expel them from the Party. 
 It is another thingto put an end to the Trotskyist ideology. 
 That will be more difficult. 
 And we say that wherever there is a Right deviation, there is bound to be also a “Left” deviation. 
The “Left” deviation is the shadow of the Right devia-tion. 
 Lenin used to say, referring to the Otzovists, that the “Lefts” are Mensheviks, only turned inside-out. 
That is quite true. 
 The same thing must be said of the present “Lefts. 
” People who deviate towards Trotskyism are in fact also Rights, only turned inside-out, Rightswho cloak themselves with “Left” phrases. 
 Hence the fight on two fronts—both against the Right deviation and against the “Left” deviation. 
 It may be said: if the “Left” deviation is in essence the same thing as the Right opportunist deviation, then what is the difference between them, and where do you actually get two fronts? Indeed, if a victory of the Rights means increasing the chances of the restoration of capi-talism, and a victory of the “Lefts” would lead to the same result, what difference is there between them, and why are some called Rights and others “Lefts”? And ifthere is a difference between them, what is it? Is it not true that the two deviations have the same social roots, that they are both petty-bourgeois deviations? Is itnot true that both these deviations, if they were to triumph, would lead to one and the same result? What, then, is the difference between them? The difference is in their platforms, their demands, their approach and their methods. 
 If, for example, the Rights say: “ It was a mistake to build the Dnieper Hydro-Electric Power Station ,” and the “Lefts,” on the contrary, declare: “ What is the use of one Dnieper Hydro-Electric Power Station , let us have a Dnieper Hydro-Electric Power Station every year ” (laugh-ter), it must be admitted that there obviously is a difference. 
 If the Rights say: “ Let the kulak alone , allow him to develop freely ,” and the “Lefts,” on the contrary, declare: “ Strike not only at the kulak , but also at the middle peasant , because he is just as much a private owner as the kulak ,” it must be admitted that there obviously is a difference. 
 If the Rights say: “ Difficulties have arisen , is it not time to quit? ” and the “Lefts,” on the contrary, declare: “ What are difficulties to us , a fig for your dif-ficulties—full speed ahead! ” (laughter ), it must be ad-mitted that there obviously is a difference. 
 There you have a picture of the specific platform and the specific methods of the “Lefts. 
” This, in fact, explains why the “Lefts” sometimes succeed in luringa part of the workers over to their side with the help of high-sounding “Left” phrases and by posing as the most determined opponents of the Rights, although allthe world knows that they, the “Lefts,” have the same social roots as the Rights, and that they not infrequent-ly join in an agreement, a bloc, with the Rights in or-der to fight the Leninist line. 
 That is why it is obligatory for us, Leninists, to wage a fight on two fronts—both against the Rightdeviation and against the “Left” deviation. 
 But if the Trotskyist trend represents a “Left” de-viation, does not this mean that the “Lefts” are more tothe Left than Leninism? No, it does not. 
 Leninism is the most Left (without quotation marks) trend in the world labour movement. 
 We Leninists belonged to theSecond International down to the outbreak of the impe-rialist war as the extreme Left group of the Social-Democrats. 
 We did not remain in the Second Internation-al and we advocated a split in the Second International precisely because, being the extreme Left group, we did not want to be in the same party as the petty-bourgeoistraitors to Marxism, the social-pacifists and social-chau-vinists. 
 It was these tactics and this ideology that subse-quently became the basis of all the Bolshevik parties of the world. 
 In our Party, we Leninists are the sole Lefts without quotation marks. 
 Consequently, we Lenin-ists are neither “Lefts” nor Rights in our own Party. 
 We are a party of Marxist-Leninists. 
 And within our Party we combat not only those whom we call openly opportunist deviators, but also those who pretend to be “Lefter” than Marxism, “Lefter” than Leninism, andwho camouflage their Right, opportunist nature with high-sounding “Left” phrases. 
 Everybody realises that when people who have not yet rid themselves of Trotskyist trends are called “Lefts,” it is meant ironically. 
 Lenin referred to the “Left Com-munists” as Lefts sometimes with and sometimes with-out quotation marks. 
 But everyone realises that Lenin called them Lefts ironically, thereby emphasising that they were Lefts only in words, in appearance, butthat in reality they represented petty-bourgeois Right trends. 
 In what possible sense can the Trotskyist elements be called Lefts (without quotation marks), if only yes-terday they joined in a united anti-Leninist bloc with openly opportunist elements and linked themselvesdirectly and immediately with the anti-Soviet strata of the country? Is it not a fact that only yesterday we had an open bloc of the “Lefts” and the Rights againstthe Leninist Party, and that that bloc undoubtedly had the support of the bourgeois elements? And does not this show that they, the “Lefts” and the Rights,could not have joined together in a united bloc if they did not have common social roots, if they were not of a common opportunist nature? The Trotskyist bloc fellto pieces a year ago. 
 Some of the Rights, such as Shatu-novsky, left the bloc. 
 Consequently, the Right members of the bloc will now come forward as Rights, while the“Lefts” will camouflage their Rightism with “Left” phrases. 
 But what guarantee is there that the “Lefts” and the Rights will not find each other again? ( Laughter . 
) Obviously, there is not, and cannot be, any guarantee of that. 
 But if we uphold the slogan of a fight on two fronts, does this mean that we are proclaiming the necessity of Centrism in our Party? What does a fight on two fronts mean? Is this not Centrism? You know that that is exact-ly how the Trotskyists depict matters: there are the “Lefts,” that is, “we,” the Trotskyists, the “real Lenin-ists”; there are the “Rights,” that is, all the rest; and, lastly, there are the “Centrists,” who vacillate between the “Lefts” and the Rights. 
 Can that be consid-ered a correct view of our Party? Obviously not. 
 Only people who have become confused in all their concepts and who have long ago broken with Marxism can say that. 
 Itcan be said only by people who fail to see and to under-stand the difference in principle between the Social-Demo-cratic party of the pre-war period, which was the party ofa bloc of proletarian and petty-bourgeois interests, and the Communist Party, which is the monolithic party of the revolutionary proletariat. 
 Centrism must not be regarded as a spatial concept: the Rights, say, sitting on one side, the “Lefts” on the other, and the Centrists in between. 
 Centrism is a po-litical concept. 
 Its ideology is one of adaptation, of sub-ordination of the interests of the proletariat to the in-terests of the petty bourgeoisie within one common party . 
 This ideology is alien and abhorrent to Leninism. 
 Centrism was a phenomenon that was natural in the Second International of the period before the war. 
 Therewere Rights (the majority), Lefts (without quotation marks), and Centrists, whose whole policy consisted in embellishing the opportunism of the Rights with Left phrases and subordinating the Lefts to the Rights. 
 What, at that time, was the policy of the Lefts, of whom the Bolsheviks constituted the core? It was one of determinedly fighting the Centrists, of fighting for a split with the Rights (especially after the outbreakof the imperialist war) and of organising a new, revolu-tionary International consisting of genuinely Left, gen-uinely proletarian elements. 
 Why was it possible that there could arise at that time such an alignment of forces within the Second International and such a policy of the Bolsheviks with-in it? Because the Second International was at that time the party of a bloc of proletarian and petty-bour-geois interests serving the interests of the petty-bour-geois social-pacifists, social-chauvinists. 
 Because the Bolsheviks could not at that time but concentrate their fire on the Centrists, who were trying to subordinate theproletarian elements to the interests of the petty bour-geoisie. 
 Because the Bolsheviks were obliged at that time to advocate the idea of a split, for otherwise the prole-tarians could not have organised their own monolithic revolutionary Marxist party. 
 Can it be asserted that there is a similar alignment of forces in our Communist Party, and that the same policy must be practised in it as was practised by the Bolsheviks in the parties of the Second Internationalof the period before the war? Obviously not. 
 It cannot, because it would signify a failure to understand the dif-ference in principle between Social-Democracy, as the party of a bloc of proletarian and petty-bourgeois ele-ments, and the monolithic Communist Party of the revo-lutionary proletariat. 
 They (the Social-Democrats) had one underlying class basis for the party. 
 We (the Com-munists) have an entirely different underlying basis. 
With them (the Social-Democrats) Centrism was a nat-ural phenomenon, because the party of a bloc of heter-ogeneous interests cannot get along without Centrists,and the Bolsheviks were obliged to work for a split. 
 With us (the Communists) Centrism is purposeless and incompatible with the Leninist Party principle,since the Communist Party is the monolithic party of the proletariat, and not the party of a bloc of heteroge-neous class elements. 
 And since the prevailing force in our Party is the most Left of the trends in the world labour movement (the Leninists), a splitting policy in our Party has notand cannot have any justification from the standpoint of Leninism. 
 ( A voice : “Is a split possible in our Party, or not?”) The point is not whether a split is possible;the point is that a splitting policy in our monolithic Leninist Party cannot be justified from the standpoint of Leninism. 
 Whoever fails to understand this difference in prin-ciple is going against Leninism and is breaking with Leninism. 
 That is why I think that only people who have taken leave of their senses and have lost every shred of Marxism can seriously assert that the policy of ourParty, the policy of waging a fight on two fronts, is a Centrist policy. 
 Lenin always waged a fight on two fronts in our Party—both against the “Lefts” and against outright Menshevik deviations. 
 Study Lenin’s pamphlet, “ Left-Wing ” Communism , an Infantile Disorder , study the history of our Party, and you will realise that our Party grew and gained strength in a struggle against both de-viations—the Right and the “Left. 
” The fight against the Otzovists and the “Left” Communists, on the one hand, and the fight against the openly opportunist de-viation before, during and after the October Revolution, on the other hand—such were the phases that our Party passed through in its development. 
 Everyone is familiarwith the words of Lenin that we must wage a fight both against open opportunists and against “Left” doctrinaires. 
 Does this mean that Lenin was a Centrist, that he pursued a Centrist policy? It obviously does not. 
 That being the case, what do our Right and “Left” deviators represent? As to the Right deviation, it is not, of course, the opportunism of the pre-war Social-Democrats. 
 A de-viation towards opportunism is not yet opportunism. 
We are familiar with the explanation Lenin gave of the concept of deviation. 
 A deviation to the Right is some-thing which has not yet taken the shape of opportunismand which can be corrected. 
 Consequently, a deviation to the Right must not be identified with out-and-out opportunism. 
 As to the “Left” deviation, it is something diamet-rically opposite to what the extreme Lefts in the pre-war Second International, that is, the Bolsheviks,represented. 
 Not only are the “Left” deviators not Lefts without quotation marks, they are essentially Right deviators, with the difference, however, thatthey unconsciously camouflage their true nature by means of “Left” phrases. 
 It would be a crime against the Party not to perceive the vast difference between the “Left” deviators and genuine Leninists, who are the only Lefts (without quotation marks) in our Party. 
 (A voice : “What about the legalisation of deviations?”) If waging an open fight against deviations is legalisa-tion, then it must be confessed that Lenin “legalised”them long ago. 
 These deviators, both Rights and “Lefts,” are recruited from the most diverse elements of the non-proletarian strata, elements who reflect the pressure of the petty-bourgeois elemental forces on the Party and the degeneration of certain sections of the Party. 
Former members of other parties; people in the Party with Trotskyist trends; remnants of former groups in the Party; Party members in the state, economic, co-operative and trade-union apparatuses who are becom-ing (or have become) bureaucratised and are linking themselves with the outright bourgeois elements inthese apparatuses; well-to-do Party members in our rural organisations who are merging with the kulaks, and so on and so forth—such is the nutritive mediumfor deviations from the Leninist line. 
 It is obvious that these elements are incapable of absorbing anything genuinely Left and Leninist. 
 They are only capable ofnourishing the openly opportunist deviation, or the so-called “Left” deviation, which masks its opportunism with Left phrases. 
 That is why a fight on two fronts is the only correct policy for the Party. 
 Further. 
 Are the theses correct in saying that our chief method of fighting the Right deviation should be that of a full-scale ideological struggle? I think they are. 
 It would be well to recall the experience of the fight against Trotskyism. 
 With what did we begin the fight against Trotskyism? Was it, perhaps, with organ-isational penalties? Of course not! We began it with an ideological struggle. 
 We waged it from 1918 to 1925. 
 Already in 1924 our Party and the Fifth Congress of theComintern passed a resolution on Trotskyism defining it as a petty-bourgeois deviation. 
 Nevertheless, Trotsky continued to be a member of our Central Committeeand Political Bureau. 
 Is that a fact, or not? It is a fact. 
 Consequently, we “tolerated” Trotsky and the Trotsky-ists on the Central Committee. 
 Why did we allow themto remain in leading Party bodies? Because at that time the Trotskyists, despite their disagreements with the Party, obeyed the decisions of the Central Committeeand remained loyal. 
 When did we begin to apply or-ganisational penalties at all extensively? Only after the Trotskyists had organised themselves into a faction,set up their factional centre, turned their faction into a new party and began to summon people to anti-Soviet demonstrations. 
 I think that we must pursue the same course in the fight against the Right deviation. 
 The Right deviation cannot as yet be regarded as something which has takendefinite shape and crystallised, although it is gaining ground in the Party. 
 It is only in process of taking shape and crystallising. 
 Do the Right deviators have afaction? I do not think so. 
 Can it be said that they do not submit to the decisions of our Party? I think we have no grounds yet for accusing them of this. 
 Can it be affirmedthat the Right deviators will certainly organise themselves into a faction? I doubt it. 
 Hence the conclu-sion that our chief method of fighting the Right devia-tion at this stage should be that of a full-scale ideological struggle. 
 This is all the more correct as there is an oppo-site tendency among some of the members of our Party— a tendency to begin the fight against the Right deviation not with an ideological struggle, but with organisationalpenalties. 
 They say bluntly: Give us ten or twenty of these Rights and we’ll make mincemeat of them in a trice and so put an end to the Right deviation. 
 I think,comrades, that such sentiments are wrong and dangerous. 
 Precisely in order to avoid being carried away by such sentiments, and in order to put the fight against the Rightdeviation on correct lines, it must be said plainly and resolutely that our chief method of fighting the Right deviation at this stage is an ideological struggle. 
 Does that mean that we rule out all organisational penalties? No, it does not. 
 But it does undoubtedly mean that organisational penalties must play a subordinaterole, and if there are no instances of infringement of Party decisions by Right deviators, we must not expel them from leading organisations or institutions. 
(A voice : “What about the Moscow experience?”) I do not think that there were any Rights among the leading Moscow comrades. 
 There was in Moscow anincorrect attitude towards Right sentiments. 
 More accu-rately, it could be said that there was a conciliatory tendency there. 
 But I cannot say that there was a Rightdeviation in the Moscow Committee. 
 ( A voice : “But was there an organisational struggle?”) There was an organisational struggle, although it played a minor role. 
 There was such a struggle because new elections are being held in Moscow on the basis of self-criticism, and district meetings of actives have the right to replace their secretaries. 
 ( Laughter . 
) (A voice : “Were new elections of our secretaries an-nounced?”) Nobody has forbidden new elections of secretaries. 
 There is the June appeal of the Central Com-mittee, which expressly says that development of self-criticism may become an empty phrase if the lower organisations are not assured the right to replace any secretary, or any committee. 
 What objection can youraise to such an appeal? ( A voice : “Before the Party Con-ference?”) Yes, even before the Party Conference. 
 I see an incredulous smile on the faces of some comrades. 
 That will not do, comrades. 
 I see that some of you have an irrepressible desire to remove certain spokesmen of the Right deviation from their posts as quickly as pos-sible. 
 But that, dear comrades, is no solution of the prob-lem. 
 Of course, it is easier to remove people from their posts than to conduct a broad and intelligent campaignexplaining the Right deviation, the Right danger, and how to combat it. 
 But what is easiest must not be con-sidered the best. 
 Be so good as to organise a broad ex-planatory campaign against the Right danger, be so good as not to grudge the time for it, and then you will see that the broader and deeper the campaign, the worseit will be for the Right deviation. 
 That is why I think that the central point of our fight against the Right de-viation must be an ideological struggle. 
 As to the Moscow Committee, I do not know that anything can be added to what Uglanov said in his reply to the discussion at the plenum of the Moscow Committeeand Moscow Control Commission of the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
). 
 He said plainly: “If we recall a little history, if we recall how I fought Zinoviev in Leningrad in 1921, it will be seen that at that time the ‘affray’ was somewhat fiercer. 
 We werethe victors then because we were in the right. 
 We have been beaten now because we are in the wrong. 
 It will be a good lesson. 
” It follows that Uglanov has been waging a fight now just as at one time he waged a fight against Zinoviev. 
 Against whom, may it be asked, has he been waging hispresent fight? Evidently, against the policy of the C. 
C. 
 Against whom else could he have waged it? On what basis could he have waged this fight? Obviously, on thebasis of conciliation towards the Right deviation. 
 The theses, therefore, quite rightly stress, as one of the immediate tasks of our Party, the necessity of wag-ing a fight against conciliation towards deviations from the Leninist line, especially against conciliation towards the Right deviation. 
 Finally, a last point. 
 The theses say that we must particularly stress the necessity at this time of fighting the Right deviation. 
 What does that mean? It meansthat at this moment the Right danger is the chief danger in our Party. 
 A fight against Trotskyist trends, and a concentrated fight at that, has been going on already forsome ten years. 
 This fight has resulted in the rout of the main Trotskyist cadres. 
 It cannot be said that the fight against the openly opportunist trend has been wagedof late with equal intensity. 
 It has not been waged with special intensity because the Right deviation is still in a period of formation and crystallisation, growing andgaining strength because of the strengthening of the petty-bourgeois elemental forces, which have been fostered by our grain procurement difficulties. 
 The chief blow must therefore be aimed at the Right deviation. 
 In conclusion, I should like, comrades, to mention one more fact, which has not been mentioned here and which, in my opinion, is of no little significance. 
 We, the members of the Political Bureau, have laid beforeyou our theses on the control figures. 
 In my speech, I upheld these theses as unquestionably correct. 
 I do not say that certain corrections may not be made in the the-ses. 
 But that they are in the main correct and assure the proper carrying out of the Leninist line, of that there can be no doubt whatever. 
 Well, I must tell you thatwe in the Political Bureau adopted these theses unani-mously. 
 I think that this fact is of some significance in view of the rumours which are now and again spread inour ranks by diverse ill-wishers, opponents and enemies of our Party. 
 I have in mind the rumours to the effect that in the Political Bureau we have a Right deviation,a “Left” deviation, conciliation and the devil knows what besides. 
 Let these theses serve as one more proof, the hundredth or hundred and first, that we in the Polit-ical Bureau are all united. 
 I should like this plenum to adopt these theses, in principle, with equal unanimity.

 273, November 24, 1928 TO THE WORKERS OF THE “KATUSHKA” FACTORY, TO THE WORKERS OF THE YARTSEVO FACTORY, SMOLENSK GUBERNIA59 I hail your initiative in organising emulation for the exemplary carrying out of the election campaignto the Soviets. 
 Elections to the Soviets—the organs of the dicta-torship of the working class—should be the vital concernof the workers themselves. 
 Your participation in the election campaign should not be confined to carrying out in proper, Bolshevikfashion the elections in your own town, the elections to the town Soviets. 
 A more difficult, but no less necessary, task is to take a direct part in the election campaign in the coun-tryside. 
 The outcome of the Soviet elections will large-ly depend on the extent to which the working class inthe towns and the agricultural labourers and poor peas-ants in the countryside take part in the campaign, exert their influence on its progress, take the lead of themiddle peasants, force the kulaks into the background, and thus assure the leadership of the working class in the countryside. 
 Therefore, the interchange of challenges to emulation that you have initiated in the press will be of great significance in rousing the workers for a wideparticipation in the election campaign. 
 I wish you success.

 286 December 9, 1928 THE RIGHT DANGER IN THE GERMAN COMMUNIST PARTY Speech Delivered at the Meeting of the Presidium of the E. 
C. 
C. 
I. 
 December 19, 1928 Comrades, since Comrade Molotov has already stated here the views of the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) delegation, I haveonly to say a few words. 
 I intend to touch upon three questions which came up in the course of the discussion, and that only lightly. 
 These questions are: the problem of the capitalist stabilisation, the problem of the class battles of the proletariat in connection with the growing shakiness ofthe stabilisation, and the problem of the German Com-munist Party. 
 I have to note with regret that on all these three questions both Humbert-Droz and Serra landed in the quagmire of craven opportunism. 
 Humbert-Droz, it is true, has so far spoken only on formal questions. 
 ButI am referring to his speech on matters of principle at the meeting of the Political Secretariat of the E. 
C. 
C. 
I. 
, where the question of the Rights and the conciliators inthe German Communist Party was discussed. 
 I think that it is precisely this speech that forms the ideological basis of the position taken up at this meeting by theminority in the E. 
C. 
C. 
I. 
 Presidium. 
 Consequently, Hum-bert-Droz’s speech on matters of principle at the meeting of the Political Secretariat of the E. 
C. 
C. 
I. 
 cannot be passed over in silence. 
 I said that Humbert-Droz and Serra have landed in the quagmire of craven opportunism. 
 What does that mean? It means that, besides overt opportunism, there is also covert opportunism, which fears to show itstrue face. 
 And this is precisely the opportunism of conciliation towards the Right deviation. 
 Conciliation is craven opportunism. 
 I must, I repeat, note with regretthat both these comrades have landed in the quagmire of craven opportunism. 
 Permit me to demonstrate this by a few facts. 
 I THE PROBLEM OF THE CAPITALIST STABILISATION The Comintern holds that the present capitalist stabilisation is a temporary, insecure, shaky and decay-ing stabilisation which will become more and more shakenas the capitalist crisis develops. 
 This by no means contradicts the generally known fact that capitalist technology and rationalisation areadvancing. 
 More, it is just because they are advancing that the inherent unsoundness and decay of the stab-ilisation is developing. 
 Yet what did Humbert-Droz say in his speech in the Political Secretariat of the E. 
C. 
C. 
I. 
? He flatly denied the shakiness and insecurity of the stabilisation. 
 Hebluntly declared in his speech that “the Sixth World Congress virtually condemned the vague general for-mula that the stabilisation is unsound, shaky, etc. 
” He bluntly declared that the Sixth Congress thesis on the third period says nothing about the stabilisation being shaky. 
 Can it be considered that Humbert-Droz is cor-rect in making this assertion? No, it cannot. 
 It cannot, because the Sixth Congress of the Comintern said the very opposite of what Humbert-Droz claimed in his speech. 
 In the paragraph on the third period, the Sixth Congress of the Comintern plainly states that: “this period (i. 
e. 
, the third period— J. 
 St. 
 ) inevitably leads, through the further development of the contradictions of thecapitalist stabilisation, to a further shaking * of the capitalist stabilisation and to a sharp accentuation of the general crisis of capitalism. 
” 60 Mark, “a further shaking of the stabilisation. 
”. 
 . 
 . 
 What does that mean? It means that the stabilisa-tion is already shaky and insecure, and that in the third period it will become further shaken. 
 Yet Humbert-Droz permits himself to scoff at all, including the Ger-man Communist Party, who say that the stabilisation is shaky and decaying, who say that the present struggleof the working class is undermining and disintegrating the capitalist stabilisation. 
 Whom is Humbert-Droz scoffing at? Obviously, at the decisions of the SixthCongress. 
 It follows that, under the guise of upholding the decisions of the Sixth Congress of the Comintern, Hum-bert-Droz is actually revising them, and is thereby slid-ing into an opportunist conception of the stabilisation. 
 So much for the formal side of the matter. 
 * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 Let us now examine the substance of the matter. 
 If it cannot be said that the present stabilisation is shaky, or unsound, or insecure, then, after all, what is it? Onlyone thing remains, and that is to declare that the stab-ilisation is secure, and at any rate is growing firmer. 
 But if we are faced by a capitalist stabilisation that isgrowing firmer, what can be meant by saying that the crisis of world capitalism is growing sharper and deeper? Is it not clear that this leaves no room for any deepeningof the capitalist crisis? Is it not clear that Humbert-Droz has become entangled in his own contradictions? Further. 
 Lenin said that, under imperialism, the development of capitalism is a double process: a growth of capitalism in some countries, on the one hand, and a decay of capitalism in other countries, on the other hand. 
 Is this thesis of Lenin’s correct? And if it is correct, is it not clear that the capitalist stabilisation cannot be other than decaying? Lastly, a few words about some generally known facts. 
 We have such facts as the desperate conflicts between imperialist groups for markets and fields of capitalexport. 
 We have such facts as the frenzied growth of arma-ments in the capitalist countries, the formation of newmilitary alliances and the manifest preparations for new imperialist wars. 
 We have such facts as the growing acuteness of the contradictions between the two imperialist giants, Amer-ica and Britain, each of which is trying to draw all other countries into its orbit. 
 We have, lastly, such facts as the existence of the Soviet Union and its progress and success in all fields of development, in the economic field and in the cul-tural and political field—the Soviet Union, whose exist-ence alone, not to speak of its progress, is shaking anddisintegrating the very foundations of world capitalism. 
 How, after this, can Marxists, Leninists, Communists assert that the capitalist stabilisation is not shaky anddecaying, that it is not being shaken by the very course of things from year to year and from day to day? Does Humbert-Droz, and Serra with him, realise into what a quagmire they are landing? From this error spring the other errors of Humbert-Droz and Serra. 
 II THE PROBLEM OF THE CLASS BATTLES OF THE PROLETARIAT Just as erroneous is Humbert-Droz’s opinion of the class battles of the proletariat in the capitalist coun-tries, of their character and significance. 
 It follows from Humbert-Droz’s speech at the meeting of the PoliticalSecretariat that the struggle of the working class, its spontaneous clashes with the capitalists, are in the main only of a defensive character, and that the leadershipof this struggle on the part of the Communist Parties should be carried out only within the framework of the existing reformist trade unions. 
 Is that right? No, it is wrong. 
 To assert that means to drag in the wake of events. 
 Humbert-Droz forgets that the struggle of the working class is now takingplace on the basis of a stabilisation that is becoming shaken , that the battles of the working class not infrequently bear the character of counter-battles, of a counter-offensive and a direct offensive against the capitalists. 
 Humbert-Droz fails to see anything newin the battles of the working class in the recent period. 
 He fails to see such things as the Lodz general strike, the economic strikes for better conditions of labour inFrance, Czechoslovakia and Germany, the mighty mobi-lisation of the proletarian forces in Germany in the fights against the lock-out of the metalworkers, and so on andso forth. 
 What do these and similar facts show, what do they indicate? That deep within the capitalist countries thepre-conditions for a new revolutionary upsurge of the working-class movement are ripening. 
 And that is the new element which Humbert-Droz and Serra fail to see,fail to observe, and which never will be observed at all by comrades who have become accustomed to looking backward instead of forward. 
 And what does looking backward instead of forward mean? It means dragging in the wake of events, failing to see what is new in developments, and being caughtby surprise. 
 It means renouncing the leading role of the Communist Parties in the working-class movement. 
 That was precisely what caused the German CommunistParty leadership to come to grief in the 1923 revolu-tion. 
 Consequently, he who does not want to repeat the mistakes of 1923 must rouse the minds of the Commu-nists and urge them onward, must prepare the masses for the coming battles, must take every measure to en-sure that the Communist Parties are not left behind inthe wake of events and that the working class is not caught by surprise. 
 It is extremely strange that Humbert-Droz and Serra forget these things. 
 At the time of the Ruhr battles the German Commu-nists noted the fact that the unorganised workers proved to be more revolutionary than the organised workers. 
 Humbert-Droz is outraged by this and declares that itcould not have been so. 
 Strange! Why could it not have been so? There are about a million workers in the Ruhr. 
 Of them, about two hundred thousand are organisedin trade unions. 
 The trade unions are directed by re-formist bureaucrats who are connected in all manner of ways with the capitalist class. 
 Why is it surprising,then, that the unorganised workers proved to be more revolutionary than the organised? Could it indeed have been otherwise? I might tell you of even more “surprising” facts from the history of the revolutionary movement in Rus-sia. 
 With us, it happened not infrequently that the massesproved to be more revolutionary than (some of) their communist leaders. 
 That is well known to all the Rus-sian Bolsheviks. 
 It was this that Lenin had in mindwhen he said that we must not only teach the masses, but also learn from the masses . 
 What is surprising is not these facts, but that Humbert-Droz does not under-stand such simple things taken from the sphere of prac-tical revolutionary experience. 
 The same must be said of Serra. 
 He does not ap-prove of the fact that the German Communists, in their struggle to organise the locked-out metalworkers, went beyond the framework of the existing trade unionsand shook this framework. 
 He regards this as an infringe-ment of the resolutions of the Fourth Congress of the Profintern. 
61 He claims that the Profintern called upon Communists to work only within the trade unions. 
 That is nonsense, comrades! The Profintern did not call foranything of the kind. 
 To say that is to condemn the Com-munist Party to the role of a passive observer of the class battles of the proletariat. 
 To say that is to bury the ideaof the leading role of the Communist Party in the work-ing-class movement. 
 The merit of the German Communists is precisely that they did not allow themselves to be scared by talk about “the framework of the trade unions” and went beyond this framework by organising the struggle ofthe non-organised workers against the will of the trade-union bureaucrats. 
 The merit of the German Communists is precisely that they sought for and found new formsof struggle and organisation of the unorganised workers. 
 It is possible that in doing so they committed a number of trifling errors. 
 But no new undertaking is ever freefrom errors. 
 From the fact that we must work within the reformist trade unions—provided only that they are mass organisations—it does not at all follow that wemust confine our mass work to work within the reform-ist trade unions, that we must become slaves of the standards and demands of those unions. 
 If the re-formist leadership is identifying itself with capitalism (see the resolutions of the Sixth Congress of the Comin-tern and the Fourth Congress of the Profintern), whilethe working class is waging a struggle against capital-ism, can it be affirmed that the struggle of the working class, led by the Communist Party, can avoid breakingto some extent the existing reformist framework of the trade unions? Obviously, this cannot be affirmed without landing into opportunism. 
 Therefore, a situa-tion is quite conceivable in which it may be neces-sary to create parallel mass associations of the workingclass, against the will of the trade-union bosses who have sold themselves to the capitalists. 
 We already have such a situation in America. 
 It is quite possible thatthings are moving in the same direction in Germany too. 
 III THE PROBLEM OF THE GERMAN COMMUNIST PARTY Is the German Communist Party to be or not to be organised and united, with an iron internal discipline?— that is the question, comrades. 
 It is a question not only of the Rights or of the conciliators, but of the very exist-ence of the German Communist Party. 
 There is a Ger-man Communist Party. 
 But alongside and within the German Communist Party there are two forces whichare disintegrating the Party from within and creating a threat to its existence. 
 They are, firstly, the Right fac-tion, who are organising within the Communist Party anew, anti-Leninist party, with its own centre and its own press organs, and who day after day are violating its discipline. 
 They are, secondly, a group of conciliatorswhose vacillations are strengthening the Right faction. 
 I shall not stop to show that the Right faction is breaking with Marxism-Leninism and waging a desper-ate struggle against the Comintern. 
 That was shown long ago. 
 Nor shall I stop to show that the group of conciliators are violating the Sixth Congress resolutionon waging a systematic fight against the Rights. 
 That, too, was shown long ago. 
 The point now is that this situation in the German Communist Party can-not be tolerated any longer. 
 The point is that to tol-erate any longer an “order” of things in which the Rights poison the atmosphere with Social-Democraticideological rubbish and systematically violate the ele-mentary principles of Party discipline, while the concili-ators bring grist to the mill of the Rights, would be to go against the Comintern and to violate the elemen-tary demands of Marxism-Leninism. 
 A situation has arisen similar to (if not worse than) the one which existed in the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) in the lastphase of the struggle against Trotskyism, when the Par-ty and the Comintern were obliged to expel the Trotsky-ists from their ranks. 
 Everybody sees that now. 
 ButHumbert-Droz and Serra do not see it, or pretend not to see it. 
 That means that they are prepared to support both the Rights and the conciliators, even at the costof the complete disintegration of the German Commu-nist Party. 
 In opposing the expulsion of the Rights, Humbert-Droz and Serra refer to the resolution of the Sixth Congress which says that Right deviations must be overcome by means of an ideological struggle. 
 That isperfectly true. 
 But these comrades forget that the reso-lutions of the Sixth Congress by no means limit the strug-gle of the Communist Parties against the Right dangerto measures of an ideological order. 
 While speaking of methods of ideological struggle against deviations from the Leninist line, the Sixth Congress of the Comintern,in its resolution on Bukharin’s report, at the same time declared that: “far from precluding, this presumes the utmost strengthening of iron inner-Party discipline , unqualified subordination of the minority to the majority, unqualified subordination of the lower bodies , as well as of other Party organisations (groups in parlia-ment, groups in trade unions, the press, etc. 
) to the leading Party centres . 
”*62 It is extremely strange that Humbert-Droz and Serra forget this thesis of the resolution of the SixthCongress of the Comintern. 
 It is extremely strange that all conciliators, both those who consider themselves conciliators and those who repudiate the name, whenpleading the Sixth Congress resolution systematically forget this important thesis of the Communist Interna-tional. 
 What is to be done if, instead of the utmost strength-ening of iron inner-Party discipline, we have in the German Communist Party glaring instances of themost unceremonious violation of all discipline both by the Rights and, to some extent, by some of the concil-iators? Can such a situation be tolerated any longer? What is to be done if, instead of unqualified subor-dination of the lower bodies, groups in trade unions and certain organs of the Party press to the leading Partycentre, we have in the German Communist Party glar-ing instances of the grossest violation of this demand of the Sixth Congress of the Comintern by the Rightsand, to a certain extent, by some of the conciliators? Can such a situation be tolerated any longer? You are familiar with the conditions for admission to the Comintern endorsed by the Second Congress. 
 63 I am referring to the twenty-one points. 
 The first point * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 of these conditions says that “the periodical and non-periodical press and all Party publishing houses must be completely subordinated to the Central Committee of the Party ,* irrespective of whether at the given moment the Party as a whole is legal or illegal. 
” You know that the Right faction have two press organs at their disposal. 
You know that those press organs refuse even to hear of any subordination to the Central Committee of the German Communist Party. 
 The question arises, can sucha scandalous state of affairs be tolerated any longer? The 12th point of the twenty-one conditions says that the Party must be “organised on the most central-ised lines,” that within it must “ prevail iron discipline bordering upon military discipline . 
”* You know that the Rights in the German Communist Party refuse to recogniseiron discipline, or any discipline whatever, except their own, factional discipline. 
 The question arises, can this scandalous state of affairs be tolerated any longer? Or perhaps you will say that the conditions en-dorsed by the Second Congress of the Comintern are not binding on the Rights? Humbert-Droz and Serra raise an outcry here about imaginary violators of decisions of the Communist In-ternational. 
 At the present time, in the shape of theRights we have real (not imaginary) violators of the fundamental principles of the Communist Internation-al. 
 Why, then, do they keep silent? Is it not becausethey want, under the guise of a verbal defence of Comin-tern decisions, to smuggle through a defence of the Rights and a revision of these decisions? * My italics. 
— J. 
 St. 
 Particularly interesting is Serra’s statement. 
 He vows and swears that he is against the Rights, against he conciliators, and so forth. 
 But what conclusion doeshe draw from this? Is it, do you think, the necessity of fighting the Rights and the conciliators? Nothing of the kind! He draws from this the extremely strange con-clusion that it is necessary, in his opinion, to reorganise the existing Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party. 
 Just think! The Political Bureau of the C. 
C. 
 of the German Communist Party is waging a determined struggle against the Right danger and against the vacillations ofthe conciliators; Serra is in favour of a fight against the Rights and the conciliators; therefore , Serra proposes that the Rights and the conciliators should be left alone, thatthe fight against the Rights and the conciliators should be relaxed, and that the composition of the Political Bureau of the C. 
C. 
 of the German Communist Partyshould be altered in a conciliatory direction. 
 What a “conclusion”! Serra will pardon me if I say here without mincing words that his position on this question is reminiscent of that of a provincial pettifogger who tries to make out that white is black, and black white. 
 It is what we calla pettifogging defence of opportunist elements. 
 Serra proposes that the Political Bureau of the C. 
C. 
 of the German Communist Party should be reorganised,that is, that some members should be removed from it and others put in, that they should he replaced by oth-ers. 
 Why does not Serra say bluntly and frankly—re-placed by whom? ( Serra : “By those whom the Sixth Congress of the Comintern wanted. 
”) But the Sixth Con-gress certainly did not suggest rehabilitating concilia-tors. 
 On the contrary, it charged us with waging a systematic fight against conciliation. 
 And preciselybecause this obligation has not been carried out by the conciliators, we have now, after the Sixth Congress, the decision of the E. 
C. 
C. 
I. 
 Presidium of October 6,1928, on the Rights and the conciliators. 
 Serra wants to assume the role of sole interpreter of the decisions of the Sixth Congress. 
 That claim of Serra’s is entirelyunwarranted. 
 The interpreter of the decisions of the Sixth Congress is the Executive Committee of the Comintern and its Presidium. 
 I see that Serra does not agree withthe decision of the E. 
C. 
C. 
I. 
 Presidium of October 6, although he has not said so plainly. 
 What is the conclusion? There is only one conclu-sion: the position of Humbert-Droz and Serra on the question of the German Communist Party is one of craven, pettifogging defence of the Rights against theGerman Communist Party and the Comintern.

That is clear, one would think.

C.

P. 
G. 
, or as an argument in favour of the conciliators in Germany , who have not yet broken, and are apparently unwilling to break, with the Right faction ? I think that nothing more stupid than such a plea can be imagined. 
 Only people whohave abandoned all logic can fail to understand the vast difference between the position of the Rights in the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) and the position of the Rights in theC. 
P. 
G. 
 In point of fact, the Rights in the C.

C.

S. 
U.

 The Rights in Germany, on the con-trary, already have a faction, headed by a factional cen-tre, and systematically trample underfoot decisions of the C.

 Is it not obvious that at this moment /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR the methods of fighting the Rights cannot be the same in these two parties? Further. 
 Here in the U.

 Social-Democracy does not exist as an organised and serious force capable of fostering and stimulating the Right danger in the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
). 
 In Germany, on the contrary, there isalongside the Communist Party the stronger and fairly firmly organised Social-Democratic Party, which fos-ters the Right deviation in the German Communist Par-ty and objectively converts this deviation into its agen-cy. 
 Is it not obvious that one must be blind not to per-ceive the vast difference between the situations in theU. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 and in Germany? Lastly, there is one other circumstance. 
 Our Party grew and gained strength in fierce battles againstthe Mensheviks; moreover, for a number of years those battles took the form of direct civil war against them. 
 Do not forget that in the October Revolution weBolsheviks overthrew the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, as being the Left wing of the counter-revolutionary imperialist bourgeoisie. 
 This, incidently,explains why nowhere, in no other Communist Party in the world, is the tradition of struggle against open opportunism so strong as it is in the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
). 
 Wehave only to recall the Moscow organisation, especially the Moscow Committee, where there were instances of conciliatory vacillation; we have only to recall how theworking-class Party members in Moscow at a single stroke straightened out the line of the Moscow Commit-tee in a couple of months—we have only to recall allthis to realise how strong in our Party is the tradition of struggle against open opportunism. 
 Call the same thing be said of the German Commu-nist Party? You will no doubt agree with me that, unfor-tunate]y, it cannot. 
 More than that, we cannot denythat the Communist Party in Germany is still far from having rid itself of Social-Democratic traditions, which foster the Right danger in the C. 
P.

 There you have the conditions in Germany and the conditions in the U.

 V THE DRAFTS FOR THE OPEN AND CLOSED LETTERS A couple of words regarding the draft resolutions submitted by the E. 
C.

 commissions. 
 Serra considers that these drafts bear the character of provincial reso-lutions. 
 Why, one asks? Because, it appears, the draft of the open letter does not contain an analysis of the political situation which engenders the Right danger. 
 That is ridiculous, comrades. 
 We have such an anal-ysis in the decisions of the Sixth Congress. 
 Is there any need to repeat it? I think that it should not be repeated. 
As a matter of fact, we might have confined ourselves to a brief resolution on the Rights, who systematically violate the decisions of the Sixth Congress and are there-fore liable to expulsion, and on the conciliators, who are not waging a fight against the Rights and therefore deserve to be given a most serious warning. 
 If, however, we did not confine ourselves to a brief resolution, it was in order to explain to the workers the nature of the Right deviation, to show them the trueface of the Brandlers and Thalheimers, to show them what they were in the past and what they are now, to show how long the Comintern has spared them in the hopeof correcting them, how long the Communists have tol-erated them in their midst, and why the presence of such people in the Comintern cannot be tolerated anylonger. 
 That is why the draft resolution is longer than might have been expected at first glance. 
 Comrade Molotov has already said here that the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B.

 I can only repeat Comrade Molotov’sstatement. 
 Bolshevik , No. 
 23-24, 1928 REPLY TO KUSHTYSEV Comrade Kushtysev, I have received your letter of December 11, 1928. 
Your question might at first sight appear to be cor-rect. 
 Actually, it will not stand the slightest criticism. 
 It should be easy to understand that when Lenin saysthat “Soviet power plus electrification is communism,” he does not mean by this that there will be any kind of po-litical power under communism, nor does he mean thatif we have seriously set about electrifying the country we have thereby already achieved communism. 
 What did Lenin mean to say when making this statement? In my opinion, all he meant to say was that Soviet power alone is not enough for the advance to-wards communism, that in order to advance towardscommunism the Soviet power must electrify the country and transfer the entire national economy to large-scale production , and that the Soviet power is prepared to take this course in order to arrive at communism. 
 Lenin’s dictum implies nothing more than the readi-ness of the Soviet power to advance towards communism through electrification. 
 We often say that our republic is a socialist one. 
 Does this mean that we have already achieved socialism,done away with classes and abolished the state (for the achievement of socialism implies the withering away of the state)? Or does it mean that classes, the state, and so on, will still exist under socialism? Obviouslynot. 
 Are we entitled in that case to call our republic a socialist one? Of course, we are. 
 From what stand-point? From the standpoint of our determination and our readiness to achieve socialism, to do away with classes, etc. 
 Perhaps, Comrade Kushtysev, you would agree to listen to Lenin’s opinion on this point? If so, then listen: “No one, I think, in considering the question of the economy of Russia has ever denied its transitional character. 
 Nor, I think has any Communist denied that the term Socialist Soviet Republic signifies the determination of the Soviet power to achieve the transition to socialism, and not at all that the new economic order is a socialist order” (V ol. 
 XXII, p. 
 513). 
 Clear, I think. 
 With communist greetings, J. 
 Stalin December 28, 1928 Published for the first time THEY HAVE SUNK TO NEW DEPTHS The necessity of raising with the utmost sharpness the question of the Trotskyist underground organisa-tion is dictated by all its recent activities, whichcompel the Party and the Soviet Government to adopt an attitude towards the Trotskyists fundamentally dif-ferent from that of the Party towards them before the Fifteenth Congress. 
 The open demonstration of the Trotskyists in the streets on November 7, 1927, was a turning-point, whenthe Trotskyist organisation showed that it was breaking not only with the Party, but also with the Soviet regime. 
 This demonstration was preceded by a whole series of anti-Party and anti-Soviet acts: the forcible seizure of a government building for a meeting (the MoscowHigher Technical School), the organisation of under-ground printing plants, etc. 
 However, prior to the Fif-teenth Congress the Party still adopted measures withregard to the Trotskyist organisation testifying to the desire of the Party leadership to induce the Trotskyists to mend their ways, to induce them to admit their er-rors, to induce them to return to the Party path. 
 For a number of years, beginning with the 1923 discussion, the Party patiently pursued this line—the line, chiefly,of an ideological struggle . 
 And even at the Fifteenth Party Congress it was precisely such measures against the Trotskyist organisation that were considered, notwith-standing the fact that the Trotskyists had “passed from disagreements over tactics to disagreements of a program-matic character, revising the views of Lenin and sinking to the position of Menshevism. 
” (Resolution of the Fif-teenth Congress. 
)65 The year that has elapsed since the Fifteenth Con-gress has shown that the Fifteenth Congress was right in deciding to expel active Trotskyists from the Party. 
In the course of 1928 the Trotskyists completed their con-version from an underground anti-Party group into an underground anti-Soviet organisation . 
 This was the new element which during 1928 compelled the Soviet author-ities to adopt repressive measures against active mem-bers of this underground anti-Soviet organisation. 
 The organs of authority of the proletarian dictator-ship cannot permit that in the land of the dictatorship of the proletariat there should exist an underground anti-Soviet organisation which, although insignificant in membership, nevertheless has its printing plants and its committees, which is attempting to organise anti-Soviet strikes, and which is going to the length of pre-paring its followers for civil war against the organs of the proletarian dictatorship. 
 But it is precisely tosuch depths that the Trotskyists have sunk—once a faction within the Party, they have now become an un-derground anti-Soviet organisation. 
 Naturally, all the anti-Soviet, Menshevik elements in the country are expressing their sympathy with the Trotskyists and are now grouping around them. 
 The struggle of the Trotskyists against the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) had its own logic, and this logic has brought them into the anti-Soviet camp. 
 Trotsky began by advising his followers in January 1928 to strike at the leadership of the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
), without settingthemselves up against the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 However, the logic of the struggle brought Trotsky to a point at which his blows against the leadership of the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
), againstthe guiding force of the proletarian dictatorship, were inevitably directed against the dictatorship of the proletariat itself, against the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
, against ourentire Soviet society. 
 The Trotskyists have tried in every way to dis-credit the Party, which directs the country, and theorgans of Soviet Government in the eyes of the working class. 
 In his letter of instructions of October 21, 1928, which he sent abroad and which was published notonly in the organ of the renegade Maslow, but also in whiteguard organs ( Rul, 66 etc. 
), Trotsky makes the slan-derous anti-Soviet allegation that the system existingin the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 is “Kerenskyism turned inside-out,” calls for the organisation of strikes and the disruption of the collective agreement campaign, and in fact pre-pares his cadres for the possibility of another civil war. 
 Other Trotskyists say bluntly that in preparing for civil war “we must stop at nothing and not be deterredby any rules, written or unwritten. 
” The slanders against the Red Army and its leaders which the Trotskyists disseminate in the undergroundand foreign renegade press and, through it, in the white-guard press abroad, show that the Trotskyists do not stop at directly inciting the international bourgeoisieagainst the Soviet state. 
 The Red Army and its leaders are depicted in these documents as the army of a future Bonapartist coup. 
 Moreover, the Trotskyist organisation is trying, on the one hand, to split the Comintern sec-tions, to disintegrate the ranks of the Comintern bycreating its factions everywhere, and, on the other hand, is inciting against the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 the elements who as it is are hostile to the Soviet state. 
 The revolutionary phrases in the writings of the Trotskyists can no longer conceal the counter-revolu-tionary essence of the Trotskyist appeals. 
 At the TenthParty Congress, in connection with the Kronstadt mu-tiny, Lenin warned the Party that even “the whiteguards strive, and are able, to disguise themselves as Commu-nists, and even as ‘more Left’ than the Communists, solely in order to weaken and overthrow the bulwark of the proletarian revolution in Russia. 
” Lenin at that timecited as an example the way in which the Mensheviks utilised the disagreements within the R. 
C. 
P. 
(B. 
) in order actually to egg on and support the Kronstadt mutineers,the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the whiteguards, while pretending, in case the mutiny failed, to be supporters of the Soviet regime with only slight amendments. 
 67 The Trotskyist underground organisation has given full proof that it is the sort of camouflaged organisation that at the present time rallies around it all the elementshostile to the proletarian dictatorship. 
 The Trotskyist organisation is in fact now fulfilling the same role as the Menshevik party once fulfilled in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
 inits struggle against the Soviet regime. 
 The subversive activities of the Trotskyist organi-sation demand that the Soviet authorities wage an im-placable fight against this anti-Soviet organisation. 
 This explains the measures taken recently by the OGPU to liquidate this anti-Soviet organisation (arrests and deportations). 
 Apparently, by no means all Party members clearly realise that between the former Trotskyist Opposition within the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) and the present Trotskyist anti-Soviet underground organisation outside theC. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) there is already an impassable gulf . 
 Yet it is high time to understand and appreciate this obvious truth. 
 Hence the “liberal” attitude that certain Partymembers sometimes display towards active figures in the Trotskyist underground organisation is absolutely impermissible. 
 All Party members must appreciate this. 
More, it must be explained to the whole country, to the broad strata of the workers and peasants, that the illegal Trotskyist organisation is an anti-Soviet organisation,an organisation hostile to the proletarian dictatorship. 
 Let those Trotskyists who have not yet fully com-mitted themselves also ponder over this new situationcreated by their leaders and by the activities of the Trotskyist underground anti-Soviet organisation. 
 One or the other: either with the Trotskyist under-ground anti-Soviet organisation against the C. 
P. 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) and against the proletarian dictatorship in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
, or complete rupture with the Trotskyist anti-Sovietunderground organisation and withdrawal of any kind of support of this organisation. 
 Published for the first time BUKHARIN’S GROUP AND THE RIGHT DEVIATION IN OUR PARTY From Speeches Delivered at a Joint Meeting of the Political Bureau of the C. 
C. 
 and the Presidium of the C. 
C. 
C. 
, C. 
P . 
S. 
U. 
(B. 
) at the End of January and the Beginning of February 1929 (Brief Record ) Comrades, sad though it is, we have to record the fact that within our Party a separate Bukharin grouphas been formed, consisting of Bukharin, Tomsky and Rykov. 
 The Party knew nothing of the existence of this group before—the Bukharinites carefully concealedits existence from the Party. 
 But now the fact is known and evident. 
 This group, as is seen from their statement, has its own separate platform, which it counterposes to the Party’s policy. 
 It demands, firstly—in opposition to the existing policy of the Party—a slower rate ofdevelopment of our industry, asserting that the present rate of industrial development is “fatal. 
” It demands, secondly—also in opposition to the policy of the Party—curtailment of the formation of state farms and collec-tive farms, asserting that they do not and cannot play any serious part in the development of our agriculture. 
It demands, thirdly—also in opposition to the policy of the Party—the granting of full freedom to private trade and renunciation of the regulating function ofthe state in the sphere of trade, asserting that the regu-lating function of the state renders the development of trade impossible. 
 In other words, Bukharin’s group is a group of Right deviators and capitulators who advocate not the elimination, but the free development of the capitalist elements in town and country. 
 At the same time, Bukharin’s group opposes the emergency measures against the kulaks and “excessive” taxation of the kulaks, and unceremoniously levelsagainst the Party the accusation that, in applying such measures, it is in point of fact conducting a policy of “military and feudal exploitation of the peasantry. 
”Bukharin needed this ludicrous accusation in order to take the kulaks under his protection, and in doing so he confused and lumped together the labouring peasantsand the kulaks. 
 Bukharin’s group demands that the Party radi-cally change its policy along the lines of the group’splatform. 
 They declare further that if the Party’s policy is not changed, Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky will resign. 
 Such are the facts which have been established in the course of the discussion at this joint meeting of the Political Bureau of the C. 
C. 
 and the Presidium of theC. 
C. 
C. 
 It has been established, furthermore, that on the instructions of this group, Bukharin conducted secretnegotiations with Kamenev with a view to forming a bloc of the Bukharinites and the Trotskyists against the Party and its Central Committee. 
 Evidently, havingno hope that their platform would carry the day in the Central Committee of our Party, the Bukharinites thought it necessary to form such a bloc behind the back of the Party’s Central Committee. 
 Were there disagreements between us before? There were. 
 The first outbreak occurred prior to the July ple-num of the C. 
C. 
 (1928). 
 The disagreements concerned these same questions: the rate of industrial development,the state farms and collective farms, full freedom for private trade, emergency measures against the kulaks. 
 At the plenum, however, the matter ended with the adop-tion of a united and common resolution on all these questions. 
 We all believed at that time that Bukharin and his followers had renounced their errors, and thatthe disagreements had been resolved by the adoption of a common resolution. 
 This was the basis which gave rise to the statement on the unity of the Political Bu-reau and the absence of disagreements within it, which was signed by all the members of the Political Bureau (July 1928). 
 A second outbreak of disagreements among us oc-curred prior to the November plenum of the (C. 
C. 
 Bukha-rin’s article, “Notes of an Economist,” clearly indicatedthat all was not well in the Political Bureau, that one of the members of the Political Bureau at any rate was trying to revise or “correct” the C. 
C. 
’s line. 
 At anyrate we, the majority of the members of the Political Bureau, had no doubt that the “Notes of an Economist” was an eclectic anti-Party article, designed to slow downthe rate of industrial development and to change our policy in the countryside along the lines of Frumkin’s well-known letter. 
 To this must be added the ques-tion of the resignation of Rykov, Bukharin and Tomsky. 
 The fact is that at that time Rykov, Bukharin and Tom-sky came to the commission which was drafting the res-olution on the control figures and declared that they were resigning. 
 However, in the course of the work ofthe commission on the control figures all disagreements were smoothed over in one way or another: the present rate of industrial development was preserved, the fur-ther development of state farms and collective farms was approved, maximum taxation of the kulaks was preserved, the regulating function of the state in the sphere of tradewas also preserved, the ludicrous accusation that the Party was conducting a policy of “military and feudal exploitation of the peasantry” was repudiated amidthe general laughter of the members of the commis-sion, and the three withdrew their resignation. 
 As a result, we had a common resolution on the controlfigures adopted by all the members of the Political Bureau. 
 As a result, we had the Political Bureau’s decision to the effect that all its members shoulddeclare both at the November plenum of the C. 
C. 
 and outside it that the Political Bureau was united and that there were no disagreements within the PoliticalBureau. 
 Could we have known at that time that Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky were voting for the joint resolutiononly for appearance’s sake, that they were keeping their specific points of difference with the Party to them-selves, that Bukharin and Tomsky would in realitypractise what amounted to a refusal to work in the A. 
U. 
C. 
C. 
T. 
U. 
, in the Comintern and on Pravda , that Ka-menev had among his private papers a certain “memo-randum” which makes it clear that we have within the C. 
C. 
 a separate group with its own platform, a group which is trying to form a bloc with the Trotskyists against the Party? Obviously, we could not have known that. 
It is now clear to all that disagreements exist and that they are serious. 
 Bukharin is apparently envious of the laurels of Frumkin. 
 Lenin was a thousand timesright when he said in a letter to Shlyapnikov as far back as 1916 that Bukharin was “devilishly unstable in pol-itics. 
” 68 Now this instability has been communicated by Bukharin to the members of his group. 
 The principal misfortune of the Bukharinites is that they have a faith, a conviction that making thingseasier for the kulak and untying his hands is the way to solve our grain and all other difficulties. 
 They think that if we make things easier for the kulak, if we do notrestrict his exploiting tendencies, if we let him have his own way, and so on, the difficulties will disappear and the political state of the country will improve. 
 It goeswithout saying that this naïve faith of the Bukharinites in the saving power of the kulak is such ludicrous non-sense as not even to be worth criticising. 
 The Bukharin-ites’ misfortune is that they do not understand the me-chanics of the class struggle, do not understand that the kulak is an inveterate enemy of the working people,an inveterate enemy of our whole system. 
 They do not understand that a policy of making things easier for the kulak and untying his hands would worsen the en-tire political state of the country, improve the chances of the capitalist elements in the country, lose us the poor peasants, demoralise the middle peasants, and bringabout a rupture with the working class of our country. 
 They do not understand that no untying of the hands of the kulak is capable of easing our grain difficulties in any way, for the kulak will not voluntarily give us grain anyhow so long as there exists the policy of procurementprices and state regulation of the grain market—and we cannot abandon the policy of state regulation of trade if we do not want to undermine the Soviet system, thedictatorship of the proletariat. 
 The Bukharinites’ mis-fortune is that they do not understand these simple and elementary things That is apart from the fact that thepolicy of untying the hands of the capitalist elements is absolutely incompatible, theoretically and politi-cally, with the principles of Lenin’s policy and ofLeninism. 
 That is all very well, comrades may say, but what is the way out, what must be done in connection withthe appearance on the scene of Bukharin’s group? As to the way out of the situation, the majority of the comrades have already expressed their opinion. 
 Themajority of the comrades demand that this meeting should be firm and categorically reject Bukharin’s and Tomsky’s resignation (Rykov has already withdrawnhis). 
 The majority of the comrades demand that this joint meeting of the Political Bureau of the C. 
C. 
 and Presidium of the C. 
C. 
C. 
 should condemn the Right-opportunist, capitulatory platform of Bukharin, Tom-sky and Rykov, that it should condemn the attempt of Bukharin and his group to form an anti-Partybloc with the Trotskyists. 
 I fully subscribe to these- proposals. 
 The Bukharinites disagree with this decision. 
 They would like to be allowed freedom of factional group-ing—in defiance of the Party Rules. 
 They would like to be allowed freedom to violate decisions of the Party and the C. 
C. 
—in defiance of the vital interests of the Party. 
 On what grounds, it may be asked? According to them, if rank-and-file Party members do not obey C. 
C. 
 decisions, they must be punished with all the severity of Party law; but if so-called leaders,members of the Political Bureau, say, violate C. 
C. 
 de-cisions, not only must they not be punished, they must simply not even be criticised, for criticism in sucha case is qualified by them as “being put through the mill. 
” Obviously, the Party cannot accept this false view. 
 If we were to proclaim one law for the leaders and an-other for the “common people” in the Party, there would be nothing left either of the Party or of Partydiscipline. 
 They complain of “being put through the mill. 
” But the hollowness of this complaint is apparent. 
 IfBukharin has the right to write such a crassly anti-Party article as the “Notes of an Economist,” then all the more have Party members the right to criticise suchan article. 
 If Bukharin and Tomsky allow themselves the right to violate a C. 
C. 
 decision by stubbornly re-fusing to work in the posts entrusted to them, then allthe more have Party members the right to criticise them for such conduct. 
 If this is what they call “being put through the mill,” then let them explain what theyunderstand by the slogan of self-criticism, inner-Party democracy, and so on. 
 It is said that Lenin would certainly have acted more mildly than the C. 
C. 
 is now acting towards Tomsky and Bukharin. 
 That is absolutely untrue. 
 The situation now is that two members of the Political Bureau system-atically violate C. 
C. 
 decisions, stubbornly refuse to remain in posts assigned to them by the Party, yet,instead of punishing them, the Central Committee of the Party has for two months already been trying to persuade them to remain in their posts. 
 And—justrecall—how did Lenin act in such cases? You surely remember that just for one small error committed by Tomsky, Comrade Lenin packed him off to Turke-stan. 
 Tomsky . 
 With Zinoviev’s benevolent assistance, and partly yours. 
 Stalin . 
 If what you mean to say is that Lenin could be persuaded to do anything of which he was not himself convinced, that can only arouse laughter. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Recallanother fact, for example, the case of Shlyapnikov, whose expulsion from the C. 
C. 
 Lenin recommended because he had criticised some draft decision of theSupreme Council of National Economy in the Party unit of that body. 
 Who can deny that Bukharin’s and Tomsky’s pres-ent crimes in grossly violating C. 
C. 
 decisions and openly creating a new opportunist platform against the Party are far graver than were the offences of Tomsky andShlyapnikov in the cases mentioned? Yet, not only is the Central Committee not demanding that either of them should be excluded from the C. 
C. 
 or be assignedto somewhere in Turkestan, but it is confining itself to attempts to persuade them to remain in their posts, while at the same time, of course, exposing their non-Party, and at times downright anti-Party, line. 
 What greater mildness do you want? Would it not be truer to say that we, the C. 
C. 
 ma-jority, are treating the Bukharinites too liberally and tolerantly, and that we are thereby, perhaps, involun-tarily encouraging their factional anti-Party “work”? Has not the time come to stop this liberalism? I recommend that the proposal of the majority of the members of this meeting be approved, and that we pass to the next business. 
 Published for the first time REPLY TO BILL-BELOTSERKOVSKY Comrade Bill-Belotserkovsky, I am very late in replying. 
 But better late than never. 
 1) I consider that to raise the question of “Rights” and “Lefts” in literature (and, hence, in the theatre al-so) is in itself incorrect. 
 In our country today the concept “Right” or “Left” is a Party concept, properly speaking an inner-Party concept. 
 “Rights” or “Lefts” are peo-ple who deviate to one side or the other from the purely Party line. 
 It would therefore be strange to apply these concepts to such a non-Party and incomparably wider sphere as literature, the theatre, and so on. 
 They might at a stretch be applied to some Party (communist) cir-cle in the field of literature. 
 Within such a circle theremight be “Rights” and “Lefts. 
” But to apply them to literature, at the present stage of its development, where there are trends of every description, even anti-Soviet anddownright counter-revolutionary trends, would be turn-ing all concepts topsy-turvy. 
 It would be truer in the case of literature to use class terms, or even the terms “Soviet,” “anti-Soviet,” “revolutionary,” “anti-revolu-tionary,” etc. 
 2) It follows from this that I cannot regard “Golo-vanovism”69 either as a “Right” or a “Left” danger—it lies outside the bounds of Party trends. 
 “Golovanovism”is a phenomenon of an anti-Soviet order. 
 It does not of course follow from this that Golovanov himself is incorrigible, that he cannot rid himself of his errors,that he has to be hounded and persecuted even when he is prepared to renounce his errors, that he must be forced in this way to leave the country. 
 Or take, for example, Bulgakov’s “Flight,” which likewise cannot be regarded as a manifestation either of a “Left” or a “Right” danger. 
 “Flight” is the mani-festation of an attempt to evoke pity, if not sympathy, for certain sections of the anti-Soviet émigrés—hence, an attempt to justify or semi-justify whiteguardism. 
In its present form, “Flight” is an anti-Soviet phenom-enon. 
 However, I should have nothing against the staging of “Flight,” if to his eight dreams Bulgakov were to add one or two others, where he depicted the inner social mainsprings of the civil war in the U. 
S. 
S. 
R. 
, sothat the audience might understand that all these Seraphims and all sorts of university lecturers, who are “honest” in their own way, were ejected from Russia notby the caprice of the Bolsheviks, but because (in spite of their “honesty”) they were sitting on the necks of the people, that, in expelling these “honest” supportersof exploitation, the Bolsheviks were carrying out the will of the workers and peasants and were therefore acting quite rightly. 
 3) Why are Bulgakov’s plays staged so often? Pre-sumably because we have not enough of our own plays suitable for staging. 
 For lack of the genuine article, even “Days of the Turbins” is accepted instead. 
 Of course, it is very easy to “criticise” and to demand thebanning of non-proletarian literature. 
 But what is easiest must not be considered the best. 
 It is not a matter of banning but of step by step ousting theold and new non-proletarian trash from the stage by competing against it, by creating genuine, interesting, artistic Soviet plays capable of replacing it. 
 Competi-tion is a big and serious matter, because only in an atmosphere of competition can we arrive at the for-mation and crystallisation of our proletarian litera-ture. 
 As to “Days of the Turbins” itself, it is not such a bad play, because it does more good than harm. 
 Don’tforget that the chief impression it leaves with the spec-tator is one that is favourable to the Bolsheviks: “If even such people as the Turbins are compelled to laydown their arms and submit to the will of the people because they realise that their cause is definitely lost, then the Bolsheviks must be invincible and there isnothing to be done about it. 
” “Days of the Turbins” is a demonstration of the all-conquering power of Bolshe-vism. 
 Of course, the author is altogether “innocent” of this demonstration. 
 But that is not our affair. 
 4) It is true that Comrade Svidersky very often com-mits the most incredible mistakes and distortions. 
 But it is also true that the Repertory Committee in its work commits at least as many mistakes, though of anopposite nature. 
 Recall “Crimson Island,” “Conspiracy of the Equals” and the similar trash that for some reason or other is so readily sanctioned for the really bourgeois Kamerny Theatre. 
 5) As to the “rumours” about “liberalism,” let us rather not talk about that—you would do better to leave “rumours” to the gossiping wives of Moscow traders.

 1, March 1, 1929 THE NATIONAL QUESTION AND LENINISM Reply to Comrades Meshkov, Kovalchuk, and Others I have received your letters. 
 They are similar to a number of letters on the same subject I have received from other comrades during the past few months. 
 I havedecided, however, to answer you particularly, because you put things more bluntly and thereby help the achieve-ment of clarity. 
 True, the answers you give in yourletters to the questions raised are wrong, but that is another matter—of that we shall speak below. 
 Let us get down to business. 
 1. 
 THE CONCEPT “NATION” The Russian Marxists have long had their theory of the nation. 
 According to this theory, a nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people,formed on the basis of the common possession of four principal characteristics, namely: a common language, a common territory, a common economic life, and a com-mon psychological make-up manifested in common spe-cific features of national culture. 
 This theory, as we know, has received general recognition in our Party. 
 It is evident from your letters that you consider this theory inadequate. 
 You therefore propose that the four characteristics of a nation be supplemented by a fifth, namely, that a nation possesses its own, separate na-tional state. 
 You consider that there is not and cannotbe a nation unless this fifth characteristic is present. 
 I think that the scheme you propose, with its new, fifth characteristic of the concept “nation,” is profoundlymistaken and cannot be justified either theoretically or in practice, politically. 
 According to your scheme, only such nations are to be recognised as nations as have their own state, sep-arate from others, whereas all oppressed nations which have no independent statehood would have to be deletedfrom the category of nations; moreover, the struggle of oppressed nations against national oppression and the struggle of colonial peoples against imperialism wouldhave to be excluded from the concept “national move-ment” and “national-liberation movement. 
” More than that. 
 According to your scheme we would have to assert: a) that the Irish became a nation only after the formation of the “Irish Free State,” and that beforethat they did not constitute a nation; b) that the Norwegians were not a nation before Norway’s secession from Sweden, and became a nationonly after that secession; c) that the Ukrainians were not a nation when the Ukraine formed part of tsarist Russia; that they becamea nation only after they seceded from Soviet Russia under the Central Rada and Hetman Skoropadsky, but again ceased to be a nation after they united theirUkrainian Soviet Republic with the other Soviet Repub-lics to form the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 
 A great many such examples could be cited. 
 Obviously, a scheme which leads to such absurd conclusions cannot be regarded as a scientific scheme. 
 In practice, politically, your scheme inevitably leads to the justification of national, imperialist oppres-sion, whose exponents emphatically refuse to recog-nise as real nations oppressed and unequal nations which have no separate national state of their own, and con-sider that this circumstance gives them the right tooppress these nations. 
 That is apart from the fact that your scheme pro-vides a justification for the bourgeois nationalists inour Soviet Republics who argue that the Soviet nations ceased to be nations when they agreed to unite their national Soviet Republics into a Union of Soviet So-cialist Republics. 
 That is how matters stand with regard to “supple-menting” and “amending” the Russian Marxist theoryof the nation. 
 Only one thing remains, and that is to admit that the Russian Marxist theory of the nation is the onlycorrect theory. 
 2. 
 THE RISE AND DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONS One of the grave mistakes you make is that you lump together all existing nations and fail to see any fun-damental difference between them. 
 There are different kinds of nations. 
 There are na-tions which developed in the epoch of rising capital-ism, when the bourgeoisie, destroying feudalism and feudal disunity, gathered the parts of nations together and cemented them. 
 These are the so-called “modern”nations. 
 You assert that nations arose and existed before capitalism. 
 But how could nations have arisen and ex-isted before capitalism, in the period of feudalism, when countries were split up into separate, independent principalities, which, far from being bound together bynational ties, emphatically denied the necessity for such ties? Your erroneous assertions notwithstanding, there were no nations in the pre-capitalist period, norcould there be, because there were as yet no national markets and no economic or cultural national centres, and, consequently, there were none of the factors whichput an end to the economic disunity of a given people and draw its hitherto disunited parts together into one national whole. 
 Of course, the elements of nationhood—language, territory, common culture, etc. 
—did not fall from the skies, but were being formed gradually, even in the pre-capitalist period. 
 But these elements were in a rudi-mentary state and, at best, were only a potentiality, that is, they constituted the possibility of the formationof a nation in the future, given certain favourable condi-tions. 
 The potentiality became a reality only in the pe-riod of rising capitalism, with its national market andits economic and cultural centres. 
 In this connection it would be well to recall the remarkable words of Lenin on the subject of the riseof nations, contained in his pamphlet What the “Friends- of the People ” Are and How They Fight the Social-Democrats . 
 Controverting the Narodnik Mikhailovsky, who derived the rise of nationalities and national unity from the development of gentile ties, Lenin says: “And so, national ties are a continuation and generalisation of gentile ties! Mr. 
 Mikhailovsky, evidently, borrows his ideas of the history of society from the fairy-tale that is taught to school-boys. 
 The history of society—this copybook doctrine runs—is that first there was the family, that nucleus of all society . 
 . 
 . 
 then the family grew into the tribe, and the tribe grew into the state. 
 If Mr. 
 Mikhailovsky solemnly repeats this childish non-sense, it only goes to show—apart from everything else—that he has not the slightest notion of the course even of Russian history. 
 While one might speak of gentile life in ancient Rus, there can be no doubt that by the Middle Ages, the era of the Muscovite tsars, these gentile ties no longer existed, that is to say, the state was based not at all on gentile unions but on territorial unions: the landlords and the monasteries took their peasants from va-rious localities, and the village communities thus formed werepurely territorial unions. 
 But one could hardly speak of national ties in the true sense of the word at that time: the state was divided into separate lands, sometimes even principalities, which pre-served strong traces of former autonomy, peculiarities of admin-istration, at times their own troops (the local boyars went to war at the head of their own companies), their own customs bor-ders, and so forth. 
 Only the modern period of Russian history (beginning approximately with the seventeenth century) is char-acterised by an actual merging of all such regions, lands and principalities into a single whole. 
 This merging, most esteemed Mr. 
 Mikhailovsky, was not brought about by gentile ties, nor even by their continuation and generalisation: it was brought about by the growth of exchange between regions, the gradual growth of commodity circulation and the concentration of the small local markets into a single, all-Russian market. 
 Since the leaders and masters of this process were the merchant capital-ists, the creation of these national ties was nothing but the crea-tion of bourgeois ties” (see V ol. 
 1, pp. 
 72-73 72). 
 That is how matters stand with regard to the rise of the so-called “modern” nations. 
 The bourgeoisie and its nationalist parties were throughout this period the chief leading force of such nations. 
 Class peace within the nation for the sake of “national unity”; expansion of the territory of one’s ownnation by seizure of the national territories of others; distrust and hatred of other nations, suppression of national minorities; a united front with imperialism—such is the ideological, social and political stock-in-trade of these nations. 
 Such nations must be qualified as bourgeois na-tions. 
 Examples are the French, British, Italian, North-American and other similar nations. 
 The Russian, Uk-rainian, Tatar, Armenian, Georgian and other nations inRussia were likewise bourgeois nations before the estab-lishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Soviet system in our country. 
 Naturally, the fate of such nations is linked with the fate of capitalism; with the fall of capitalism, such na-tions must depart from the scene. 
 It is precisely such bourgeois nations that Stalin’s pamphlet Marxism and the National Question has in mind when it says that “a nation is not merely a historical cat-egory but a historical category belonging to a definite epoch, the epoch of rising capitalism,” that “the fate of a national movement, which is essentially a bourgeoismovement, is naturally bound up with the fate of the bourgeoisie,” that “the final disappearance of a national movement is possible only with the downfall of the bour-geoisie,” and that “only under the reign of socialism can peace be fully established. 
” 73 That is how matters stand with regard to the bour-geois nations. 
 But there are other nations. 
 These are the new, Soviet nations, which developed and took shape on the basis of the old, bourgeois nations after the overthrow of capitalism in Russia, after the elimination of thebourgeoisie and its nationalist parties, after the estab-lishment of the Soviet system. 
 The working class and its internationalist party are the force that cements these new nations and leads them. 
 An alliance between the working class and the working peasantry within the nation for the elimina-tion of the survivals of capitalism in order that socialism may be built triumphantly; abolition of the survivals of national oppression in order that the nations and na-tional minorities may be equal and may develop freely; elimination of the survivals of nationalism in order that friendship may be knit between the peoples andinternationalism firmly established; a united front with all oppressed and unequal nations in the struggle against the policy of annexation and wars of annexa-tion, in the struggle against imperialism—such is the spiritual, and social and political complexion of these nations. 
 Such nations must be qualified as socialist nations. 
 These new nations arose and developed on the basis of old, bourgeois nations, as a result of the elimina-tion of capitalism—by their radical transformation on socialist lines. 
 Nobody can deny that the present so-cialist nations of the Soviet Union—the Russian, Uk-rainian, Byelorussian, Tatar, Bashkir, Uzbek, Kazakh, Azerbaijanian, Georgian, Armenian and other nations— differ radically from the corresponding old, bourgeois nations of the old Russia both in class composition and spiritual complexion and in social and political inter-ests and aspirations. 
 Such are the two types of nations known to history. 
 You do not agree with linking the fate of nations, in this case the old, bourgeois nations, with the fate of capitalism. 
 You do not agree with the thesis that, with the elimination of capitalism, the old, bourgeois na-tions will be eliminated. 
 But with what indeed could the fate of these nations be linked if not with the fate of capitalism? Is it so difficult to understand that whencapitalism disappears, the bourgeois nations it gave rise to must also disappear? Surely, you do not think that the old, bourgeois nations can exist and developunder the Soviet system, under the dictatorship of the proletariat? That would be the last straw. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 You are afraid that the elimination of the nations existing under capitalism is tantamount to the elimina-tion of nations in general, to the elimination of all nations. 
 Why, on what grounds? Are you really unawareof the fact that, besides bourgeois nations, there are other nations, socialist nations, which are much more solidly united and capable of surviving than any bour-geois nation? Your mistake lies precisely in the fact that you see no other nations except bourgeois nations, and, con-sequently, you have overlooked the whole epoch of for-mation of socialist nations in the Soviet Union, nations which arose on the ruins of the old, bourgeois nations. 
 The fact of the matter is that the elimination of the bourgeois nations signifies the elimination not of nations in general, but only of the bourgeois nations. 
 On the ruins of the old, bourgeois nations new, social-ist nations are arising and developing, and they arefar more solidly united than any bourgeois nation, be-cause they are exempt from the irreconcilable class con-tradictions that corrode the bourgeois nations, and arefar more representative of the whole people than any bourgeois nation. 
 3. 
 THE FUTURE OF NATIONS AND OF NATIONAL LANGUAGES You commit a grave error in putting a sign of equality between the period of the victory of socialism in one country and the period of the victory of socialismon a world scale, in asserting that the disappearance of national differences and national languages, the merging of nations and the formation of one common language,are possible and necessary not only with the victory of socialism on a world scale, but also with the victory of socialism in one country. 
 Moreover, you confuse en-tirely different things: “the abolition of national oppres-sion” with “the elimination of national differences,” “the abolition of national state barriers” with “the dyingaway of nations,” with “the merging of nations. 
” It must be pointed out that for Marxists to confuse these diverse concepts is absolutely impermissible. 
 Na-tional oppression in our country was abolished long ago, but it by no means follows from this that national differences have disappeared and that nations in ourcountry have been eliminated. 
 National state barriers, together with frontier guards and customs, were abolished in our country long ago, but it by no means follows from this that the nations have already become merged and that the national languages have disap-peared, that these languages have been supplanted by some one language common to all our nations. 
 You are displeased with the speech I delivered at the Communist University of the Peoples of the East (1925), 74 in which I repudiated the thesis that with the victory of socialism in one country , in our country, for example, national languages will die away, that the nations will be merged, and in place of the national lan-guages one common language will appear. 
 You consider that this statement of mine contra-dicts Lenin’s well-known thesis that it is the aim of so-cialism not only to abolish the division of mankind intosmall states and every form of isolation of nations, not only to bring the nations closer together, but also to merge them. 
 You consider, further, that it also contradicts an-other of Lenin’s theses, namely, that with the victory of socialism on a world scale , national differences and national languages will begin to die away, that after this victory national languages will begin to be sup-planted by one common language. 
 That is quite wrong, comrades. 
 It is a profound il-lusion. 
 I have already said that it is impermissible for Marx-ists to confuse and lump together such diverse phenom-ena as “the victory of socialism in one country” and “the victory of socialism on a world scale. 
” It shouldnot be forgotten that these diverse phenomena reflect two entirely different epochs, distinct from one another not only in time (which is very important), but in their very nature. 
 National distrust, national isolation, national en-mity and national conflicts are, of course, stimulated and fostered not by some “innate” sentiment of national animosity, but by the striving of imperialism to subju-gate other nations and by the fear inspired in these na-tions by the menace of national enslavement. 
 Undoubted-ly, so long as world imperialism exists this striving andthis fear will exist—and, consequently, national dis-trust, national isolation, national enmity and nation-al conflicts will exist in the vast majority of countries. 
Can it be asserted that the victory of socialism and the abolition of imperialism in one country signify the abolition of imperialism and national oppression inthe majority of countries? Obviously not. 
 But it follows from this that the victory of socialism in one country, notwithstanding the fact that it seriously weakensworld imperialism, does not and cannot create the conditions necessary for the merging of the nations and the national languages of the world into one integralwhole. 
 The period of the victory of socialism on a world scale differs from the period of the victory of socialismin one country primarily in the fact that it will abolish imperialism in all countries , will abolish both the striv-ing to subjugate other nations and the fear inspired bythe menace of national enslavement, will radically un-dermine national distrust and national enmity, will unite the nations into one world socialist economic system,and will thus create the real conditions necessary for the gradual merging of all nations into one. 
 Such is the fundamental difference between these two periods. 
 But it follows from this that to confuse these two different periods and to lump them together is to com-mit an unpardonable mistake. 
 Take the speech I de-livered at the Communist University of the Toilers ofthe East. 
 There I said: “Some people (Kautsky, for instance) talk of the creation of a single universal language and the dying away of all other lan-guages in the period of socialism. 
 I have little faith in this theory of a single, all-embracing language. 
 Experience, at any rate, speaks against rather than for such a theory. 
 Until now what has happenedhas been that the socialist revolution has not diminished but rather increased the number of languages; for, by stirring up the lowest sections of humanity and pushing them on to the political arena,it awakens to new life a number of hitherto unknown or little-known nationalities. 
 Who could have imagined that the old, tsarist Russia consisted of not less than fifty nations and national groups?The October Revolution, however, by breaking the old chains and bringing a number of forgotten peoples and nationalities on to the scene, gave them new life and a new development. 
” 75 From this passage it is evident that I was oppos-ing people of the type of Kautsky, who always was and has remained a dilettante on the national question, who does not understand the mechanics of the development ofnations and has no inkling of the colossal power of stabil-ity possessed by nations, who believes that the merging of nations is possible long before the victory of socialism,already under the bourgeois-democratic order, and who, servilely praising the assimilating “work” of the Ger-mans in Bohemia, light-mindedly asserts that the Czechsare almost Germanised, that, as a nation, the Czechs have no future. 
 From this passage it is evident, further, that what I had in mind in my speech was not the period of the victory of socialism on a world scale , but exclusively the period of the victory of socialism in one country . 
 And I affirmed (and continue to affirm) that the period of the victory of socialism in one country does not createthe necessary conditions for the merging of nations and national languages, that, on the contrary, this pe-riod creates favourable conditions for the renaissance andflourishing of the nations that were formerly oppressed by tsarist imperialism and have now been liberated from national oppression by the Soviet revolution. 
 From this passage it is apparent, lastly, that you have overlooked the colossal difference between the two different historical periods, that, because of this, youhave failed to understand the meaning of Stalin’s speech and, as a result, have got lost in the wilderness of your own errors. 
 Let us pass to Lenin’s theses on the dying away and merging of nations after the victory of socialism on a world scale. 
 Here is one of Lenin’s theses, taken from his article, “The Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination,” published in 1916, which, for somereason, is not quoted in full in your letters: “The aim of socialism is not only to abolish the division of mankind into small states and all isolation of nations, not only to draw the nations together, but to merge them. 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 Just as mankind can arrive at the abolition of classes only bypassing through a transition period of the dictatorship of the oppressed class, so mankind can arrive at the inevitable merging of nations only by passing through a transition period of complete liberation of all the oppressed nations, i. 
e. 
, of their freedom of secession” (see Vol. 
 XIX, p. 
 4076). 
 And here is another thesis of Lenin’s, which you like-wise do not quote in full: “As long as national and state differences exist among peo-ples and countries—and these differences will continue to exist for a very, very long time even after the dictatorship of the pro-letariat has been established on a world scale—the unity of in-ternational tactics of the communist working-class movement of all countries demands, not the elimination of variety, not the abolition of national differences (that is a foolish dream at the present moment), but such an application of the fundamental principles of communism (Soviet power and the dictatorship of the proletariat) as would correctly modify these principles in cer-tain particulars, correctly adapt and apply them to national and national-state differences” (V ol. 
 XXV, p. 
 227). 
 It should be noted that this passage is from Lenin’s pamphlet “ Left-Wing ” Communism , an Infantile Dis-order , published in 1920, that is, after the victory of the socialist revolution in one country, after the victory of socialism in our country. 
 From these passages it is evident that Lenin does not assign the process of the dying away of national dif-ferences and the merging of nations to the period of thevictory of socialism in one country, but exclusively to the period after the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat on a world scale, that is, to the periodof the victory of socialism in all countries, when the foundations of a world socialist economy have already been laid. 
 From these passages it is evident, further, that the attempt to assign the process of the dying away of nation-al differences to the period of the victory of socialism in one country, in our country, is qualified by Lenin as a “foolish dream. 
” From these passages it is evident, moreover, that Stalin was absolutely right when, in the speech he de-livered at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, he denied that it was possible for nationaldifferences and national languages to die away in the period of the victory of socialism in one country, in our country, and that you were absolutely wrong in uphold-ing something that is the direct opposite of Stalin’s thesis. 
 From these passages it is evident, lastly, that, in con-fusing the two different periods of the victory of social-ism, you failed to understand Lenin, distorted Lenin’s line on the national question and, as a consequence,involuntarily headed for a rupture with Leninism. 
 It would be incorrect to think that after the defeat of world imperialism national differences will be abol-ished and national languages will die away immediately, at one stroke, by decree from above, so to speak. 
 Noth-ing is more erroneous than this view. 
 To attempt tobring about the merging of nations by decree from above, by compulsion, would be playing into the hands of the imperialists, it would spell disaster to thecause of the liberation of nations, and be fatal to the cause of organising co-operation and fraternity among nations. 
 Such a policy would be tantamount to a pol-icy of assimilation. 
 You know, of course, that the policy of assimilation is absolutely excluded from the arsenal of Marxism-Leninism, as being an anti-popular and counter-revolu-tionary policy, a fatal policy. 
 Furthermore, we know that nations and national lan-guages possess an extraordinary stability and tremen-dous power of resistance to the policy of assimilation. 
The Turkish assimilators—the most brutal of all assimi-lators—mangled and mutilated the Balkan nations for hundreds of years, yet not only did they fail to destroythem, but in the end were forced to capitulate. 
 The tsar-ist-Russian Russifiers and the German-Prussian Ger-manisers, who yielded little in brutality to the Turkishassimilators, rent and mangled the Polish nation for over a hundred years, just as the Persian and Turkish assimilators for hundreds of years rent and mangled andmassacred the Armenian and Georgian nations, yet, far from destroying these nations, in the end they were al-so forced to capitulate. 
 All these circumstances must be taken into account in order correctly to forecast the probable course of events as regards the development of nations directly after thedefeat of world imperialism. 
 It would be a mistake to think that the first stage of the period of the world dictatorship of the proletar-iat will mark the beginning of the dying away of nations and national languages, the beginning of the formation of one common language. 
 On the contrary, the firststage, during which national oppression will be com-pletely abolished, will be a stage marked by the growth and flourishing of the formerly oppressed nations andnational languages, the consolidation of equality among nations, the elimination of mutual national distrust, and the establishment and strengthening of internationalties among nations. 
 Only in the second stage of the period of the world dictatorship of the proletariat, to the extent that a sin-gle world socialist economy is built up in place of the world capitalist economy—only in that stage will somethingin the nature of a common language begin to take shape; for only in that stage will the nations feel the need to have, in addition to their own national languages, acommon international language—for convenience of intercourse and of economic, cultural and political co-operation. 
 Consequently, in this stage, national lan-guages and a common international language will exist side by side. 
 It is possible that, at first, not one world economic centre will be formed, common to all nationsand with one common language, but several zonal eco-nomic centres for separate groups of nations, with a sep-arate common language for each group of nations, andthat only later will these centres combine into one common world socialist economic centre, with one lan-guage common to all the nations. 
 In the next stage of the period of world dictator-ship of the proletariat—when the world socialist system of economy becomes sufficiently consolidated and so-cialism becomes part and parcel of the life of the peo-ples, and when practice convinces the nations of the advantages of a common language over national lan-guages—national differences and languages will begin to die away and make room for a world language, common to all nations. 
 Such, in my opinion, is the approximate picture-of the future of nations, a picture of the development-of the nations along the path to their merging in the-future. 
 /hammersicle⋆ NOT FOR 4. 
 THE POLICY OF THE PARTY ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION One of your mistakes is that you regard the national question not as a part of the general question of the so-cial and political development of society, subordinatedto this general question, but as something self-contained and constant, whose direction and character remain basically unchanged throughout the course of history. 
Hence you fail to see what every Marxist sees, namely, that the national question does not always have one and the same character, that the character and tasks of thenational movement vary with the different periods in the development of the revolution. 
 Logically, it is this that explains the deplorable fact that you so lightly confuse and lump together di-verse periods of development of the revolution, and fail to understand that the changes in the character andtasks of the revolution in the various stages of its devel-opment give rise to corresponding changes in the char-acter and aims of the national question, that in conform-ity with this the Party’s policy on the national ques-tion also changes, and that, consequently, the Party’s policy on the national question in one period of de-velopment of the revolution cannot be violently severed from that period and arbitrarily transferred to another period. 
 The Russian Marxists have always started out from the proposition that the national question is a part of the general question of the development of the revolu-tion, that at different stages of the revolution the na-tional question has different aims, corresponding to the character of the revolution at each given historical moment, and that the Party’s policy on the national question changes in conformity with this. 
 In the period preceding the First World War, when history made a bourgeois-democratic revolution the task of the moment in Russia, the Russian Marxists linkedthe solution of the national question with the fate of the democratic revolution in Russia. 
 Our Party held that the overthrow of tsarism, the elimination of the sur-vivals of feudalism, and the complete democratisation of the country provided the best solution of the national question that was possible within the framework of cap-italism. 
 Such was the policy of the Party in that period. 
 It is to this period that Lenin’s well-known arti-cles on the national question belong, including the arti-cle “Critical Remarks on the National Question” where Lenin says: “. 
 . 
 . 
 I assert that there is only one solution of the national question, in so far as one is possible at all in the capitalist world— and that solution is consistent democratism. 
 In proof, I would cite, among others, Switzerland” (vol. 
 XVII, p. 
 15077). 
 To this same period belongs Stalin’s pamphlet, Marx-ism and the National Question , which among other things says: “The final disappearance of a national movement is possible only with the downfall of the bourgeoisie. 
 Only under the reign of socialism can peace be fully established. 
 But even within the framework of capitalism it is possible to reduce the national strug-gle to a minimum to undermine it at the root, to render it as harmless as possible to the proletariat. 
 This is borne out, for exam-ple, by Switzerland and America. 
 It requires that the country should be democratised and the nations be given the opportunity of free development. 
”78 In the next period, the period of the First World War, when the prolonged war between the two imperi-alist coalitions undermined the might of world imperi-alism, when the crisis of the world capitalist system reached an extreme degree, when, alongside the workingclass of the “metropolitan countries,” the colonial and dependent countries also joined the movement for eman-cipation, when the national question grew into the na-tional and colonial question, when the united front of the working class of the advanced capitalist countries and of the oppressed peoples of the colonies and dependentcountries began to be a real force, when, consequently, the socialist revolution became the question of the mo-ment, the Russian Marxists could no longer content them-selves with the policy of the preceding period, and they found it necessary to link the solution of the national and colonial question with the fate of the socialist rev-olution. 
 The Party held that the overthrow of the power of capi-tal and the organisation of the dictatorship of the prole-tariat, the expulsion of the imperialist troops from the colonial and dependent countries and the securing of the right of these countries to secede and to form their ownnational states, the elimination of national enmity and nationalism and the strengthening of international ties between peoples, the organisation of a single socialistnational economy and the establishment on this basis of fraternal co-operation among peoples, constituted the best solution of the national and colonial question underthe given conditions. 
 Such was the policy of the Party in that period. 
 That period is still far from having entered into full force, for it has only just begun; but there is no doubtthat it will yet have its decisive word to say.

 A question apart is the present period of develop-ment of the revolution in our country and the presentpolicy of the Party. 
 It should be noted that so far our country has proved to be the only one ready to overthrow capitalism. 
 And it really has overthrown capitalism and organised the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
 Consequently, we still have a long way to go to the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat on a world scale , and still more to the victory of socialism in all countries . 
 It should be noted, further, that in putting an end to the rule of the bourgeoisie, which has long since abandoned its old democratic traditions, we, in passing,solved the problem of the “complete democratisation of the country,” abolished the system of national oppression and established equality of nations in ourcountry. 
 As we know, these measures proved to be the best way of eliminating nationalism and national enmity,and of establishing mutual confidence among the peoples. 
 It should be noted, lastly, that the abolition of na-tional oppression led to the national revival of the for-merly oppressed nations of our country, to the develop-ment of their national cultures, to the strengthening of friendly, international ties among the peoples of ourcountry and to their mutual co-operation in the work of building socialism. 
 It should be borne in mind that these regenerated nations are not the old, bourgeois nations, led by the bourgeoisie, but new, socialist nations, which have aris-en on the ruins of the old nations and are led by the in-ternationalist party of the labouring masses. 
 In view of this, the Party considered it necessary to help the regenerated nations of our country to rise to their feet and attain their full stature, to revive and develop their national cultures, widely to develop schools, the-atres and other cultural institutions functioning in the native languages, to nationalise—that is, to staff with members of the given nation—the Party, trade-union,co-operative, state and economic apparatuses, to train their own, national, Party and Soviet cadres, and to curb all elements—who are, indeed, few in number—thattry to hinder this policy of the Party. 
 This means that the Party supports, and will continue to support, the development and flourishing of the na-tional cultures of the peoples of our country, that it will encourage the strengthening of our new, socialist na-tions, that it takes this matter under its protection andguardianship against anti-Leninist elements of any kind. 
 It is apparent from your letters that you do not approve this policy of our Party. 
 That is because, firstly, you confuse the new, socialist nations with the old, bourgeois nations and do not understand thatthe national cultures of our new, Soviet nations are in content socialist cultures. 
 Secondly, it is because—you will excuse my bluntness—you have a very poor graspof Leninism and are badly at sea on the national question. 
 Consider, by way of example, the following elemen-tary matter. 
 We all say that a cultural revolution is needed in our country. 
 If we mean this seriously and arenot merely indulging in idle chatter, then we must take at least the first step in this direction: namely, we must make primary education, and later secondary edu-cation, compulsory for all citizens of the country, irres-pective of their nationality. 
 It is obvious that without this no cultural development whatever, let alone the so-called cultural revolution, will be possible in our coun-try. 
 More, without this there will be neither any real progress of our industry and agriculture, nor any relia-ble defence of our country. 
 But how is this to be done, bearing in mind that the percentage of illiteracy in our country is still veryhigh, that in a number of nations of our country there are 80-90 per cent of illiterates? What is needed is to cover the country with an ex-tensive network of schools functioning in the native lan-guages, and to supply them with staffs of teachers who know the native languages. 
 What is needed is to nationalise—that is, to staff with members of the given nation—all the administra-tive apparatus, from Party and trade-union to state andeconomic. 
 What is needed is widely to develop the press, the theatre, the cinema and other cultural institutions func-tioning in the native languages. 
 Why in the native languages?—it may be asked. 
 Because only in their native, national languages can thevast masses of the people be successful in cultural, political and economic development. 
 In view of all that has been said, I think it should not he so difficult to understand that Leninists cannot pursue any other policy on the national question thanthe one which is now being pursued in our country— provided, of course, they want to remain Leninists. 
 Is not that so?Well, then let us leave it at that. 
 I think I have answered all your questions and doubts.

 153 42A Soviet Republic was proclaimed in Hungary on March 21, 1919. 
 Its position from the very first was a very difficult one. 
The country was in the throes of a severe financial and foodcrisis, and had to contend with internal counter-revolutionand with the Entente, which organised an economic blockadeof Soviet Hungary and armed intervention. 
 The Hungarian Social-Democrats who had joined the government of the Hungarian Republic conducted treasonable undermining activ-ities in the rear and at the front, and negotiated with Ententeagents for the overthrow of the Soviet power. 
 In August 1919 theHungarian revolution was crushed by the joint efforts of theinternal counter-revolution and the forces of intervention.

 It denies the class character of the state, rejects the class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and preaches the uniting of workers, intellectuals and technicians intoa federation of national industrial guilds and the conversionof the latter into organs of administration of industry withinthe framework of the bourgeois state. 
 By rejecting revolu-tionary methods of struggle, guild socialism condemns the working class to passivity and complete subordination to the bourgeoisie.

 In 1926-28 a group of actors of the Bolshoi Theatre,headed by orchestra conductor Golovanov, opposed the reformof the theatre’s repertory in conformity with the higher stand-ards and requirements of the broad strata of the working peopleand the tasks of socialist development. 
 The group took up a hostile attitude to the general body of the theatre and refused to promote young talent. 
 Measures taken by the Party for thereconstruction of the work of the Soviet theatres resulted in“Golovanovism” being overcome.
