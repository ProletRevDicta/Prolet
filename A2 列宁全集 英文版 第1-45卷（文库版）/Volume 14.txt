Lenin Collected Works: 
Volume 14

Preface by Progress Publishers



    Volume 14 contains V. I. Lenin's extremely important
    philosophical work Materialism and Empirio-criticism,
    written in 1908 and published in 1909, which was the theoretical
    preparation for the Bolshevik Party.
  

    In this work Lenin gave an all-round criticism of the anti-Marxist
    views of the Russian Machists and their foreign philosophical
    teachers. At the same time Lenin's work was a defence of the
    theoretical basis of Marxism —dialectical and historical
    materialism—and a materialist generalisation of all that was
    valuable and essential in the achievements of science, and
    especially natural science, during the period from the death of
    Engels to the appearance of Lenin's book Materialism and
    Empiric-criticism.
  

    This work has become a model of irreconcilable, party struggle
    against the enemies of dialectical and historical materialism.
  

    The volume includes also Lenin's “Ten Questions to a
    Lecturer”, written in the spring of 1908, which furnished the
    basis for the public dissociation of the Bolshevik group from the
    philosophical views of the Machist Bogdanov and his supporters, who
    had joined the Bolsheviks in 1905.
  

    Lenin's work Materialism and Empiric-criticism is printed
    in the present volume in accordance with the first edition of the
    book (1909) collated with the second edition (1920). In preparing
    the text account has been taken of the instructions given by Lenin
    in letters to relatives during the preparation of the book for the
    press in 1908-09 and in correcting the proofs of the first edition.

1. Does the lecturer acknowledge that the philosophy of Marxism
is dialectical materialism ?


If he does not, why has he never analysed Engels’
countless statements on this subject?


If he does, why do the Machists call their
“revision” of dialectical materialism “the
philosophy of Marxism"?


2. Does the lecturer acknowledge Engels’ fundamental
division of philosophical systems into idealism and
materialism,[2] Engels regarding those intermediate
between these two, wavering between them, as the line of Hume
in modern philosophy, calling this line
“agnosticism” and declaring Kantianism to be a
variety of agnosticism?


3. Does the lecturer acknowledge that recognition of the
external world and its reflection in the human mind form the
basis of the theory of knowledge of dialectical materialism?


4. Does the lecturer acknowledge as correct Engels’
argument concerning the conversion of
“things-in-themselves” into
“things-for-us”?[3]


5. Does the lecturer acknowledge as correct Engels’
assertion that the “real unity of the world consists in
its materiality”? (Anti-Dühring, 2nd ed., 1886, p. 28,
section I, part IV on world
schematism.)[4]


6. Does the lecturer acknowledge as correct Engels’
assertion that “matter without motion is as
inconceivable as motion without matter"?
(Anti-Dühring, 1886, 2nd ed., p. 45, in part 6
on natural philosophy, cosmogony, physics and
chemistry.)[5]


7. Does the lecturer acknowledge that the ideas of causality,
necessity, law, etc., are a reflection in the human mind of
laws of nature, of the real world? Or was Engels wrong in
saying so? (Anti-Dühring, S. 20-21, in part III on

    

apriorism, and S. 103-04, in part XI on freedom and
necessity.)[6]


8. Does the lecturer know that Mach expressed his agreement with
he head of the immanentist school, Schuppe, and even
dedicated his last and chief philosophical
work[7] to him?
How does the lecturer explain this adherence of Mach to the
obviously idealist philosophy of Schuppe, a defender of
clericalism and in general a downright reactionary
in philosophy?


9. Why did the lecturer keep silent about
“adventure” with his comrade of yesterday
(according to the Studies), the Menshevik Yushkevich, who has
oday declared Bogdanov (following in the wake of Rakhmetov)
an
idealist?[8] Is the lecturer aware that Petzoldt
in his latest book has classed a number of Mach’s disciples
among the
idealists?[9]


10. Does the lecturer confirm the fact that Machism has nothing
in common with Bolshevism? And that Lenin has repeatedly
protested against
Machism?[10] And that the Mensheviks Yushkevich
and Valentinov are “pure” empirio-criticists?


 
Notes
 
 



[1]

“Ten Questions to a Lecturer” was written by Lenin
during the first half of May 1908 in London. He had come there
from Geneva to work on his book Mateterialism and
Empirio-criticism, and he sent the questions to
I. F. Dubrovinsky, a member of the Bolshevik centre and one of
he editors of the newspaper Proletary, as theses for a
speech on the occasion of the lecture entitled “Adventures of
One Philosophical School” given by A. Bogdanov in Geneva on May 15 (28), 1908.


Bogdnnov, Lunacharsky and others, who supported Machist
standpoints in philosophy, took advantage of Lenin’s absence to
increase their activity. Under the guise of criticising
“materialism of the Plekhanov school”, they revised materialist
philosophy and tried to show that empirio-monism, the variety of
Machism invented by Bogdanov, and not dialectical materialism,
was the philosophy of Bolshevism.


In preparing his speech, Dubrovinsky made changes in the second,
hird and tenth questions and deleted the seventh question. In
his speech, which was based on Lenin’s theses, Dubrovinsky (who
used the pseudonym Dorov) sharply criticised Bogdanovs views,
declaring that Bolshevism had nothing in common with
empirio-monism and showing that the advocacy of “god-building"
was incompatible with dialectical materialism.

Notes
[1] The book Materialism and Empirio-criticism. Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy was written by Lenin during February to October 1908 in Geneva and London. It was published in Moscow in May 1909 by the Zveno Publishers. The manuscript of the book and Leninâs preparatory material for it have so far not been found.
The book is the outcome of a prodigious amount of creative scientific research carried out by Lenin during nine months. His main work on the book was carried out in Geneva libraries, but in order to obtain a detailed knowledge of the modern literature of philosophy and natural science be went in May 1908 to London, where he worked for about a month in the library of the British Museum. The list of sources quoted or mentioned by Lenin in his book exceeds 200 titles.
In December 1908 Lenin went from Geneva to Paris where he worked until April 1909 on correcting the proofs of his book. He had to agree to tone down some passages of the work so as not to give he tsarist censorship an excuse for prohibiting its publication. It was published in Russia under great difficulties. Lenin insisted on the speedy issue of the book, stressing that ânot only literary but also serious political obligationsâ were involved in its publication.
Leninâs work Materialism and Empirio-criticism played a decisive part in combating the Machist revision of Marxism. It enabled the philosophical ideas of Marxism to spread widely among the mass of party members and helped the party activists and progressive workers to master dialectical and historical materialism.
This classical work of Leninâs has achieved a wide circulation in many countries, and has been published in over 20 languages.

## Preface to the First Edition








Materialism and Empirio-criticism: Preface to the First Edition



V.I. Lenin
Materialism and Empirio-criticism
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy


Preface



Preface to the First Edition
A number of writers, would-be Marxists, have this year undertaken a veritable campaign against the philosophy of Marxism. In the course of less than half a year four books devoted mainly and almost exclusively to attacks on dialectical materialism have made their appearance. These include first and foremost Studies in [?âit would have been more proper to say âagainstâ] the Philosophy of Marxism (St. Petersburg, 1908), a symposium by Bazarov, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Berman, Helfond, Yushkevich and Suvorov; Yushkevichâs Materialism and Critical Realism ; Bermanâs Dialectics in the Light of the Modern Theory of Knowledge and Valentinovâs The Philosophical Constructions of Marxism.
All these people could not have been ignorant of the fact that Marx and Engels scores of times termed their philosophical views dialectical materialism. Yet all these people, who, despite the sharp divergence of their political views, are united in their hostility towards dialectical materialism, at the same time claim to be Marxists in philosophy! Engelsâ dialectics is âmysticism,â says Berman. Engelsâ views have become âantiquated,â remarks Bazarov casually, as though it were a self-evident fact. Materialism thus appears to be refuted by our bold warriors, who proudly allude to the âmodern theory of knowledge,â ârecent philosophyâ (or ârecent positivismâ), the âphilosophy of modern natural science,â or even the âphilosophy of natural science of the twentieth century.â Supported by all these supposedly recent doctrines, our destroyers of dialectical materialism proceed fearlessly to downright fideism[1] [3] (in the case of Lunacharsky it is most evident, but by no means in his case alone![4]). Yet when it comes to an explicit definition of their attitude towards Marx and Engels, all their courage and all their respect for their own convictions at once disappear. In deedâa complete renunciation of dialectical materialism, i.e., of Marxism; in wordâendless subterfuges, attempts to evade the essence of the question, to cover their retreat, to put some materialist or other in place of materialism in general, and a determined refusal to make a direct analysis of the innumerable materialist declarations of Marx and Engels. This is truly âmutiny on oneâs knees,â as it was justly characterised by one Marxist. This is typical philosophical revisionism, for it was only the revisionists who gained a sad notoriety for themselves by their departure from the fundamental views of Marxism and by their fear, or inability, to âsettle accountsâ openly, explicitly, resolutely and clearly with the views they had abandoned. When orthodox Marxists had occasion to pronounce against some antiquated views of Marx (for instance, Mehring when he opposed certain historical propositions), it was always done with such precision and thoroughness that no one has ever found anything ambiguous in such literary utterances.
For the rest, there is in the Studies âinâ the Philosophy of Marxism one phrase which resembles the truth. This is Lunacharskyâs phrase: âPerhaps we [i.e., all the collaborators of the Studies evidently][2] have gone astray, but we are seekingâ (p. 161). That the first half of this phrase contains an absolute and the second a relative truth, I shall endeavour to demonstrate circumstantially in the present book. At the moment I would only remark that if our philosophers had spoken not in the name of Marxism but in the name of a few âseekingâ Marxists, they would have shown more respect for themselves and for Marxism.
As for myself, I too am a âseekerâ in philosophy. Namely, the task I have set myself in these comments is to find out what was the stumbling block to these people who under the guise of Marxism are offering something incredibly muddled, confused and reactionary.
â Vladimir Lenin. September 1908.


Notes
[1] Fideism is a doctrine which substitutes faith for knowledge, or which generally attaches significance to faith. âLenin
[2] Interpolations in square brackets (within passages quoted by Lenin) have been introduced by Lenin, unless otherwise indicated.âEd.
[3] V. I. Lenin in a letter to A. I, Ulyanova-Yelizarova, dated October 20 (November 8), 1908, wrote: â...if considerations due to the censorship prove very severe, the word âclericalismâ could be replaced everywhere by the word âfideismâ with an explanatory note (âfideismâ is a doctrine which substitutes faith for knowledge, or which generally attaches significance to faith). This is in case of needâto explain the nature of the concessions which I am ready to make.â (see Collected Works, present edition, Vol. 37, p. 395). In another letter to his sister, Lenin proposed replacing the word âclericalismâ by the word âShamanismâ, to which she answered. âIt is already too late for Shamanism. And is it really better?â (Ibid., p. 662). From the text of the book Materialism and Empirio-criticism it can be seen that the word âfideismâ was substituted for âclericalismâ, although the latter word remained unaltered in some places. The note suggested by Lenin was given in the first edition of the book and was retained in subsequent editions.
[4] Lenin is referring to a religious-philosophical tendency hostile to Marxism called âgod-buildingâ, which arose in the period of reaction among a section of the party intellectuals who had deserted Marxism after the defeat of the revolution of 1905â07. The âgod-buildersâ (A. V. Lunacharsky, V.Bazarov and others) preached the creation of a new âsocialistâ religion in an attempt toâreconcile Marxism with religion. At one time A. M. Gorky supported them.
An enlarged meeting of the editorial board of Proletary (1909) condemned âgod-buildingâ and stated in a special resolution that the Bolshevik group has nothing in common with âsuch a distortion of scientific socialismâ. The reactionary nature of âgod-buildingâ was exposed by Lenin in his work Materialism and Empirio-criticism an din his letters to Gorky of February-April 1908 and November-December 1913.

Materialism and Empirio-criticism: Preface to the Second Edition



V.I. Lenin
Materialism and Empirio-criticism
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy


Preface



Preface to the Second Edition
With the exception of a few corrections in the text, the present edition does not differ from the previous one. I hope that, irrespective of the dispute with the Russian âMachians,â it will prove useful as an aid to an acquaintance with the philosophy of Marxism, dialectical materialism, as well as with the philosophical conclusions from the recent discoveries in natural science. As for A. A. Bogdanovâs latest works, which I have had no opportunity to examine, the appended article by Comrade V. I. Nevsky gives the necessary information.[1] Comrade V.I. Nevsky, not only in his work as a propagandist in general, but also as an active worker in the Party school in particular, has had ample opportunity to convince himself that under the guise of âproletarian cultureâ[2] A. A. Bogdanov is imparting bourgeois and reactionary views.
â Vladimir Lenin. 2nd September, 1920.


Notes
[1] V. I. Nevskyâs article âDialectical Materialism and the Philosophy of Dead Reactionâ was published in 1920 as an appendix to the second edition of the book Materialism and Empirio-criticism.
[2] A. Bogdanov put forward the idea of âproletarian cultureâ as early as 1909, by which he meant that the proletariat should elaborate its âownâ culture in contradistinction to that of the past.
After the October Socialist Revolution Bogdanov and his fellow-thinkers adopted the so-called proletarian cultrual-educational organisations (Proletcult) as the field of their activities. With the aid of this convenient rostrum, they began actively to propagade anti-Marxist views, virtually denied the importance of the cultrual inheritance of the past, and endeavoured âby laboratory methodsâ divorced from life to create a culture for the proletariat, counterposing the latter to the rest of the working people and above all to the peasantry.
Lenin waged a consistent struggle against the separatism and sectarianism of the Proletcult and against the anti-Marxist views of its ideologists. In 1920 the Central Committee of the Party adopted a special decision on subordination of the activities of the Proletcult to the Peopleâs Commissariat for Education. In the twenties, the Proletcult organisations began to decline and in 1932 they ceased to exist.

## In Lieu of an Introduction








Materialism and Empirio-criticism: In Lieu of An Introduction



V.I. Lenin
Materialism and Empirio-criticism
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy


In Lieu of An Introduction



How Certain âMarxistsâ in 1908 and Certain Idealists in 1710 Refuted Materialism
Anyone in the least acquainted with philosophical literature must know that scarcely a single contemporary professor of philosophy (or of theology) can be found who is not directly or indirectly engaged in refuting materialism. They have declared materialism refuted a thousand times, yet are continuing to refute it for the thousand and first time. All our revisionists are engaged in refuting materialism, pretending, however, that actually they are only refuting the materialist Plekhanov, and not the materialist Engels, nor the materialist Feuerbach, nor the materialist views of J. Dietzgenâand, moreover, that they are refuting materialism from the standpoint of ârecentâ and âmodernâ positivism, natural science, and so forth. Without citing quotations, which anyone desiring to do so could cull by the hundred from the books above mentioned, I shall refer to those arguments by which materialism is being combated by Bazarov, Bogdanov, Yushkevich, Valentinov, Chernov [V. Chernov, Philosophical and Sociological Studies, Moscow, 1907. The author is as ardent an adherent of Avenarius and an enemy of dialectical materialism as Bazarov and Co.] and other Machians. I shall use this latter term throughout as a synonym for âempirio-criticistâ because it is shorter and simpler and has already acquired rights of citizenship in Russian literature. That Ernst Mach is the most popular representative of empirio-criticism today is universally acknowledged in philosophical literature, [See, for instance, Dr. Richard HÃ¶nigswald, Ueber die Lehre Humes von der RealitÃ¤t der Aussendinge [Humeâs Doctrine of the Reality of the External World], Berlin, 1904, S. 26. 1 of âmetaphysicsâ, a double of religion (âholy matterâ, as Bazarov says).] while Bogdanovâs and Yushkevichâs departures from âpureâ Machism are of absolutely secondary importance, as will be shown later.
The materialists, we are told, recognise something unthinkable and unknowableââthings-in-themselvesââmatter âoutside of experienceâ and outside of our knowledge. They lapse into genuine mysticism by admitting the existence of something beyond, something transcending the bounds of âexperienceâ and knowledge. When they say that matter, by acting upon our sense-organs, produces sensations, the materialists take as their basis the âunknown,â nothingness; for do they not themselves declare our sensations to be the only source of knowledge? The materialists lapse into âKantianismâ (Plekhanov, by recognising the existence of âthings-in-themselves,â i.e., things outside of our consciousness); they âdoubleâ the world and preach âdualism,â for the materialists hold that beyond the appearance there is the thing-in-itself; beyond the immediate sense data there is something else, some fetish, an âidol,â an absolute, a source of knowledge? The materialists lapse into âKantianismâ (Plekhanov, by recongnising the existence of âthings-in-itself; beyond the immediate sense data there is something else, some fetish, an âidol", an absolute, a source of âmetaphysics", a double of religion ("holy matter", as Barzarov says).
Such are the arguments levelled by the Machians against materialism, as repeated and retold in varying keys by the afore-mentioned writers.
In order to test whether these arguments are new, and whether they are really directed against only one Russian materialist who âlapsed into Kantianism,â we shall give some detailed quotations from the works of an old idealist, George Berkeley. This historical inquiry is all the more necessary in the introduction to our comments since we shall have frequent occasion to refer to Berkeley and his trend in philosophy, for the Machians misrepresent both the relation of Mach to Berkeley and the essence of Berkeleyâs philosophical line.
The work of Bishop George Berkeley, published in 1710 under the title Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledgeâ[1] begins with the following argument:
âIt is evident to anyone who takes a survey of the objects of human knowledge, that they are either ideas actually imprinted on the senses; or else such as are perceived by attending to the passions and operations of the mind; or lastly, ideas formed by help of memory and imagination. . . . By sight I have the ideas of light and colours, with their several degrees and variations. By touch I perceive hard and soft, heat and cold, motion and resistance. . . . Smelling furnishes me with odours; the palate with tastes; and hearing conveys sounds. . . . And as several of these are observed to accompany each other, they come to be marked by one name, and so to be reputed as one thing. Thus, for example, a certain colour, taste, smell, figure and consistence having been observed to go together, are accounted one distinct thing, signified by the name apple; other collections of ideas constitute a stone, a tree, a book, and the like sensible things. . .â (Â§ 1).
Such is the content of the first section of Berkeleyâs work. We must remember that Berkeley takes as the basis of his philosophy âhard, soft, heat, cold, colours, tastes, odours,â etc. For Berkeley, things are âcollections of ideas,â this expression designating the aforesaid, let us say, qualities or sensations, and not abstract thoughts.
Berkeley goes on to say that besides these âideas or objects of knowledgeâ there exists something that perceives themâ"mind, spirit, soul or myself â (Â§ 2). It is self-evident, the philosopher concludes, that âideasâ cannot exist outside of the mind that perceives them. In order to convince ourselves of this it is enough to consider the meaning of the word âexist.â âThe table I write on I say exists, that is, I see and feel it; and if I were out of my study I should say it existed; meaning thereby that if I was in my study I might perceive it. . . .â That is what Berkeley says in Â§ 3 of his work and thereupon he begins a polemic against the people whom he calls materialists (Â§Â§ 18, 19, etc.). âFor as to what is said of the absolute existence of unthinking things, without any relation to their being perceived,â he says, âthat is to me perfectly unintelligible.â To exist means to be perceived ("Their esse is percipi,â Â§ 3âa dictum of Berkeleyâs frequently quoted in textbooks on the history of philosophy). âIt is indeed an opinion strangely prevailing amongst men, that houses, mountains, rivers, and in a word all sensible objects have an existence, natural or real, distinct from their being perceived by the understandingâ (Â§ 4). This opinion is a âmanifest contradiction,â says Berkeley. âFor, what are the afore-mentioned objects but the things we perceive by sense? and what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations? and is it not plainly repugnant that any one of these, or any combination of them, should exist unperceived?â (Â§ 4).
The expression âcollection of ideasâ Berkeley now replaces by what to him is an equivalent expression, combination of sensations, and accuses the materialists of a ârepugnantâ tendency to go still further, of seeking some source of this complexâthat is, of this combination of sensations. In Â§ 5 the materialists are accused of trifling with an abstraction, for to divorce the sensation from the object, according to Berkeley, is an empty abstraction. âIn truth,â he says at the end of Â§ 5, omitted in the second edition, âthe object and the sensation are the same thing, and cannot therefore be abstracted from each other.â Berkeley goes on:
âBut, say you, though the ideas themselves do not exist without the mind, yet there may be things like them, whereof they are copies or resemblances; which things exist without the mind, in an unthinking substance. I answer, an idea can be like nothing but an idea; a colour or figure can be like nothing but another colour or figure. . . . I ask whether those supposed originals, or external things, of which our ideas are the pictures or representations, be themselves perceivable or not? If they are, then they are ideas and we have gained our point; but if you say they are not, I appeal to anyone whether it be sense to assert a colour is like something which is invisible; hard or soft, like something which is intangible; and so of the rest.â (Â§ 8).
As the reader sees, Bazarovâs âargumentsâ against Plekhanov concerning the problem of whether things can exist outside of us apart from their action on us do not differ in the least from Berkeleyâs arguments against the materialists whom he does not mention by name. Berkeley considers the notion of the existence of âmatter or corporeal substanceâ (Â§ 9) such a âcontradiction,â such an âabsurdityâ that it is really not worth wasting time exposing it. He says:
âBut because the tenet of the existence of Matter seems to have taken so deep a root in the minds of philosophers, and draws after it so many ill consequences, I choose rather to be thought prolix and tedious than omit anything that might conduce to the full discovery and extirpation of that prejudiceâ (Â§ 9).
We shall presently see to what ill consequences Berkeley is referring. Let us first finish with his theoretical arguments against the materialists. Denying the âabsoluteâ existence of objects, that is, the existence of things outside human knowledge, Berkeley bluntly defines the viewpoint of his opponents as being that they recognise the âthing-in-itself.â In Â§ 24 Berkeley writes in italics that the opinion which he is refuting recognises âthe absolute existence of sensible objects in themselves, or without the mindâ (op. cit., pp. 167-68). The two fundamental lines of philosophical outlook are here depicted with the straightforwardness, clarity and precision that distinguish the classical philosophers from the inventors of ânewâ systems in our day. Materialism is the recognition of âobjects in themselves,â or outside the mind; ideas and sensations are copies or images of those objects. The opposite doctrine (idealism) claims that objects do not exist âwithout the mind"; objects are âcombinations of sensations.â
This was written in 1710, fourteen years before the birth of Immanuel Kant, yet our Machians, supposedly on the basis of ârecentâ philosophy, have made the discovery that the recognition of âthings-in-themselvesâ is a result of the infection or distortion of materialism by Kantianism! The ânewâ discoveries of the Machians are the product of an astounding ignorance of the history of the basic philosophical trends.
Their next ânewâ thought consists in this: that the concepts âmatterâ or âsubstanceâ are remnants of old uncritical views. Mach and Avenarius, you see, have advanced philosophical thought, deepened analysis and eliminated these âabsolutes,â âunchangeable entities,â etc. If you wish to check such assertions with the original sources, go to Berkeley and you will see that they are pretentious fictions. Berkeley says quite definitely that matter is ânonentityâ (Â§ 68), that matter is nothing (Â§ 80). âYou may,â thus Berkeley ridicules the materialists, âif so it shall seem good, use the word âmatterâ in the same sense as other men use ânothingââ (op. cit., pp. 196-97). At the beginning, says Berkeley, it was believed that colours, odours, etc., âreally exist,â but subsequently such views were renounced, and it was seen that they only exist in dependence on our sensations. But this elimination of old erroneous concepts was not completed; a remnant is the concept âsubstanceâ (Â§ 73), which is also a âprejudiceâ (p. 195), and which was finally exposed by Bishop Berkeley in 1710! In 1908 there are still wags who seriously believe Avenarius, Petzoldt, Mach and the rest, when they maintain that it is only ârecent positivismâ and ârecent natural scienceâ which have at last succeeded in eliminating these âmetaphysicalâ conceptions.
These same wags (Bogdanov among them) assure their readers that it was the new philosophy that explained the error of the âduplication of the worldâ in the doctrine of the eternally refuted materialists, who speak of some sort of a âreflectionâ by the human consciousness of things existing outside the consciousness. A mass of sentimental verbiage has been written by the above-named authors about this âduplication.â Owing to forgetfulness or ignorance, they failed to add that these new discoveries had already been discovered in 1710. Berkeley says:
âOur knowledge of these [i.e., ideas or things] has been very much obscured and confounded, and we have been led into very dangerous errors by supposing a twofold existence of the objects of senseâthe one intelligible or in the mind, the other real and without the mindâ (i.e., outside consciousness). And Berkeley ridicules this âabsurdâ notion, which admits the possibility of thinking the unthinkable! The source of the âabsurdity,â of course, follows from our supposing a difference between âthingsâ and âideasâ (Â§ 87), âthe supposition of external objects.â This same sourceâas discovered by Berkeley in 1710 and rediscovered by Bogdanov in 1908âengenders faith in fetishes and idols. âThe existence of Matter,â says Berkeley, âor bodies unperceived, has not only been the main support of Atheists and Fatalists, but on the same principle doth Idolatry likewise in all its various forms dependâ (Â§ 94).
Here we arrive at those âill consequencesâ derived from the âabsurdâ doctrine of the existence of an external world which compelled Bishop Berkeley not only to refute this doctrine theoretically, but passionately to persecute its adherents as enemies.
âFor as we have shown the doctrine of Matter or corporeal Substance to have been the main pillar and support of Scepticism, so likewise upon the same foundation have been raised all the impious schemes of Atheism and Irreligion. . . . How great a friend material substance has been to Atheists in all ages were needless to relate. All their monstrous systems have so visible and necessary a dependence on it, that when this cornerstone is once removed, the whole fabric cannot choose but fall to the ground, in so much that it is no longer worth while to bestow a particular consideration on the absurdities of every wretched sect of Atheistsâ (Â§ 92, op. cit., pp. 203-04).
âMatter being once expelled out of nature drags with it so many sceptical and impious notions, such an incredible number of disputes and puzzling questions [âthe principle of economy of thought,â discovered by Mach in the âseventies, âphilosophy as a conception of the world according to the principle of minimum expenditure of effort"âAvenarius in 1876!] which have been thorns in the sides of divines as well as philosophers, and made so much fruitless work for mankind, that if the arguments we have produced against it are not found equal to demonstration (as to me they evidently seem), yet I am sure all friends to knowledge, peace, and religion have reason to wish they wereâ (Â§ 96).
Frankly and bluntly did Bishop Berkeley argue! In our time these very same thoughts on the âeconomicalâ elimination of âmatterâ from philosophy are enveloped in a much more artful form, and confused by the use of a ânewâ terminology, so that these thoughts may be taken by naÃ¯ve people for ârecentâ philosophy!
But Berkeley was not only candid as to the tendencies of his philosophy, he also endeavoured to cover its idealistic nakedness, to represent it as being free from absurdities and acceptable to âcommon sense.â Instinctively defending himself against the accusation of what would nowadays be called subjective idealism and solipsism, he says that by our philosophy âwe are not deprived of any one thing in natureâ (Â§ 34). Nature remains, and the distinction between realities and chimeras remains, only âthey both equally exist in the mind.â

âI do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend, either by sense or reflection. That the things I see with my eyes and touch with my hands do exist, really exist, I make not the least question. The only thing whose existence we deny is that which philosophers [Berkeleyâs italics] call Matter or corporeal substance. And in doing this there is no damage done to the rest of mankind, who, I dare say, will never miss it. . . . The Atheist indeed will want the colour of an empty name to support his impiety. . . .â
This thought is made still clearer in Â§ 37, where Berkeley replies to the charge that his philosophy destroys corporeal substance:
â. . . if the word substance be taken in the vulgar sense, for a combination of sensible qualities, such as extension, solidity, weight, and the likeâthis we cannot be accused of taking away; but if it be taken in a philosophic sense, for the support of accidents or qualities without the mindâthen indeed I acknowledge that we take it away, if one may be said to take away that which never had any existence, not even in the imagination.â
Not without good cause did the English philosopher, Fraser, an idealist and adherent of Berkeleianism, who published Berkeleyâs works and supplied them with his own annotations designate Berkeleyâs doctrine by the term ânatural realismâ (op. cit., p. x). This amusing terminology must by all means be noted, for it in fact expresses Berkeleyâs intention to counterfeit realism. In our further exposition we shall frequently find ârecentâ âpositivistsâ repeating the same stratagem or counterfeit in a different form and in a different verbal wrapping. Berkeley does not deny the existence of real things! Berkeley does not go counter to the opinion of all humanity! Berkeley denies âonlyâ the teaching of the philosophers, viz., the theory of knowledge, which seriously and resolutely takes as the foundation of all its reasoning the recognition of the external world and the reflection thereof in the minds of men. Berkeley does not deny natural science, which has always adhered (mostly unconsciously) to this, i.e., the materialist, theory of knowledge. We read in Â§ 59:
âWe may, from the experience [Berkeleyâa philosophy of âpure experienceâ][2] we have had of the train and succession of ideas in our minds . . . make . . . well-grounded predictions concerning the ideas we shall be affected with pursuant to a great train of actions, and be enabled to pass a right judgement of what would have appeared to us, in case we were placed in circumstances very different from those we are in at present. Herein consists the knowledge of nature, which [listen to this!] may preserve its use and certainty very consistently with what hath been said.â
Let us regard the external world, nature, as âa combination of sensationsâ evoked in our mind by a deity. Acknowledge this and give up searching for the âgroundâ of these sensations outside the mind, outside man, and I will acknowledge within the framework of my idealist theory of knowledge all natural science and all the use and certainty of its deductions. It is precisely this framework, and only this framework, that I need for my deductions in favour of âpeace and religion.â Such is Berkeleyâs train of thought. It correctly expresses the essence of idealist philosophy and its social significance, and we shall encounter it later when we come to speak of the relation of Machism to natural science.
Let us now consider another recent discovery that was borrowed from Bishop Berkeley in the twentieth century by the recent positivist and critical realist, P. Yushkevich. This discovery is âempirio-symbolism.â âBerkeley,â says Fraser âthus reverts to his favourite theory of a Universal Naturai Symbolismâ (op. cit., p. 190). Did these words not occur in an edition of 1871, one might have suspected the English fideist philosopher Fraser of plagiarising both the modern mathematician and physicist Poincare and the Russian âMarxistâ Yushkevich!
This theory of Berkeleyâs, which threw Fraser into raptures, is set forth by the Bishop as follows:
âThe connexion of ideas [do not forget that for Berkeley ideas and things are identical] does not imply the relation of cause and effect, but only of a mark or sign with the thing signifiedâ (Â§ 65). âHence, it is evident that those things, which under the notion of a cause co-operating or concurring to the production of effects, are altogether inexplicable, and run us into great absurdities, may be very naturally explained . . . when they are considered only as marks or signs for our informationâ (Â§ 66). Of course, in the opinion of Berkeley and Fraser, it is no other than the deity who informs us by means of these âempirio-symbols.â The epistemological significance of symbolism in Berkeleyâs theory, however, consists in this, that it is to replace âthe doctrineâ which âpretends to explain things by corporeal causesâ (Â§ 66).
We have before us two philosophical trends in the question of causality. One âpretends to explain things by corporeal causes.â It is clear that it is connected with the âdoctrine of matterâ refuted as an âabsurdityâ by Bishop Berkeley. The other reduces the ânotion of causeâ to the notion of a âmark or signâ which serves for âour informationâ (supplied by God). We shall meet these two trends in a twentieth-century garb when we analyse the attitudes of Machism and dialectical materialism to this question.
Further, as regards the question of reality, it ought also to be remarked that Berkeley, refusing as he does to recognise the existence of things outside the mind, tries to find a criterion for distinguishing between the real and the fictitious. In Â§ 36 he says that those âideasâ which the minds of men evoke at pleasure âare faint, weak, and unsteady in respect to others they perceive by sense; which, being impressed upon them according to certain rules or laws of nature, speak themselves about the effects of a Mind more powerful and wise than human spirits. These latter are said to have more reality in them than the former; by which is meant that they are more affecting, orderly and distinct, and that they are not fictions of the mind perceiving them. . . .â Elsewhere (Â§ 84) Berkeley tries to connect the notion of reality with the simultaneous perception of the same sensations by many people. For instance, how shall we resolve the question as to whether the transformation of water into wine, of which we are being told, is real? âIf at table all who were present should see, and smell, and taste, and drink wine, and find the effects of it, with me there could be no doubt of its reality.â And Fraser explains: âSimultaneous perception of the âsameâ. . . sense-ideas, by different persons, as distinguished from purely individual consciousness of feelings and fancies, is here taken as a test of the . . . reality of the former.â
From this it is evident that Berkeleyâs subjective idealism is not to be interpreted as though it ignored the distinction between individual and collective perception. On the contrary, he attempts on the basis of this distinction to construct a criterion of reality. Deriving âideasâ from the action of a deity upon the human mind, Berkeley thus approaches objective idealism: the world proves to be not my idea but the product of a single supreme spiritual cause that creates both the âlaws of natureâ and the laws distinguishing âmore realâ ideas from less real, and so forth.
In another work, The Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous (1713), where he endeavours to present his views in an especially popular form, Berkeley sets forth the opposition between his doctrine and the materialist doctrine in the following way:
"I assert as well as you [materialists] that, since we are affected from without, we must allow Powers to be without, in a Being distinct from ourselves. . . . But then we differ as to the kind of this powerful being. I will have it to be Spirit, you Matter, or I know not what (I may add too, you know not what) third nature. . .â (op. cit., p. 335).
This is the gist of the whole question; Fraser comments: according to the materialists, sensible phenomena are due to material substance, or to some unknown âthird nature"; according to Berkeley, to rational Will; according to Hume and the Positivists, their origin is absolutely unknown, and we can only generalise them inductively, through custom, as facts.
Here the English Berkeleian, Fraser, approaches from his consistent idealist standpoint the same fundamental âlinesâ in philosophy which were so clearly characterised by the materialist Engels. In his work Ludwig Feuerbach Engels divides philosophers into âtwo great camps"âmaterialists and idealists. Engelsâdealing with theories of the two trends much more developed, varied and rich in content than Fraser dealt withâsees the fundamental distinction between them in the fact that while for the materialists nature is primary and spirit secondary, for the idealists the reverse is the case. In between these two camps Engels places the adherents of Hume and Kant, who deny the possibility of knowing the world, or at least of knowing it fully, and calls them agnostics[8]. In his Ludwig Feuerbach Engels applies this term only to the adherents of Hume (those people whom Fraser calls, and who like to call themselves, âpositivists"). But in his article âOn Historical Materialism,â Engels explicitly speaks of the standpoint of âthe Neo-Kantian agnostic,"[9]â regarding Neo-Kantianism[10] as a variety of agnosticism.[3]
We cannot dwell here on this remarkably correct and profound judgment of Engelsâ (a judgment which is shamelessly ignored by the Machians). We shall discuss it in detail later on. For the present we shall confine ourselves to pointing to this Marxist terminology and to this meeting of extremes: the views of a consistent materialist and of a consistent idealist on the fundamental philosophical trends. In order to illustrate these trends (with which we shall constantly have to deal in our further exposition) let us briefly note the views of outstanding philosophers of the eighteenth century who pursued a different path from Berkeley.
Here are Humeâs arguments. In his An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, in the chapter (XII) on sceptical philosophy, he says:
âIt seems evident, that men are carried, by a natural instinct or prepossession, to repose faith in their senses; and that, without any reasoning, or even almost before the use of reason, we always suppose an external universe, which depends not on our perception, but would exist though we and every sensible creature were absent or annihilated. Even the animal creations are governed by a like opinion, and preserve this belief of external objects, in all their thoughts, designs, and actions. . . . But this universal and primary opinion of all men is soon destroyed by the slightest philosophy, which teaches us, that nothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or perception, and that the senses are only the inlets, through which these images are conveyed, without being able to produce any immediate intercourse between the mind and the object. The table, which we see, seems to diminish, as we remove farther from it: But the real table, which exists independent of us, suffers no alteration: It was, therefore, nothing but its image, which was present to the mind. These are the obvious dictates of reason; and no man, who reflects, ever doubted, that the existences, which we consider, when we say, âthis house,â and âthat treeâ are nothing but perceptions in the mind. . . . By what argument can it be proved, that the perceptions of the mind must be caused by external objects, entirely different from them, though resembling them (if that be possible), and could not arise either from the energy of the mind itself, or from the suggestion of some invisible and unknown spirit, or from some other cause still more unknown to us? . . . How shall the question be determined? By experience surely; as all other questions of a like nature. But here experience is, and must be entirely silent. The mind has never anything present to it but the perceptions, and cannot possibly reach any experience of their connection with objects. This supposition of such a connection is, therefore, without any foundation in reasoning. To have recourse to the veracity of the Supreme Being, in order to prove the veracity of our senses, is surely making a very unexpected circuit . . . if the external world be once called in question, we shall be at a loss to find arguments, by which we may prove the existence of that Being, or any of his attributes.â[4]
He says the same thing in his Treatise of Human Nature (Part IV, Sec. II, âOn Scepticism Towards Sensations"): âOur perceptions are our only objects.â (P. 281 of the French translation by Renouvier and Pillon, 1878.) By scepticism Hume means refusal to explain sensations as the effects of objects, spirit, etc., refusal to reduce perceptions to the external world, on the one hand, and to a deity or to an unknown spirit, on the other. And the author of the introduction to the French translation of Hume, F. Pillonâa philosopher of a trend akin to Mach (as we shall see below)âjustly remarks that for Hume subject and object are reduced to âgroups of various perceptions,â to âelements of consciousness, to impressions, ideas, etc."; that the only concern should be with the âgroupings and combinations of these elements."[5] The English Humean, Huxley, who coined the apt and correct term âagnosticism,â in his book on Hume also emphasises the fact that the latter, regarding âsensationsâ as the âprimary and irreducible states of consciousness,â is not entirely consistent on the question how the origin of sensations is to be explained, whether by the effect of objects on man or by the creative power of the mind. âRealism and idealism are equally probable hypothesesâ (i.e., for Hume).[6] Hume does not go beyond sensations. âThus the colours red and blue, and the odour of a rose, are simple impressions. . . . A red rose gives us a complex impression, capable of resolution into the simple impressions of red colour, rose-scent, and numerous othersâ (op. cit., pp. 64-65). Hume admits both the âmaterialist positionâ and the âidealist positionâ (p. 82); the âcollection of perceptionsâ may be generated by the Fichtean âegoâ or may be a âsignificationâ and even a âsymbolâ of a âreal something.â This is how Huxley interprets Hume.
As for the materialists, here is an opinion of Berkeley given by Diderot, the leader of the Encyclopaedists[11]:
âThose philosophers are called idealists who, being conscious only of their existence and of the sensations which succeed each other within themselves, do not admit anything else. An extravagant system which, to my thinking, only the blind could have originated; a system which, to the shame of human intelligence and philosophy, is the most difficult to combat, although the most absurd of all.â[7]
And Diderot, who came very close to the standpoint of contemporary materialism (that arguments and syllogisms alone do not suffice to refute idealism, and that here it is not a question for theoretical argument), notes the similarity of the premises both of the idealist Berkeley, and the sensationalist Condillac. In his opinion, Condillac should have undertaken a refutation of Berkeley in order to avoid such absurd conclusions being drawn from the treatment of sensations as the only source of our knowledge.
In the âConversation Between dâAlembert and Diderot,â Diderot states his philosophical position thus:
â. . . Suppose a piano to be endowed with the faculty of sensation and memory, tell me, would it not of its own accord repeat those airs which you have played on its keys? We are instruments endowed with sensation and memory. Our senses are so many keys upon which surrounding nature strikes and which often strike upon themselves. And this is all, in my opinion, that occurs in a piano organised like you and me.â
DâAlembert retorts that such an instrument would have to possess the faculty of finding food for itself and of reproducing little pianos. Undoubtedly, contends Diderot.âBut take an egg:
âThis is what refutes all the schools of theology and all the temples on earth. What is this egg? A mass that is insensible until the embryo is introduced thither, and when this embryo is introduced, what is it then? An insensible mass, for in its turn, this embryo is only an inert and crude liquid. How does this mass arrive at a different organisation, arrive at sensibility and life? By means of heat. And what produces heat? Motion. . . .â
The animal that is hatched from the egg is endowed with all your sensations; it performs all your actions.
âWould you maintain with Descartes that this is a simple imitating machine? Little children will laugh at you, and the philosophers will reply that if this be a machine then you too are a machine. If you admit that the difference between these animals and you is only one of organisation, you will prove your common sense and sagacity, you will be right. But from this will follow the conclusion that refutes you; namely, that from inert matter organised in a certain way, impregnated with another bit of inert matter, by heat and motionâsensibility, life, memory, consciousness, emotion, and thought are generated.â
One of the two, continues Diderot, either admit some âhidden elementâ in the egg, that penetrates to it in an unknown way at a certain stage of development, an element about which it is unknown whether it occupies space, whether it is material or whether it is created for the purposeâwhich is contradictory to common sense, and leads to inconsistencies and absurdities; or we must make âa simple supposition which explains everything, namely, that the faculty of sensation is a general property of matter, or a product of its organisation.â To dâAlembertâs objection that such a supposition implies a quality which in its essence is incompatible with matter, Diderot retorts:
âAnd how do you know that the faculty of sensation is essentially incompatible with matter, since you do not know the essence of any thing at all, either of matter, or of sensation? Do you understand the nature of motion any better, its existence in a body, its communication from one body to another?â
DâAlembert:
âWithout knowing the nature of sensation, or that of matter, I see, however, that the faculty of sensation is a simple quality, single, indivisible, and incompatible with a divisible subject or substratum.â
Diderot:
âMetaphysico-theological nonsense! What, do you not see that all qualities of matter, that all its forms accessible to our senses are in their essence indivisible? There cannot be a larger or a smaller degree of impenetrability. There may be half of a round body, but there is no half of roundness. . . . Be a physicist and admit the derivative character of the given effect when you see how it is derived, though you may be unable to explain the relation between the cause and the effect. Be logical and do not replace a cause that exists and explains everything by some other cause which it is impossible to conceive, and the connection of which with the effect is even more difficult to conceive, and which engenders an infinite number of difficulties without solving a single one of them.â
DâAlembert:
âAnd what if I abandon this cause?â
Diderot:
âThere is only one substance in the universe, in men and in animals. A hand-organ is of wood, man of flesh. A finch is of flesh, and a musician is of flesh, but differently organised; but both are of the same origin, of the same formation, have the same functions and the same purpose.â
DâAlembert:
âAnd what establishes the similarity of sounds between your two pianos?â
Diderot:
â. . . The instrument endowed with the faculty of sensation, or the animal, has learned by experience that after a certain sound certain consequences follow outside of it; that other sentient instruments, like itself, or similar animals, approach, recede, demand, offer, wound, caress;âand all these consequences are associated in its memory and in the memory of other animals with the formation of sounds. Mark, in intercourse between people there is nothing beside sounds and actions. And to appreciate all the power of my system, mark again that it is faced with that same insurmountable difficulty which Berkeley adduced against the existence of bodies. There was a moment of insanity when the sentient piano imagined that it was the only piano in the world, and that the whole harmony of the universe resided within it.â [Ibid., Vol. II, pp. 114-18.]
This was written in 1769. And with this we shall conclude our brief historical enquiry. We shall have more than one occasion to meet âthe insane pianoâ and the harmony of the universe residing within man when we come to analyse ârecent positivism.â
For the present we shall confine ourselves to one conclusion: the ârecentâ Machians have not adduced a single argument against the materialists that had not been adduced by Bishop Berkeley.
Let us mention as a curiosity that one of these Machians, Valentinov, vaguely sensing the falsity of his position, has tried to âcover up the tracesâ of his kinship with Berkeley and has done so in a rather amusing manner. On page 150 of his book we read:
â. . . When those who, speaking of Mach, point to Berkeley, we ask, which Berkeley do they mean? Do they mean the Berkeley who traditionally regards himself [Valentinov wishes to say who is regarded] as a solipsist; the Berkeley who defends the immediate presence and providence of the deity? Generally speaking [?], do they mean Berkeley, the philosophising bishop, the destroyer of atheism, or Berkeley, the thoughtful analyser? With Berkeley the solipsist and preacher of religious metaphysics Mach indeed has nothing in common.â
Valentinov is muddled; he was unable to make clear to himself why he was obliged to defend Berkeley the âthoughtful analyserâ and idealist against the materialist Diderot. Diderot drew a clear distinction between the fundamental philosophical trends. Valentinov confuses them, and while doing so very amusingly tries to console us: âWe would not consider the âkinshipâ of Mach to the idealist views of Berkeley a philosophical crime,â he says, âeven if this actually were the caseâ (p. 149). To confound two irreconcilable fundamental trends in philosophyâreally, what âcrimeâ is that? But that is what the whole wisdom of Mach and Avenarius amounts to. We shall now proceed to an examination of this wisdom.

[10] Neo-Kantianismâa reactionary trend in bourgeois philosophy preaching subjective idealism under the slogan of a return to Kantian philosophy. It arose in the middle of the nineteenth century in Germany, where at this time there was an increased interest in Kantianism. In 1865 Otto Liebinannâs book Kant and, the Epigones was published, each chapter ending with the call: âBack to Kantâ. Liebmana put forward the task of correcting Kantâs Drain error "âtue recognition of âthings-in-themselvesâ. âthe revival of Kantianism was helped by the wurks of Kuno Fischer and Eduard Zeller, and one of the early representatives of neo-Kantianism was Friedrich Albert Lange who tried to use physiology as a basis for agnosticism.
Later, two main schools of Neo-Kantianism were formed: that of Marburg (I-icrmann Cohen, Paul Natorp, etc.) and that of Freiburg or Baden (Wilhelm XVindelband, 1-leinrich Riekert, etc). The former tried to substantiate idealism by speculating on the successes of natural science, especially on the penetration of mathematical methods into physics; the latter counterposed the social sciences to natural science, trying to prove that historical phenomena are strictly individual and not subject to the operation of any laws. Both schools put the question of the logical basis of science in place of the fundamental question of philosophy. Criticising Kant âfrom the right ", the neo-Kantians declared the âthing-in-itself" to be a âlimiting conceptâ to which knowledge was tending. Denying the objective existence of the material world, they regarded as the object of knowledge not the laws of nature and society, but merely the phenomena of consciousness In contrast to the agnosticism of the natural scientists, that of the neo Kantians was not âshamefaced materialismâ, for it asserted the impotence of science in regard to cognition and changes of reality. The neo-Kantians openly attacked Marxism, counterposing to it âethical socialismâ. In accordance with their theory of knowled2e they declared socialism to be the âethical idealâ of human social existence, an ideal to which mankind was striving but which it could not attain. This âtheoryâ of the neo-Kantians was seized upon by the revisionists, headed by Eduard Bernstein, who put forward the slogan: âThe movement is everything, the final goal is nothingâ, Neo-Kantianism was one of the philosophical pillars of the Second International. In Russia attempts to "combine neo-Kantianism and Marxism were made by the âlegal Marxistsâ G. V. Plekhanov, Paul Lafargue and Franz Mehring opposed the neo-Kantian revision of  Marxism. Lenin laid bare the reactionary nature of neo-Kantianism and showed its connection with other trends of bourgeois philosophy (immanentism, Machism, pragmatism, etc.). 
[11] The Encyclopaedistsâa group of philosophers natural scientists and publicists of the French Enlightenment hi the eighteenth century who joined in publishing the EncyclopÃ©die ou dictionnaire raisonnÃ© des sciences, des arts et des mÃ©tiers (Encyclopaedia or Esâplanotory Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts and Professions) (1751. 80). It was organised and led by Penis Diderot, whose closest assistant was Jean le Rond d âAlembert. Paul Henri Holbach, Claude Adrien Helvetius and Voltaire actively assisted in publishing the Encyclopaedia and Jean Jacques Rousseau contributed to the first volumes.
[12] Die Neue Zeit (New Times)âthe theoretical magazine of the German Social-Democratic Party, published in Stuttgart, 1883- 1923. Until October 1917 it was edited by Karl Kautsky, after that by Heinrich Currow. Several works by Marx and Engels were published for the first time in Neue Zeit, e.g., K. Marxâs Critiquu of the Gotha Programme, F. Engelsâ Contribution to the Critique of the Social-Democratic Draft Programme of 1891 and others. Engels constantly helped the editors of the magazine by his advice and often criticised it for allowing departures from Marxism to bc published in it. Contributors to Neue Zeit included outstanding leaders of the German and international workersâ movement at the turn of the century: August Bebel. Wilhelm Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemnburg, Franz Mebring, Clara Zetkin, G. V. Plokhanov, Paul Lafargue and others. From the second half of the nineties onwards, after the death of Engels, the magazine began systematically publishing articles by revisionists including a series of articles by Eduard Bernstein, âProblems of Socialismâ, which marked the opening of a campaign of the revisionists against Marxism. During the First World War, the magazine adopted a Centrist position, in effect supporting the social-chauvinists.
The Encyclopaedists were the ideologists of the revolutionary bourgeoisie and they played a decisive part in the ideological preparation for the eighteenth-century bourgeois revolution in France.

Chapter 1.1



Sensations And Complexes Of Sensations
The fundamental premises of the theory of knowledge of Mach and Avenarius are frankly, simply and clearly expounded by them in their early philosophical works. To these works we shall now turn, postponing for later treatment an examination of the corrections and emendations subsequently made by these writers.
Mach wrote in 1872:

âThe task of science can only be:

To determine the laws of connection of ideas (Psychology).
To discover the laws of connection of sensations (Physics).
To explain the laws of connection between sensations and ideas (Psycho-physics).â[1]


This is quite clear.
The subject matter of physics is the connection between sensations and not between things or bodies, of which our sensations are the image. And in 1883, in his Mechanics, Mach repeats the same thought:
âSensations are not âsymbols of things.â The âthingâ is rather a mental symbol for a complex of sensations of relative stability. Not the things (bodies) but colours, sounds, pressures, spaces, times (what we usually call sensations) are the real elements of the world.â[2]
About this word âelements,â the fruit of twelve years of âreflection,â we shall speak later. At present let us note that Mach explicitly states here that things or bodies are complexes of sensations, and that he quite clearly sets up his own philosophical point of view against the opposite theory which holds that sensations are âsymbolsâ of things (it would be more correct to say images or reflections of things). The latter theory is philosophical materialism. For instance, the materialist Frederick Engelsâthe not unknown collaborator of Marx and a founder of Marxismâconstantly and without exception speaks in his works of things and their mental pictures or images (Gedanken-Abbilder), and it is obvious that these mental images arise exclusively from sensations. It would seem that this fundamental standpoint of the âphilosophy of Marxismâ ought to be known to everyone who speaks of it, and especially to anyone who comes out in print in the name of this philosophy. But because of the extraordinary confusion which our Machians have introduced, it becomes necessary to repeat what is generally known. We turn to the first section of Anti-DÃ¼hring and read: â. . . things and their mental images . . .â;[3] or to the first section of the philosophical part, which reads:
âBut whence does thought obtain these principles [i.e., the fundamental principles of all knowledge]? From itself? No . . . these forms can never be created and derived by thought out of itself, but only from the external world . . . the principles are not the starting point of the investigation [as DÃ¼hring who would be a materialist, but cannot consistently adhere to materialism, holds], but its final result; they are not applied to nature and human history, but abstracted from them; it is not nature and the realm of humanity which conform to these principles, but the principles are only valid in so far as they are in conformity with nature and history. That is the only materialistic conception of the matter, and Herr DÃ¼hringâs contrary conception is idealistic, makes things stand completely on their heads, and fashions the real world out of ideasâ (ibid., p. 21).[13]
Engels, we repeat, applies this âonly materialistic conceptionâ everywhere and without exception, relentlessly attacking DÃ¼hring for the least deviation from materialism to idealism. Anybody who reads Anti-DÃ¼hring and Ludwig Feuerbach with the slightest care will find scores of instances when Engels speaks of things and their reflections in the human brain, in our consciousness, thought, etc. Engels does not say that sensations or ideas are âsymbolsâ of things, for consistent materialism must here use âimage,â picture, or reflection instead of âsymbol,â as we shall show in detail in the proper place. But the question here is not of this or that formulation of materialism, but of the opposition of materialism to idealism, of the difference between the two fundamental lines in philosophy. Are we to proceed from things to sensation and thought? Or are we to proceed from thought and sensation to things? The first line, i.e., the materialist line, is adopted by Engels. The second line, i.e., the idealist line, is adopted by Mach. No evasions, no sophisms (a multitude of which we shall yet encounter) can remove the clear and indisputable fact that Ernst Machâs doctrine that things are complexes of sensations is subjective idealism and a simple rehash of Berkeleianism. If bodies are âcomplexes of sensations,â as Mach says, or âcombinations of sensations,â as Berkeley said, it inevitably follows that the whole world is but my idea. Starting from such a premise it is impossible to arrive at the existence of other people besides oneself: it is the purest solipsism. Much as Mach, Avenarius, Petzoldt and the others may abjure solipsism, they cannot in fact escape solipsism without falling into howling logical absurdities. To make this fundamental element of the philosophy of Machism still clearer, we shall give a few additional quotations from Machâs works. Here is a sample from the Analyse der Empfindungen[4]; (I quote from Kotlyarâs Russian translation, published by Skirmunt, Moscow, 1907):
"We see a body with a point S. If we touch S, that is, bring it into contact with our body, we receive a prick. We can see S without feeling the prick. But as soon as we feel the prick we find S on the skin. Thus, the visible point is a permanent nucleus, to which, according to circumstances, the prick is attached as something accidental. By frequent repetitions of analogous occurrences we finally habituate ourselves to regard all properties of bodies as âeffectsâ which proceed from permanent nuclei and are conveyed to the self through the medium of the body; which effects we call sensations . . .â (p. 20).
In other words, people âhabituateâ themselves to adopt the standpoint of materialism, to regard sensations as the result of the action of bodies, things, nature on our sense organs. This âhabit,â so noxious to the philosophical idealists (a habit acquired by all mankind and all natural science!), is not at all to the liking of Mach, and he proceeds to destroy it:
â. . . Thereby, however, these nuclei are deprived of their entire sensible content and are converted into naked abstract symbols . . .â
An old song, most worthy Professor! This is a literal repetition of Berkeley who said that matter is a naked abstract symbol. But it is Ernst Mach, in fact, who goes naked, for if he does not admit that the âsensible contentâ is an objective reality, existing independently of us, there remains only a ânaked abstractâ I, an I infallibly written with a capital letter and italicised, equal to âthe insane piano, which imagined that it was the sole existing thing in this world.â If the âsensible contentâ of our sensations is not the external world then nothing exists save this naked I engaged in empty âphilosophicalâ acrobatics. A stupid and fruitless occupation!
â. . . It is then correct that the world consists only of our sensations. In which case we have knowledge only of sensations, and the assumption of those nuclei, and of their interaction, from which alone sensations proceed, turns out to be quite idle and superfluous. Such a view can only appeal to half-hearted realism or half-hearted criticism.â
We have quoted the sixth paragraph of Machâs âanti-metaphysical observationsâ in full. It is a sheer plagiarism on Berkeley. Not a single idea, not a glimmer of thought, except that âwe sense only our sensations.â From which there is only one possible inference, namely, that the âworld consists only of my sensations.â The word âourâ employed by Mach instead of âmyâ is employed illegitimately. By this word alone Mach betrays that âhalf-heartednessâ of which he accuses others. For if the âassumptionâ of the existence of the external world is âidle,â if the assumption that the needle exists independently of me and that an interaction takes place between my body and the point of the needle is really âidle and superfluous,â then primarily the âassumptionâ of the existence of other people is idle and superfluous. Only I exist, and all other people, as well as the external world, come under the category of idle ânuclei.â Holding this point of view one cannot speak of âourâ sensations; and when Mach does speak of them, it is only a betrayal of his own amazing half-heartedness. It only proves that his philosophy is a jumble of idle and empty words in which their author himself does not believe.
Here is a particularly graphic example of Machâs half heartedness and confusion. In Â§ 6 of Chapter XI of the Analysis of Sensations we read:
âIf I imagine that while I am experiencing sensations, I or someone else could observe my brain with all possible physical and chemical appliances, it would be possible to ascertain with what processes of the organism particular sensations are connected . . . â (p. 197).
Very well! This means, then, that our sensations are connected with definite processes, which take place in the organism in general, and in our brain in particular? Yes, Mach very definitely makes this âassumption"âit would be quite a task not to make it from the standpoint of natural science! But is not this the very âassumptionâ of those very same ânuclei and their interactionâ which our philosopher declared to be idle and superfluous? We are told that bodies are complexes of sensations; to go beyond that, Mach assures us, to regard sensations as a product of the action of bodies upon our sense-organs, is metaphysics, an idle and superfluous assumption, etc., Ã  la Berkeley. But the brain is a body. Consequently, the brain also is no more than a complex of sensations. It follows, then, that with the help of a complex of sensations I (and I also am nothing but a complex of sensations) sense complexes of sensations. A delightful philosophy! First sensations are declared to be âthe real elements of the world"; on this an âoriginalâ Berkeleianism is erectedâand then the very opposite view is smuggled in, viz., that sensations are connected with definite processes in the organism. Are not these âprocessesâ connected with an exchange of matter between the âorganismâ and the external world? Could this exchange of matter take place if the sensations of the particular organism did not give it an objectively correct idea of this external world?
Mach does not ask himself such embarrassing questions when he mechanically jumbles fragments of Berkeleianism with the views of natural science, which instinctively adheres to the materialist theory of knowledge. . . . In the same paragraph Mach writes: âIt is sometimes also asked whether (inorganic) âmatterâ experiences sensation....â Does this mean that there is no doubt that organic matter experiences sensation? Does this mean that sensation is not something primary but that it is one of the properties of matter? Mach skips over all the absurdities of Berkeleianism! . . . âThe question,â he avers, âis natural enough, if we proceed from the current widespread physical notions, according to which matter is the immediate and indisputably given reality, out of which everything, inorganic and organic, is constructed....â Let us bear in mind this truly valuable admission of Machâs that the current widespread physical notions regard matter as the immediate reality, and that only one variety of this reality (organic matter) possesses the well-defined property of sensation. . . . Mach continues:
âThen, indeed, sensation must suddenly arise somewhere in this structure consisting of matter, or else have previously been present in the foundation. From our standpoint the question is a false one. For us matter is not what is primarily given. Rather, what is primarily given are the elements (which in a certain familiar relation are designated as sensations). . . . â
What is primarily given, then, are sensations, although they are âconnectedâ only with definite processes in organic matter! And while uttering such absurdities Mach wants to blame materialism ("the current widespread physical notion") for leaving unanswered the question whence sensation âarises.â This is a sample of the ârefutationâ of materialism by the fideists and their hangers-on. Does any other philosophical standpoint âsolveâ a problem before enough data for its solution has been collected? Does not Mach himself say in the very same paragraph: âSo long as this problem (how far sensation extends in the organic world) has not been solved even in a single special case, no answer to the question is possible.â
The difference between materialism and âMachismâ in this particular question thus consists in the following. Materialism, in full agreement with natural science, takes matter as primary and regards consciousness, thought, sensation as secondary, because in its well-defined form sensation is associated only with the higher forms of matter (organic matter), while âin the foundation of the structure of matterâ one can only surmise the existence of a faculty akin to sensation. Such, for example, is the supposition of the well-known German scientist Ernst Haeckel, the English biologist Lloyd Morgan and others, not to speak of Diderotâs conjecture mentioned above. Machism holds to the opposite, the idealist point of view, and at once lands into an absurdity: since, in the first place, sensation is taken as primary, in spite of the fact that it is associated only with definite processes in matter organised in a definite way; and since, in the second place, the basic premise that bodies are complexes of sensations is violated by the assumption of the existence of other living beings and, in general, of other âcomplexesâ besides the given great I.
The word âelement,â which many naÃ¯ve people (as we shall see) take to be some sort of a new discovery, in reality only obscures the question, for it is a meaningless term which creates the false impression that a solution or a step forward has been achieved. This impression is a false one, because there still remains to be investigated and reinvestigated how matter, apparently entirely devoid of sensation, is related to matter which, though composed of the same atoms (or electrons), is yet endowed with a well-defined faculty of sensation. Materialism clearly formulates the as yet unsolved problem and thereby stimulates the attempt to solve it, to undertake further experimental investigation. Machism, which is a species of muddled idealism, befogs the issue and side tracks it by means of the futile verbal trick, âelement.â
Here is a passage from Machâs latest, comprehensive and conclusive philosophical work that clearly betrays the falsity of this idealist trick. In his Knowledge and Error we read:
âWhile there is no difficulty in constructing (aufzubauen) every physical experience out of sensations, i.e., psychical elements, it is impossible to imagine (ist keine MÃ¶glichkeit abzusehen) how any psychical experience can be composed (darstellen) of the elements employed in modern physics, i.e., mass and motion (in their rigidityâStarrheitâwhich is serviceable only for this special science).â[5]
Of the rigidity of the conceptions of many modern scientists and of their metaphysical (in the Marxist sense of the term, i.e., anti-dialectical) views, Engels speaks repeatedly and very precisely. We shall see later that it was just on this point that Mach went astray, because he did not understand or did not know the relation between relativism and dialectics. But this is not what concerns us here. It is important for us here to note how glaringly Machâs idealism emerges, in spite of the confusedâostensibly newâterminology. There is no difficulty, you see, in constructing any physical element out of sensations, i.e., psychical elements! Oh yes, such constructions, of course, are not difficult, for they are purely verbal constructions, shallow scholasticism, serving as a loophole for fideism. It is not surprising after this that Mach dedicates his works to the immanentists; it is not surprising that the immanentists, who profess the most reactionary kind of philosophical idealism, welcome Mach with open arms. The ârecent positivismâ of Ernst Mach was only about two hundred years too late. Berkeley had already sufficiently shown that âout of sensations, i.e., psychical elements,â nothing can be âbuiltâ except solipsism. As regards materialism, against which Mach here, too, sets up his own views, without frankly and explicitly naming the âenemy,â we have already seen in the case of Diderot what the real views of the materialists are. These views do not consist in deriving sensation from the movement of matter or in reducing sensation to the movement of matter, but in recognising sensation as one of the properties of matter in motion. On this question Engels shared the standpoint of Diderot. Engels dissociated himself from the âvulgarâ materialists, Vogt, BÃ¼chner and Moleschott, for the very reason, among others, that they erred in believing that the brain secretes thought in the same way as the liver secretes bile. But Mach, who constantly sets up his views in opposition to materialism, ignores, of course, all the great materialistsâDiderot, Feuerbach, Marx and Engelsâjust as all other official professors of official philosophy do.
In order to characterise Avenariusâ earliest and basic view, let us take his first independent philosophical work, Philosophy as a Conception of the World According to the Principle of the Minimum Expenditure of Effort. Prolegomena to a Critique of Pure Experience, which appeared in 1876. Bogdanov in his Empirio-Monism (Bk. I, 2nd ed., 1905, p. 9, note) says that âin the development of Machâs views, the starting point was philosophical idealism, while a realistic tinge was characteristic of Avenarius from the very beginning.â Bogdanov said so because he believed what Mach said (see Analysis of Sensations, Russian translation, p. 288). Bogdanov should not have believed Mach, and his assertion is diametrically opposed to the truth. On the contrary, Avenariusâ idealism emerges so clearly in his work of 1876 that Avenarius himself in 1891 was obliged to admit it. In the introduction to The Human Concept of the World Avenarius says: âHe who has read my first systematic work, Philosophie, etc., will at once have presumed that I would have attempted to treat the problems of a criticism of pure experience from the âidealistâ standpointâ (Der menschliche Weltbegriff, 1891, Vorwort, S. ix [The Human Concept of the World, 1891, Foreword, p. ix]), but âthe sterility of philosophical idealism compelled me to doubt the correctness of my previous pathâ (p. x). This idealist starting point of Avenariusâ is universally acknowledged in philosophical literature. Of the French writers I shall refer to Cauwelaert, who says that Avenariusâ philosophical standpoint in the Prolegomena is âmonistic idealism.â[6] Of the German writers, I shall name Rudolf Willy, Avenariusâ disciple, who says that âAvenarius in his youthâand particularly in his work of 1876âwas totally under the spell (ganz im Banne) of so-called epistemological idealism.â[7]
And, indeed, it would be ridiculous to deny the idealism in Avenariusâ Prolegomena, where he explicitly states that âonly sensation can be thought of as the existingâ (pp. 10 and 65 of the second German edition; all italics in quotations are ours). This is how Avenarius himself presents the contents of Â§ 116 of his work. Here is the paragraph in full:
âWe have recognised that the existing (das Seiende) is substance endowed with sensation; the substance falls away [it is âmore economical,â donât you see, there is âa lesser expenditure of effortâ in thinking that there is no âsubstanceâ and that no external world exists!], sensation remains; we must then regard the existing as sensation, at the basis of which there is nothing which does not possess sensation (nichts Empfindungsloses).â
Sensation, then, exists without âsubstance,â i.e., thought exists without brain! Are there really philosophers capable of defending this brainless philosophy? There are! Professor Richard Avenarius is one of them. And we must pause for a while to consider this defence, difficult though it be for a normal person to take it seriously. Here, in Â§Â§ 89 and 90 of this same work, is Avenariusâ argument:

â. . . The proposition that motion produces sensation is based on apparent experience only. This experience, which includes the act of perception, consists, presumably, in the fact that sensation is generated in a certain kind of substance (brain) as a result of transmitted motion (excitation) and with the help of other material conditions (e.g., blood). Howeverâapart from the fact that such generation has never itself (selbst) been observedâin order to construct the supposed experience, as an experience which is real in all its component parts, empirical proof, at least, is required to show that sensation, which assumedly is caused in a certain substance by transmitted motion, did not already exist in that substance in one way or another; so that the appearance of sensation cannot be conceived of in any other way than as a creative act on the part of the transmitted motion. Thus only by proving that where a sensation now appears there was none previously, not even a minimal one, would it be possible to establish a fact which, denoting as it does some act of creation, contradicts all the rest of experience and radically changes all the rest of our conception of nature (Naturanschauung). But such proof is not furnished by any experience, and cannot be furnished by any experience; on the contrary, the notion of a state of a substance totally devoid of sensation which subsequently begins to experience sensation is only a hypothesis. But this hypothesis merely complicates and obscures our understanding instead of simplifying and clarifying it.
Should the so-called experience, viz., that the sensation is caused by a transmitted motion in a substance that begins to perceive from this moment, prove upon closer examination to be only apparent, there still remains sufficient material in the content of the experience to ascertain at least the relative origin of sensation from conditions of motion, namely, to ascertain that the sensation which is present, although latent or minimal, or for some other reason not manifest to the consciousness, becomes, owing to transmitted motion, released or enhanced or made manifest to the consciousness. However, even this bit of the remaining content of experience is only an appearance. Were we even by an ideal observation to trace the motion proceeding from the moving substance A, transmitted through a series of intermediate centres and reaching the substance B, which is endowed with sensation, we should at best find that sensation in substance B is developed or becomes enhanced simultaneously with the reception of the incoming motionâbut we should not find that this occurred as a consequence of the motion. . . .â

We have purposely quoted this refutation of materialism by Avenarius in full, in order that the reader may see to what truly pitiful sophistries ârecentâ empirio-critical philosophy resorts. We shall compare with the argument of the idealist Avenarius the materialist argument of Bogdanov, if only to punish Bogdanov for his betrayal of materialism!
In long bygone days, fully nine years ago, when Bogdanov was half âa natural-historical materialistâ (that is, an adherent of the materialist theory of knowledge, to which the overwhelming majority of contemporary scientists instinctively hold), when he was only half led astray by the muddled Ostwald, he wrote:
âFrom ancient times to the present day, descriptive psychology has adhered to the classification of the facts of consciousness into three categories: the domain of sensations and ideas, the domain of emotions and the domain of impulses. . . . To the first category belong the images of phenomena of the outer or inner world, as taken by themselves in consciousness. . . . Such an image is called a âsensationâ if it is directly produced through the sense-organs by its corresponding external phenomenon.â[8]
And a little farther on he says: âSensation . . . arises in consciousness as a result of a certain impulse from the external environment transmitted by the external sense-organsâ (p. 222). And further: âSensation is the foundation of mental life; it is its immediate connection with the external worldâ (p. 240). âAt each step in the process of sensation a transformation of the energy of external excitation into a state of consciousness takes placeâ (p. 133). And even in 1905 when with the gracious assistance of Ostwald and Mach, Bogdanov had already abandoned the materialist standpoint in philosophy for the idealist standpoint, he wrote (from forgetfulness!) in his Empirio-Monism:
âAs is known, the energy of external excitation, transformed at the nerve-ends into a âtelegraphicâ form of nerve current (still insufficiently investigated but devoid of all mysticism), first reaches the neurons that are located in the so-called âlowerâ centresâganglial, cerebro-spinal, subcortical, etc.â (Bk. I, 2nd ed., 1905, p. 118.)
For every scientist who has not been led astray by professorial philosophy, as well as for every materialist, sensation is indeed the direct connection between consciousness and the external world; it is the transformation of the energy of external excitation into a state of consciousness. This transformation has been, and is, observed by each of us a million times on every hand. The sophism of idealist philosophy consists in the fact that it regards sensation as being not the connection between consciousness and the external world, but a fence, a wall, separating consciousness from the external worldânot an image of the external phenomenon corresponding to the sensation, but as the âsole entity.â Avenarius gave but a slightly changed form to this old sophism, which had been already worn threadbare by Bishop Berkeley. Since we do not yet know all the conditions of the connection we are constantly observing between sensation and matter organised in a definite way, let us therefore acknowledge the existence of sensation aloneâthat is what the sophism of Avenarius reduces itself to.
To conclude our description of the fundamental idealist premises of empirio-criticism, we shall briefly refer to the English and French representatives of this philosophical trend. Mach explicitly says of Karl Pearson, the Englishman, that he (Mach) is âin agreement with his epistemological (erkenntniskritischen) views on all essential pointsâ (Mechanik, ed. previously cited, p. ix). Pearson in turn agrees with Mach.[9] For Pearson âreal thingsâ are âsense-impressions.â He declares the recognition of things outside the boundaries of sense impressions to be metaphysics. Pearson fights materialism with great determination (although he does not know Feuerbach, or Marx and Engels); his arguments do not differ from those analysed above. However, the desire to masquerade as a materialist is so foreign to Pearson (that is a specialty of the Russian Machians), Pearson is soâincautious, that he invents no ânewâ names for his philosophy and simply declares that his views and those of Mach are âidealistâ (ibid., p. 326)! He traces his genealogy directly to Berkeley and Hume. The philosophy of Pearson, as we shall repeatedly find, is distinguished from that of Mach by its far greater integrity and consistency.
Mach explicitly declares his solidarity with the French physicists, Pierre Duhem and Henri PoincarÃ©[10]. We shall have occasion to deal with the particularly confused and inconsistent philosophical views of these writers in the chapter on the new physics. Here we shall content ourselves with noting that for PoincarÃ© things are âgroups of sensationsâ[11] and that a similar view is casually expressed by Duhem.[12]
We shall now proceed to examine how Mach and Avenarius, having admitted the idealist character of their original views, corrected them in their subsequent works.

Chapter 1.2



âThe Discovery of the World-Elementsâ
Such is the title under which Friedrich Adler, lecturer at the University of ZÃ¼rich, probably the only German author also anxious to supplement Marx with Machism, writes of Mach.[1] And this naÃ¯ve university lecturer must be given his due: in his simplicity of heart he does Machism more harm than good. At least, he puts the question point-blankâdid Mach really âdiscover the world-elements"? If so, then, only very backward and ignorant people, of course, can still remain materialists. Or is this discovery a return on the part of Mach to the old philosophical errors?
We saw that Mach in 1872 and Avenarius in 1876 held a purely idealist view; for them the world is our sensation. In 1883 Machâs Mechanik appeared, and in the preface to the first edition Mach refers to Avenariusâ Prolegomena, and greets his ideas as being âvery closeâ (sehr verwandte) to his own philosophy. Here are the arguments in the Mechanik concerning the elements:
âAll natural science can only picture and represent (nachbilden und vorbilden) complexes of those elements which we ordinarily call sensations. It is a matter of the connection of these elements. . . The connection of A (heat) with B (flame) is a problem of physics, that of A and N (nerves) a problem of physiology. Neither exists separately; both exist in conjunction. Only temporarily can we neglect either. Even processes that are apparently purely mechanical, are thus always physiologicalâ (op. cit., German ed., p. 498).
We find the same in the Analysis of Sensations:
âWherever . . . the terms âsensation,â âcomplex of sensations,â are used alongside of or in place of the terms âelement,â âcomplex of elements,â it must be borne in mind that it is only in this connection [namely, in the connection of A, B, C with K, L, M, that is, in the connection of âcomplexes which we ordinarily call bodiesâ with âthe complex which we call our bodyâ] and relation, only in this functional dependence that the elements are sensations. In another functional dependence they are at the same time physical objectsâ (Russian translation, pp. 23 and 17).
âA colour is a physical object when we consider its dependence, for instance, upon the source of illumination (other colours, temperatures, spaces and so forth). When we, however, consider its dependence upon the retina (the elements K, L, M), it is a psychological object, a sensationâ (ibid., p. 24).
Thus the discovery of the world-elements amounts to this:

all that exists is declared to be sensation,
sensations are called elements,
elements are divided into the physical and the psychical; the latter is that which depends on the human nerves and the human organism generally; the former does not depend on them;
the connection of physical elements and the connection of psychical elements, it is declared, do not exist separately from each other; they exist only in conjunction;
it is possible only temporarily to leave one or the other connection out of account;
the ânewâ theory is declared to be free from âone-sidedness.â[2]

Indeed, it is not one-sidedness we have here, but an in coherent jumble of antithetical philosophical points of view. Since you base yourself only on sensations you do not correct the âone-sidednessâ of your idealism by the term âelement,â but only confuse the issue and cravenly hide from your own theory. In a word, you eliminate the antithesis between the physical and psychical,[3] between materialism (which regards nature, matter, as primary) and idealism (which regards spirit, mind, sensation as primary); indeed, you promptly restore this antithesis; you restore it surreptitiously, retreating from your own fundamental premise! For, if elements are sensations, you have no right even for a moment to accept the existence of âelementsâ independently of my nerves and my mind. But if you do admit physical objects that are independent of my nerves and my sensations and that cause sensation only by acting upon my retinaâyou are disgracefully abandoning your âone-sidedâ idealism and adopting the standpoint of âone-sidedâ materialism! If colour is a sensation only depending upon the retina (as natural science compels you to admit), then light rays, falling upon the retina, produce the sensation of colour. This means that outside us, independently of us and of our minds, there exists a movement of matter, let us say of ether waves of a definite length and of a definite velocity, which, acting upon the retina, produce in man the sensation of a particular colour. This is precisely how natural science regards it. It explains the sensations of various colours by the various lengths of light-waves existing outside the human retina, outside man and independently of him. This is materialism: matter acting upon our sense-organs produces sensation. Sensation depends on the brain, nerves, retina, etc., i.e., on matter organised in a definite way. The existence of matter does not depend on sensation. Matter is primary. Sensation, thought, consciousness are the supreme product of matter organised in a particular way. Such are the views of materialism in general, and of Marx and Engels in particular. Mach and Avenarius secretly smuggle in materialism by means of the word âelement,â which supposedly frees their theory of the âone-sidednessâ of subjective idealism, supposedly permits the assumption that the mental is dependent on the retina, nerves and so forth, and the assumption that the physical is independent of the human organism. In fact, of course, the trick with the word âelementâ is a wretched sophistry, for a materialist who reads Mach and Avenarius will immediately ask: what are the âelements"? It would, indeed, be childish to think that one can dispose of the fundamental philosophical trends by inventing a new word. Either the âelementâ is a sensation, as all empirio-criticists, Mach, Avenarius, Petzoldt,[4] etc., maintainâin which case your philosophy, gentlemen, is idealism vainly seeking to hide the nakedness of its solipsism under the cloak of a more âobjectiveâ terminology; or the âelementâ is not a sensationâin which case absolutely no thought whatever is attached to the ânewâ term; it is merely an empty bauble.
Take Petzoldt, for instance, the last word in empirio-criticism, as V. Lesevich, the first and most outstanding Russian empirio-criticist describes him.[5] Having defined elements as sensations, he says in the second volume of the work mentioned:
âIn the statement that âsensations are the elements of the worldâ one must guard against taking the term âsensationâ as denoting something only subjective and therefore ethereal, transforming the ordinary picture of the world into an illusion (VerflÃ¼chtigendes).â[6]
One speaks of what hurts one most! Petzoldt feels that the world âevaporatesâ (verflÃ¼chtigt sich), or becomes transformed into an illusion, when sensations are regarded as world-elements. And the good Petzoldt imagines that he helps matters by the reservation that sensation must not be taken as something only subjective! Is this not a ridiculous sophistry? Does it make any difference whether we âtakeâ sensation as sensation or whether we try to stretch the meaning of the term? Does this do away with the fact that sensations in man are connected with normally functioning nerves, retina, brain, etc., that the external world exists independently of our sensations? If you are not trying to evade the issue by a subterfuge, if you are really in earnest in wanting to âguardâ against subjectivism and solipsism, you must above all guard against the fundamental idealist premises of your philosophy; you must replace the idealist line of your philosophy (from sensations to the external world) by the materialist line (from the external world to sensations); you must abandon that empty and muddled verbal embellishment, âelement,â and simply say that colour is the result of the action of a physical object on the retina, which is the same as saying that sensation is a result of the action of matter on our sense-organs.
Let us take Avenarius. The most valuable material on the question of the âelementsâ is to be found in his last work (and, it might be said, the most important for the comprehension of his philosophy), Notes on the Concept of the Subject of Psychology.[7] The author, by the way, here gives a very âgraphicâ table (Vol. XVIII, p. 410), the main part of which we reproduce here:


Things, or the substantial
Elements, complexes of elements: Corporeal things


Thoughts, or the mental
Incorporeal things, recollections and fantasies


Compare this with what Mach says after all his elucidation of the âelementsâ (Analysis of Sensations, p. 33): âIt is not bodies that produce sensations, but complexes of elements (complexes of sensations) that make up bodies.â Here you have the âdiscovery of the world-elementsâ that overcomes the one-sidedness of idealism and materialism! At first we are assured that the âelementsâ are something new, both physical and psychical at the same time; then a little correction is surreptitiously inserted: instead of the crude, materialist differentiation of matter (bodies, things) and the psychical (sensations, recollections, fantasies) we are presented with the doctrine of ârecent positivismâ regarding elements substantial and elements mental. Adler (Fritz) did not gain very much from âthe discovery of the world-elements"!
Bogdanov, arguing against Plekhanov in 1906, wrote:
â. . . I cannot own myself a Machian in philosophy. In the general philosophical conception there is only one thing I borrowed from Machâthe idea of the neutrality of the elements of experience in relation to the âphysicalâ and âpsychicalâ and the dependence of these characteristics solely on the connection of experience.â (Empirio-Monism, Bk. III, St. Petersburg, 1906, p. xli.)
This is as though a religious man were to sayâI cannot own myself a believer in religion, for there is âonly one thingâ I have borrowed from the believersâthe belief in God. This âonly one thingâ which Bogdanov borrowed from Mach is the basic error of Machism, the basic falsity of its entire philosophy. Those deviations of Bogdanovâs from empirio-criticism to which he himself attaches great significance are in fact of entirely secondary importance and amount to nothing more than inconsiderable private and individual differences between the various empirio-criticists who are approved by Mach and who approve Mach (we shall speak of this in greater detail later). Hence when Bogdanov was annoyed at being confused with the Machians he only revealed his failure to understand what radically distinguishes materialism from what is common to Bogdanov and to all other Machians. How Bogdanov developed, improved or worsened Machism is not important What is important is that he has abandoned the materialist standpoint and has thereby inevitably condemned himself to confusion and idealist aberrations.
In 1899, as we saw, Bogdanov had the correct standpoint when he wrote: âThe image of the man before me, directly given to me by vision, is a sensation.â[8] Bogdanov did not trouble to give a criticism of this earlier position of his. He blindly believed Mach and began to repeat after him that the âelementsâ of experience are neutral in relation to the physical and psychical. âAs has been established by recent positivist philosophy,â wrote Bogdanov in Book I of Empirio-Monism (2nd ed., p. 90), âthe elements of psychical experience are identical with the elements of experience in general, as they are identical with the elements of physical experience.â Or in 1906 (Bk. III, p. xx): âas to âidealism,â can it be called idealism merely on the grounds that the elements of âphysical experienceâ are regarded as identical with the elements of âpsychical experience,â or with elementary sensationsâwhen this is simply an indubitable fact?â
Here we have the true source of all Bogdanovâs philosophical misadventures, a source which he shares with the rest of the Machians. We can and must call it idealism when âthe elements of physical experienceâ (i.e., the physical, the external world, matter) are regarded as identical with sensations, for this is sheer Berkeleianism. There is not a trace here of recent philosophy, or positivist philosophy, or of indubitable fact. It is merely an old, old idealist sophism. And were one to ask Bogdanov how he would prove the âindubitable factâ that the physical is identical with sensations, one would get no other argument save the eternal refrain of the idealists: I am aware only of my sensations; the âtestimony of self-consciousnessâ (die Aussage des Selbstbewusstseins) of Avenarius in his Prolegomena (2nd German ed., Â§ 93, p. 56); or: âin our experience [which testifies that âwe are sentient substanceâ] sensation is given us with more certainty than is substantialityâ (ibid., Â§ 91, p. 55), and so on and so forth. Bogdanov (trusting Mach) accepted a reactionary philosophical trick as an âindubitable fact.â For, indeed, not a single fact was or could be cited which would refute the view that sensation is an image of the external worldâa view which was shared by Bogdanov in 1899 and which is shared by natural science to this day. In his philosophical wanderings the physicist Mach has completely strayed from the path of âmodern science.â Regarding this important circumstance, which Bogdanov overlooked, we shall have much to say later.
One of the circumstances which helped Bogdanov to jump so quickly from the materialism of the natural scientists to the muddled idealism of Mach was (apart from the influence of Ostwald) Avenariusâ doctrine of the dependent and independent series of experience. Bogdanov himself expounds the matter in Book I of his Empirio-Monism thus:
âIn so far as the data of experience appear in dependence upon the state of the particular nervous system, they form the psychical world of the particular person, in so far as the data of experience are taken outside of such a dependence, we have before us the physical world. Avenarius therefore characterises these two realms of experience respectively as the dependent series and the independent series of experienceâ (p. 18).
That is just the whole trouble, the doctrine of the independent (i.e., independent of human sensation) âseriesâ is a surreptitious importation of materialism, which, from the standpoint of a philosophy that maintains that bodies are complexes of sensations, that sensations are âidenticalâ with physical âelements,â is illegitimate, arbitrary, and eclectic. For once you have recognised that the source of light and light-waves exists independently of man and the human consciousness, that colour is dependent on the action of these waves upon the retina, you have in fact adopted the materialist standpoint and have completely destroyed all the âindubitable factsâ of idealism, together with all âthe complexes of sensations,â the elements discovered by recent positivism, and similar nonsense.
That is just the whole trouble. Bogdanov (like the rest of the Russian Machians) has never looked into the idealist views originally held by Mach and Avenarius, has never understood their fundamental idealist premises, and has therefore failed to discover the illegitimacy and eclecticism of their subsequent attempts to smuggle in materialism surreptitiously. Yet, just as the initial idealism of Mach and Avenarius is generally acknowledged in philosophical literature, so is it generally acknowledged that subsequently empirio-criticism endeavoured to swing towards materialism. Cauwelaert, the French writer quoted above, asserts that Avenariusâ Prolegomena is âmonistic idealism,â The Critique of Pure Experience[9] (1888â90) is âabsolute realism,â while The Human Concept of the World (1891) is an attempt âto explainâ the change. Let us note that the term realism is here employed as the antithesis of idealism. Following Engels, I use only the term materialism in this sense, and consider it the sole correct terminology, especially since the term ârealismâ has been bedraggled by the positivists and the other muddleheads who oscillate between materialism and idealism. For the present it will suffice to note that Cauwelaert had the indisputable fact in mind that in the Prolegomena (1876) sensation, according to Avenarius, is the only entity, while âsubstance"âin accordance with the principle of âthe economy of thought"!âis eliminated, and that in the Critique of Pure Experience the physical is taken as the independent series, while the psychical and, consequently, sensations, are taken as the dependent series.
Avenariusâ disciple Rudolf Willy likewise admits that Avenarius was a âcompleteâ idealist in 1876, but subsequently âreconciledâ (Ausgleich) ânaÃ¯ve realismâ (i.e., the instinctive, unconscious materialist standpoint adopted by humanity, which regards the external world as existing independently of our minds) with this teaching (loc. cit.).
Oskar Ewald, the author of the book Avenarius as the Founder of Empirio-Criticism, says that this philosophy combines contradictory idealist and ârealistâ (he should have said materialist) elements (not in Machâs sense, but in the human sense of the term element). For example, âthe absolute [method of consideration] would perpetuate naÃ¯ve realism, the relative would declare exclusive idealism as permanent."[10] Avenarius calls the absolute method of consideration that which corresponds to Machâs connection of âelementsâ outside our body, and the relative that which corresponds to Machâs connection of âelementsâ dependent on our body.
But of particular interest to us in this respect is the opinion of Wundt, who himself, like the majority of the above mentioned writers, adheres to the confused idealist standpoint, but who has analysed empirio-criticism perhaps more attentively than all the others. p. Yushkevich has the following to say in this connection: âIt is interesting to note that Wundt regards empirio-criticism as the most scientific form of the latest type of materialism,â[11] i.e., the type of those materialists who regard the spiritual as a function of corporeal processes (and whomâwe would addâWundt defines as standing midway between Spinozism[19] and absolute materialism[12]).
True, this opinion of Wundtâs is extremely interesting. But what is even more âinterestingâ is Mr. Yushkevichâs attitude towards the books and articles on philosophy of which he treats. This is a typical example of the attitude of our Machians to such matters. Gogolâs Petrushka[20] used to read and find it interesting that letters always combined to make words. Mr. Yushkevich read Wundt and found it âinterestingâ that Wundt accused Avenarius of materialism. If Wundt is wrong, why not refute him? If he is right, why not explain the antithesis between materialism and empirio-criticism? Mr. Yushkevich finds what the idealist Wundt says âinteresting,â but this Machian regards it as a waste of effort to endeavour to go to the root of the matter (probably on the principle of âthe economy of thoughtâ). . .
The point is that by informing the reader that Wundt accuses Avenarius of materialism, and by not informing him that Wundt regards some aspects of empirio-criticism as materialism and others as idealism and holds that the connection between the two is artificial, Yushkevich entirely distorted the matter. Either this gentleman absolutely does not understand what he reads, or he was prompted by a desire to indulge in false self-praise with the help of Wundt, as if to say: you see, the official professors regard us, too, as materialists, and not as muddleheads.
The above-mentioned article by Wundt constitutes a large book (more than 300 pages), devoted to a detailed analysis first of the immanentist school, and then of the empirio-criticists. Why did Wundt connect these two schools? Because he considers them closely akin ; and this opinion, which is shared by Mach, Avenarius, Petzoldt and the immanentists is, as we shall see later, entirely correct. Wundt shows in the first part of this article that the immanentists are idealists, subjectivists and adherents of fideism. This, too, as we shall see later, is a perfectly correct opinion, although Wundt expounds it with a superfluous ballast of professorial erudition, with superfluous niceties and reservations, which is to be explained by the fact that Wundt himself is an idealist and fideist. He reproaches the immanentists not because they are idealists and adherents of fideism, but because, in his opinion, they arrive at these great principles by incorrect methods. Further, the second and third parts of Wundtâs article are devoted to empirio-criticism. There he quite definitely points out that very important theoretical propositions of empirio-criticism (e.g., the interpretation of âexperienceâ and the âprincipal co-ordination,â of which we shall speak later) are identical with those held by the immanentists (die empiriokritische in Uebereinstimmung mit der immanenten Philosophie annimmt, S. 382). Other of Avenariusâ theoretical propositions are borrowed from materialism, and in general empirio-criticism is a âmotleyâ (bunte Mischung, ibid., S. 57), in which the âvarious component elements are entirely heterogeneousâ (an sich einander vÃ¶llig heterogen sind, S. 56).
Wundt regards Avenariusâ doctrine of the âindependent vital series,â in particular, as one of the materialist morsels of the Avenarius-Mach hotchpotch. If you start from the âsystem Câ (that is how Avenariusâwho was very fond of making erudite play of new termsâdesignates the human brain or the nervous system in general), and if the mental is for you a function of the brain, then this âsystem Câ is a âmetaphysical substance"âsays Wundt (ibid., p. 64), and your doctrine is materialism. It should be said that many idealists and all agnostics (Kantians and Humeans included) call the materialists metaphysicians, because it seems to them that to recognise the existence of an external world independent of the human mind is to transcend the bounds of experience. Of this terminology and its utter incorrectness from the point of view of Marxism, we shall speak in its proper place. Here it is important to note that the recognition of the âindependentâ series by Avenarius (and also by Mach, who expresses the same idea in different words) is, according to the general opinion of philosophers of various parties, i.e., of various trends in philosophy, an appropriation from materialism. If you assume that everything that exists is sensation, or that bodies are complexes of sensations, you cannot, without violating all your fundamental premises, all âyourâ philosophy, arrive at the conclusion that the physical exists independently of our minds, and that sensation is a function of matter organised in a definite way. Mach and Avenarius, in their philosophy, combine fundamental idealist premises with individual materialist deductions for the very reason that their theory is an example of that âpauperâs broth of eclecticismâ[21] of which Engels speaks with just contempt.[13]
This eclecticism is particularly marked in Machâs latest philosophical work, Knowledge and Error, 2nd edition, 1906. We have already seen that Mach there declared that âthere is no difficulty in constructing every physical element out of sensation, i.e., out of psychical elements,â and in the same book we read: âDependencies outside the boundary U [ = Umgrenzung, i.e., âthe spatial boundary of our body,â S. 8] are physics in the broadest senseâ (S. 323, Â§ 4). âTo obtain those dependencies in a pure state (rein erhalten) it is necessary as much as possible to eliminate the influence of the observer, that is, of those elements that lie within Uâ (loc. cit.). Well, well, the titmouse first promised to set the sea on fire. . . i.e., to construct physical elements from psychical elements, and then it turns out that physical elements lie beyond the boundary of psychical elements, âwhich lie within our bodyâ! A remarkable philosophy!
Another example:
âA perfect (vollkommenes) gas, a perfect liquid, a perfect elastic body, does not exist; the physicist knows that his fictions only approximate to the facts and arbitrarily simplify them; he is aware of the divergence, which cannot be eliminatedâ (S. 418, Â§ 30).
What divergence (Abweichung) is meant here? The divergence of what from what? Of thought (physical theory) from the facts. And what are thoughts, ideas? Ideas are the âtracks of sensationsâ (S. 9). And what are facts? Facts are âcomplexes of sensations.â And so, the divergence of the tracks of sensations from complexes of sensations cannot be eliminated.
What does this mean? It means that Mach forgets his own theory and, when treating of various problems of physics, speaks plainly, without idealist twists, i.e., materialistically. All the âcomplexes of sensationsâ and the entire stock of Berkeleian wisdom vanish. The physicistsâ theory proves to be a reflection of bodies, liquids, gases existing outside us and independently of us, a reflection which is, of course, approximate; but to call this approximation or simplification âarbitraryâ is wrong. In fact, sensation is here regarded by Mach just as it is regarded by all science which has not been âpurifiedâ by the disciples of Berkeley and Hume, viz., as an image of the external world. Machâs own theory is subjective idealism; but when the factor of objectivity is required, Mach unceremoniously inserts into his arguments the premises of the contrary, i.e., the materialist, theory of knowledge. Eduard von Hartmann, a consistent idealist and consistent reactionary in philosophy, who sympathises with the Machiansâ fight against materialism, comes very close to the truth when he says that Machâs philosophical position is a âmixture (Nichtunterscheidung) of naÃ¯ve realism and absolute illusionismâ.[14] That is true. The doctrine that bodies are complexes of sensations, etc., is absolute illusionism, i.e., solipsism; for from this standpoint the world is nothing but my illusion. On the other hand, Machâs afore-mentioned argument, as well as many other of his fragmentary arguments, is what is known as ânaÃ¯ve realism,â i.e., the materialist theory of knowledge unconsciously and instinctively taken over from the scientists.
Avenarius and the professors who follow in his footsteps attempt to disguise this mixture by the theory of the âprincipal co-ordination.â We shall proceed to examine this theory presently, but let us first finish with the charge that Avenarius is a materialist. Mr. Yushkevich, to whom Wundtâs opinion which he failed to understand seemed so interesting, was either himself not enough interested to learn, or else did not condescend to inform the reader, how Avenariusâ nearest disciples and successors reacted to this charge. Yet this is necessary to clarify the matter if we are interested in the relation of Marxâs philosophy, i.e., materialism, to the philosophy of empirio-criticism. Moreover, if Machism is a muddle, a mixture of materialism and idealism, it is important to know whither this current turnedâif we may so express itâafter the official idealists began to disown it because of its concessions to materialism.
Wundt was answered, among others, by two of Avenariusâ purest and most orthodox disciples, J. Petzoldt and Fr. Carstanjen. Petzoldt, with haughty resentment, repudiated the charge of materialism, which is so degrading to a German professor, and in support referred toâwhat do you think?âAvenariusâ Prolegomena, where, supposedly, the concept of substance has been annihilated! A convenient theory, indeed, that can be made to embrace both purely idealist works and arbitrarily assumed materialist premises! Avenariusâ Critique of Pure Experience, of course, does not contradict this teaching, i.e., materialism, writes Petzoldt, but neither does it contradict the directly opposite spiritualist doctrine.[15] An excellent defence! This is exactly what Engels called âa pauperâs broth of eclecticism.â Bogdanov, who refuses to own himself a Machian and who wants to be considered a Marxist (in philosophy), follows Petzoldt. He asserts that âempirio-criticism is not . . . concerned with materialism, or with spiritualism, or with metaphysics in general,â[16] that âtruth . . . does not lie in the âgolden meanâ between the conflicting trends [materialism and spiritualism], but lies out side of both".[17] What appeared to Bogdanov to be truth is, as a matter of fact, confusion, a wavering between materialism and idealism.
Carstanjen, rebutting Wundt, said that he absolutely repudiated this âimportation (Unterschiebung) of a materialist elementâ which is utterly foreign to the critique of pure experience.â.[18] âEmpirio-criticism is scepticism ÏÎ±Î¹ ÎµÏÎ¿ÏÎ·Î½ (pre-eminently) in relation to the content of the concepts.â There is a grain of truth in this insistent emphasis on the neutrality of Machism; the amendment made by Mach and Avenarius to their original idealism amounts to partial concessions to materialism. Instead of the consistent standpoint of Berkeleyâthe external world is my sensationâwe some times get the Humean standpointâI exclude the question whether or not there is anything beyond my sensations. And this agnostic standpoint inevitably condemns one to vacillate between materialism and idealism.

The essence of substance is expressed in innumerable qualitiesâattributes, the most important of which are extension and thought. Spinoza regarded causality as a form of the interconnection of the separate phenomena of nature, understanding by it the immediate reciprocal action of bodies whose first cause is substance. The action of all modes of substance, including man, is strictly one of necessity; the notion of accident arises only in consequence of ignorance of the totality of all the acting causes. Since hought is one of the attributes of universal substance, the connection and order of ideas are in principle the same as the order and connection of things, and the possibility of human knowledge of the world is unlimited. For the same reason, of the hree forms of cognitionâsensuous, rational and rational-intuitiveâ-the last is regarded as the most rustworthy, in which âa thing is perceived singly through its essence or through knowledge of its immediate causeâ (B. Spinoza, ractatus de intellectus emendatione, et de via, qua optime veram, rerum cognitionem dirigitur). This method enables man both to know his own passions and to become master over them; manâs freedom consists in knowing the necessity of nature and of he passions of his soul.
Spinozism was not only a form of materialism, but also of atheism, since it rejected ideas of god as a supernatural being who had created the world and rules it. At the same time, by identifying god and nature he made a concession to heology. This retreat, as also the mechanical character of Spinozaâs materialism, was due, on the one hand, to the level of knowledge at that epoch and, on the other hand, to the limited progressive nature of the young Dutch bourgeoisie, whose interests were expressed by Spinozaâs philosophy. Subsequently, a sharp ideological struggle, which has continued to the present day, developed round the philosophical legacy of the great Dutch thinker, Idealist philosophy, by taking advantage of the inevitable historical limitations of Spinozaâs views, distorts the materialist essence of Spinozism, which was an important stage in the development of he materialist world out look.

Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy


Chapter 1.3



The Principal Co-Ordination and âNaive Realismâ
Avenariusâ doctrine of the principal co-ordination is expounded in The Human Concept of the World and in the Notes. The second was written later, and in it Avenarius emphasises that he is expounding, it is true in a somewhat altered form, something that is not different from the Critique of Pure Experience and The Human Concept of the World, but exactly the same (Notes, 1894, S. 137 in the journal quoted above). The essence of this doctrine is the thesis of âthe indissoluble (unauflÃ¶sliche) co-ordination [i.e., the correlative connection] of the self and the environmentâ (p. 146). âExpressed philosophically,â Avenarius says here, one can say the âself and not-self.â We âalways find togetherâ (immer ein Zusammen-vorgefundenes) the one and the other, the self and the environment. âNo full description of what we find (des Vorgefundenem) can contain an âenvironmentâ without some self (ohne ein Ich) whose environment it is, even though it be only the self that is describing what is found (das Vorgefundene)â (p. 146). The self is called the central term of the co-ordination, the environment the counter-term (Gegenglied). (Cf. Der menschliche Weltbegriff, 2. Auflage, 1905, S. 83-84, Â§ 148 ff.)
Avenarius claims that by this doctrine he recognises the full value of what is known as naÃ¯ve realism, that is, the ordinary, non-philosophical, naÃ¯ve view which is entertained by all people who do not trouble themselves as to whether they themselves exist and whether the environment, the external world, exists. Expressing his solidarity with Avenarius, Mach also tries to represent himself as a defender of ânaÃ¯ve realismâ (Analysis of Sensations, p. 39). The Russian Machians, without exception, believed Machâs and Avenariusâ claim that this was indeed a defence of ânaÃ¯ve realism": the self is acknowledged, the environment is acknowledgedâwhat more do you want?
In order to decide who actually possesses the greatest degree of naÃ¯vetÃ©, let us proceed from a somewhat remote starting point. Here is a popular dialogue between a certain philosopher and his reader:

Reader: The existence of a system of things [according to ordinary philosophy] is required and from them only is consciousness to be derived.
Author: Now you are speaking in the spirit of a professional philosopher . . . and not according to human common sense and actual consciousness. . . .
Tell me, and reflect well before you answer: Does a thing appear in you and become present in you and for you otherwise than simultaneously with and through your consciousness of the thing? . . .
Reader: Upon sufficient reflection, I must grant you this.
Author: Now you are speaking from yourself, from your heart. Take care, therefore, not to jump out of yourself and to apprehend anything otherwise than you are able to apprehend it, as consciousness and [the italics are the philosopherâs] the thing, the thing and consciousness; or, more precisely, neither the one nor the other, but that which only subsequently becomes resolved into the two, that which is the absolute subjective-objective and objective-subjective.

Here you have the whole essence of the empirio-critical principal co-ordination, the latest defence of ânaÃ¯ve realismâ by the latest positivism! The idea of âindissolubleâ co-ordination is here stated very clearly and as though it were a genuine defence of the point of view of the common man, undistorted by the subtleties of âthe professional philosophers.â But, as a matter of fact, this dialogue is taken from the work of a classical representative of subjective idealism, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, published in 1801.[1]
There is nothing but a paraphrase of subjective idealism in the teachings of Mach and Avenarius we are examining. The claim that they have risen above materialism and idealism, that they have eliminated the opposition between the point of view that proceeds from the thing to consciousness and the contrary point of viewâis but the empty claim of a renovated Fichteanism. Fichte too imagined that he had âindissolublyâ connected the âselfâ and the âenvironment,â the consciousness and the thing; that he had âsolvedâ the problem by the assertion that a man cannot jump out of himself. In other words, the Berkeleian argument is repeated: I perceive only my sensations, I have no right to assume âobjects in themselvesâ outside of my sensation. The different methods of expression used by Berkeley in 1710, by Fichte in 1801, and by Avenarius in 1891-94 do not in the least change the essence of the matter, viz., the fundamental philosophical line of subjective idealism. The world is my sensation; the non-self is âpostulatedâ (is created, produced) by the self; the thing is indissolubly connected with the consciousness; the indissoluble co-ordination of the self and the environment is the empirio-critical principal co-ordination;âthis is all one and the same proposition, the same old trash with a slightly refurbished, or repainted, signboard.
The reference to ânaÃ¯ve realism,â supposedly defended by this philosophy, is sophistry of the cheapest kind. The ânaÃ¯ve realismâ of any healthy person who has not been an inmate of a lunatic asylum or a pupil of the idealist philosophers consists in the view that things, the environment, the world, exist independently of our sensation, of our consciousness, of our self and of man in general. The same experience (not in the Machian sense, but in the human sense of the term) that has produced in us the firm conviction that independently of us there exist other people, and not mere complexes of my sensations of high, short, yellow, hard, etc.âthis same experience produces in us the conviction that things, the world, the environment exist independently of us. Our sensation, our consciousness is only an image of the external world, and it is obvious that an image cannot exist without the thing imaged, and that the latter exists independently of that which images it. Materialism deliberately makes the ânaÃ¯veâ belief of mankind the foundation of its theory of knowledge.
Is not the foregoing evaluation of the âprincipal co-ordinationâ a product of the materialist prejudice against Machism? Not at all. Specialists in philosophy who cannot be accused of partiality towards materialism, who even detest it and who accept one or other of the idealist systems, agree that the principal co-ordination of Avenarius and Co. is subjective idealism. Wundt, for instance, whose interesting opinion was not understood by Mr. Yushkevich, explicitly states that Avenariusâ theory, according to which a full description of the given or the found is impossible without some self, an observer or describer, is âa false confusion of the content of real experience with reflections about it.â Natural science, says Wundt, completely abstracts from every observer.
âSuch abstraction is possible only because the attribution (Hinzudenken) of an experiencing individual to every content of experience, which the empirio-critical philosophy, in agreement with the immanentist philosophy, assumes, is in general an empirically unfounded assumption arising from a false confusion of the content of real experience with reflections about itâ (loc. cit., p. 382).
For the immanentists (Schuppe, Rehmke, Leclair, Schubert-Soldern), who themselves voiceâas we shall see laterâtheir hearty sympathy with Avenarius, proceed from this very idea of the âindissolubleâ connection between subject and object. And W. Wundt, before analysing Avenarius, demonstrated in detail that the immanentist philosophy is only a âmodificationâ of Berkeleianism that however much the immanentists may deny their kinship with Berkeley we should not allow verbal differences to conceal from us the âdeeper content of these philosophical doctrines,â viz., Berkeleianism or Fichteanism.[2]
The English writer Norman Smith, analysing Avenariusâ Philosophy of Pure Experience, puts this criticism in an even more straightforward and emphatic form:
"Most readers of Avenariusâ The Human Concept of the World will probably agree that, however convincing as criticism [of idealism], it is tantalisingly illusive in its positive teaching. So long as we seek to interpret his theory of experience in the form in which it is avowedly presented, namely, as genuinely realistic, it eludes all clear comprehension: its whole meaning seems to be exhausted in negation of the subjectivism which it overthrows. It is only when we translate Avenariusâ technical terms into more familiar language that we discover where the real source of the mystification lies. Avenarius has diverted attention from the defects of his position by directing his main attack against the very weakness [i.e., of the idealist position] which is fatal to his own theory.â[3]
âThroughout the whole discussion the vagueness of the term experience stands him in good stead. Sometimes it means experiencing and at other times the experienced, the latter meaning being emphasised when the nature of the self is in question. These two meanings of the term experience practically coincide with his important distinction between the absolute and the relative standpoints [I have examined above what significance this distinction has for Avenarius]; and these two points of view are not in his philosophy really reconciled. For when he allows as legitimate the demand that experience be ideally completed in thought [the full description of the environment is ideally completed by thinking of an observing self], he makes an admission which he cannot successfully combine with his assertion that nothing exists save in relation to the self. The ideal completion of given reality which results from the analysis of material bodies into elements which no human senses can apprehend [here are meant the material elements discovered by natural science, the atoms, electrons, etc., and not the fictitious elements invented by Mach and Avenarius], or from following the earth back to a time when no human being existed upon it, is, strictly, not a completion of experience but only of what is experienced. It completes only one of the two aspects which Avenarius has asserted to be inseparable. It leads us not only to what has not been experienced but to what can never by any possibility be experienced by beings like ourselves. But here again the ambiguities of the term experience come to Avenariusâ rescue. He argues that thought is as genuine a form of experience as sense-perception, and so in the end falls back on the time-worn argument of subjective idealism, that thought and reality are inseparable, because reality can only be conceived in thought, and thought involves the presence of the thinker. Not, therefore, any original and profound re-establishment of realism, but only the restatement in its crudest form of the familiar position of subjective idealism is the final outcome of Avenariusâ positive speculationsâ (p. 29).
The mystification wrought by Avenarius, who completely duplicates Fichteâs error, is here excellently exposed. The much-vaunted elimination of the antithesis between materialism (Norman Smith should not have used the term realism) and idealism by means of the term âexperienceâ instantly proves to be a myth as soon as we proceed to definite and concrete problems. Such, for instance, is the problem of the existence of the earth prior to man, prior to any sentient being. We shall presently speak of this point in detail. Here we will note that not only Norman Smith, an opponent of his theory, but also W. Schuppe, the immanentist, who warmly greeted the appearance of The Human Concept of the World as a confirmation of naÃ¯ve realism[4] unmasks Avenarius and his fictitious ârealism.â The fact of the matter is that Schuppe fully agrees with such ârealism,â i.e., the mystification of materialism dished out by Avenarius. Such ârealism,â he wrote to Avenarius, I, the immanentist philosopher, who have been slandered as a subjective idealist, have always claimed with as much right as yourself, hochverehrter Herr Kollege. "My conception of thought . . . excellently harmonises (vertrÃ¤gt sich vortrefflich) with your âTheory of pure experienceââ (p. 384). âThe connection and inseparability of the two terms of the co-ordinationâ are in fact provided only by the self (das Ich, the abstract, Fichtean self-consciousness, thought divorced from the brain). âThat which you desired to eliminate you have tacitly assumed"âso Schuppe wrote to Avenarius (p. 388). And it is difficult to say who more rudely unmasks Avenarius the mystifierâSmith by his straightforward and clear refutation, or Schuppe by his enthusiastic opinion of Avenariusâ crowning work. The kiss of Wilhelm Schuppe in philosophy is no better than the kiss of Peter Struve or Menshikov[6] in politics.
O. Ewald, who praises Mach for not succumbing to materialism, speaks of the principal co-ordination in a similar manner:
âIf one declares the correlation of central term and counter-term to be an epistemological necessity which cannot be avoided, then, even though the word âempirio-criticismâ be inscribed on the signboard in shrieking letters, one is adopting a standpoint that differs in no way from absolute idealism. [The term is incorrect; he should have said subjective idealism, for Hegelâs absolute idealism is reconcilable with the existence of the earth, nature, and the physical universe without man, since nature is regarded as the âothernessâ of the absolute idea.] On the other hand, if we do not hold fast to this co-ordination and grant the counter-terms their independence, then the way is at once opened for every metaphysical possibility, especially in the direction of transcendental realismâ (op. cit., pp. 56-57).
By metaphysics and transcendental realism, Herr FriedlÃ¤nder, who is disguised under the pseudonym Ewald, means materialism. Himself professing one of the varieties of idealism, he fully agrees with the Machians and the Kantians that materialism is metaphysicsâ"from beginning to end the wildest metaphysicsâ (p. 134). On the question of the âtranscendenceâ and the metaphysical character of materialism he is in agreement with Bazarov and all our Machians, and of this we shall have occasion to say more later. Here again it is important to note how in fact the shallow and pedantic claim to have transcended idealism and materialism vanishes, and how the question arises inexorably and irreconcilably. âTo grant the counter-terms their independenceâ means (if one translates the pretentious language of the affected Avenarius into common parlance) to regard nature and the external world as independent of human consciousness and sensation. And that is materialism. To build a theory of knowledge on the hypothesis of the indissoluble connection between the object and human sensation ("complexes of sensationsâ as identical with bodies; âworld-elementsâ that are identical both psychically and physically; Avenariusâ co-ordination, and so forth) is to land inevitably into idealism. Such is the simple and unavoidable truth that with a little attention may be easily detected beneath the piles of affected quasi-erudite terminology of Avenarius, Schuppe, Ewald and the others, which deliberately obscures matters and frightens the general public away from philosophy.
The âreconciliationâ of Avenariusâ theory with ânaÃ¯ve realismâ in the end aroused misgivings even among his own disciples. For instance, R. Willy says that the common assertion that Avenarius came to adopt ânaÃ¯ve realismâ should be taken cum grano salis.â âAs a dogma, naÃ¯ve realism would be nothing but the belief in things-in-themselves existing outside man (ausserpersÃ¶nliche) in their perceptible form."[5] In other words, the only theory of knowledge that is really created by an actual and not fictitious agreement with ânaÃ¯ve realismâ is, according to Willy, materialism! And Willy, of course, rejects materialism. But he is compelled to admit that Avenarius in The Human Concept of the World restores the unity of âexperience,â the unity of the âselfâ and the environment âby means of a series of complicated and extremely artificial subsidiary and intermediary conceptionsâ (p. 171). The Human Concept of the World, being a reaction against the original idealism of Avenarius, âentirely bears the character of a reconciliation (eines Ausgleiches) between the naÃ¯ve realism of common sense and the epistemological idealism of school philosophy. But that such a reconciliation could restore the unity and integrity of experience [Willy calls it Grunderfahrung, that is, basic experienceâanother new world!], I would not assertâ (p. 170).
A valuable admission! Avenariusâ âexperienceâ failed to reconcile idealism and materialism. Willy, it seems, repudiates the school philosophy of experience in order to replace it by a philosophy of âbasicâ experience, which is confusion thrice confounded....

Chapter 1.4



Did Nature Exist Prior to Man?
We have already seen that this question is particularly repugnant to the philosophy of Mach and Avenarius. Natural science positively asserts that the earth once existed in such a state that no man or any other creature existed or could have existed on it. Organic matter is a later phenomenon, the fruit of a long evolution. It follows that there was no sentient matter, no âcomplexes of sensations,â no self that was supposedly âindissolublyâ connected with the environment in accordance with Avenariusâ doctrine. Matter is primary, and thought, consciousness, sensation are products of a very high development. Such is the materialist theory of knowledge, to which natural science instinctively subscribes.
The question arises, have the eminent representatives of empirio-criticism observed this contradiction between their theory and natural science? They have observed it, and they have definitely asked themselves by what arguments this contradiction can be removed. Three attitudes to this question are of particular interest from the point of view of materialism, that of Avenarius himself and those of his disciples J. Petzoldt and R. Willy.
Avenarius tries to eliminate the contradiction to natural science by means of the theory of the âpotentialâ central term in the co-ordination. As we know, co-ordination is the âindissolubleâ connection between self and environment. In order to eliminate the obvious absurdity of this theory the concept of the âpotentialâ central term is introduced. For instance, what about manâs development from the embryo? Does the environment (the âcounter-term") exist if the âcentral termâ is represented by an embryo? The embryonic system CâAvenarius repliesâis the âpotential central term in relation to the future individual environmentâ . The potential central term is never equal to zero, even when there are as yet no parents (elterliche Bestandteile), but only the âintegral parts of the environmentâ capable of becoming parents (p. 141).
The co-ordination then is indissoluble. It is essential for the empirio-criticist to assert this in order to save the fundamentals of his philosophyâsensations and their complexes. Man is the central term of this co-ordination. But when there is no man, when he has not yet been born, the central term is nevertheless not equal to zero; it has only become a potential central term ! It is astonishing that there are people who can take seriously a philosopher who advances such arguments! Even Wundt, who stipulates that he is not an enemy of every form of metaphysics (i.e., of fideism), was compelled to admit âthe mystical obscuration of the concept experienceâ by the word âpotential,â which destroys coordination entirely (op. cit., p. 379).
And, indeed, how can one seriously speak of a co-ordination the indissolubility of which consists in one of its terms being potential?
Is this not mysticism, the very antechamber of fideism? If it is possible to think of the potential central term in relation to a future environment, why not think of it in relation to a past environment, that is, after manâs death ? You will say that Avenarius did not draw this conclusion from his theory? Granted, but that absurd and reactionary theory became the more cowardly but not any the better for that. Avenarius, in 1894, did not carry this theory to its logical conclusion, or perhaps feared to do so. But R. Schubert Soldern, as we shall see, resorted in 1896 to this very theory to arrive at theological conclusions, which in 1906 earned the approval of Mach, who said that Schubert-Soldern was following âvery close pathsâ (to Machism). (Analysis of Sensations, p. 4.) Engels was quite right in attacking DÃ¼hring, an avowed atheist, for inconsistently leaving loopholes for fideism in his philosophy. Engels several times. and justly, brought this accusation against the materialist DÃ¼hring, although the latter had not drawn any theological conclusions, in the âseventies at least. But we have among us people who would have us regard them as Marxists, yet who bring to the masses a philosophy which comes very close to fideism.
Avenarius wrote in the Bemerkungen:
â. . . It would seem that from the empirio-critical standpoint natural science is not entitled to enquire about periods of our present environment which in time preceded the existence of manâ (S. 144).
Avenarius answers:
âThe enquirer cannot avoid mentally projecting himself (sich hinzuzudenken, i.e., imagining one self to be present) . . . for what the scientist wants (although he may not be clearly aware of it) is essentially only this: how is the earth to be defined prior to the appearance of living beings or man if I were mentally to project myself in the role of a spectatorâin much the same way as though it were thinkable that we could from our earth follow the history of another star or of another solar system with the help of perfected instruments.â
An object cannot exist independently of our consciousness. âWe always mentally project ourselves as the intelligence endeavouring to apprehend the object.â
This theory of the necessity of âmentally projectingâ the human mind to every object and to nature prior to man is given by me in the first paragraph in the words of the ârecent positivist,â R. Avenarius, and in the second, in the words of the subjective idealist, J. G. Fichte.[1] The sophistry of this theory is so manifest that it is embarrassing to analyse it. If we âmentally projectâ ourselves, our presence will be imaginaryâbut the existence of the earth prior to man is real. Man could not in practice be an observer, for instance, of the earth in an incandescent state, and to âimagineâ his being present at the time is obscurantism, exactly as though I were to endeavour to prove the existence of hell by the argument that if I âmentally projectedâ myself thither as an observer I could observe hell. The âreconciliationâ of empirio-criticism and natural science amounts to this, that Avenarius graciously consents to âmentally projectâ something the possibility of admitting which is excluded by natural science. No man at all educated or sound-minded doubts that the earth existed at a time when there could not have been any life on it, any sensation or any âcentral term,â and consequently the whole theory of Mach and Avenarius, from which it follows that the earth is a complex of sensations ("bodies are complexes of sensations") or âcomplexes of elements in which the psychical and physical are identical,â or âa counter-term of which the central term can never be equal to zero,â is philosophical obscurantism, the carrying of subjective idealism to absurdity.
J. Petzoldt perceived the absurdity of the position into which Avenarius had fallen and felt ashamed. In his Introduction to the Philosophy of Pure Experience (Vol. II) he devotes a whole paragraph (Â§ 65) âto the question of the reality of earlier (frÃ¼here) periods of the earth.â Petzoldt says:
"In the teaching of Avenarius the self (das Ich) plays a role different from that which it plays with Schuppe [let us note that Petzoldt openly and repeatedly declares: our philosophy was founded by three menâAvenarius, Mach and Schuppe], yet it is a role which, perhaps, possesses too much importance for his theory [Petzoldt was evidently influenced by the fact that Schuppe had unmasked Avenarius by showing that with him too everything rests entirely on the self; and Petzoldt wishes to make a correction] . . . Avenarius said on one occasion that we can think of a âregionâ where no human foot has yet trodden, but to be able to think (italicised by Avenarius) of such an environment there is required what we designate by the term self (Ich-Bezeichnetes), whose (italicised by Avenarius) thought the thinking is (V. f. wiss. Ph., 18. Bd., 1894, S. 146, Anm.).â
Petzoldt replies:
"The epistemologically important question, however, is not whether we can think of such a region at all, but whether we are entitled to think of it as existing, or as having existed, independently of any individual mind.â
What is true, is true! People can think and âmentally projectâ for themselves any kind of hell and any kind of devil. Lunacharsky even âmentally projectedâ for himselfâwell, to use a mild expressionâreligious conceptions.[6] But it is precisely the purpose of the theory of knowledge to show the unreal, fantastic and reactionary character of such projections.
â. . . For, that the system C [i.e., the brain] is necessary for thought is obvious both for Avenarius and for the philosophy which is here presented. . . .â
That is not true. Avenariusâ theory of 1876 is a theory of thought without brain. And in his theory of 1891-94, as we shall presently see, there is a similar element of idealist nonsense.
â. . . But is this system C a condition of existence [italicised by Petzoldt] of, say, the Mesozoic period (SekundÃ¤rzeit) of the earth?â
And Petzoldt, presenting the argument of Avenarius I have already cited on the subject of what science actually wants and how we can âmentally projectâ the spectator, objects:
âNo, we wish to know whether I have the right to think that the earth at that remote epoch existed in the same way as I think of it as having existed yesterday or a minute ago. Or must the existence of the earth be really made conditional, as Willy claimed, on our right at least to assume that at the given period there co-existed some system C, even though at the lowest stage of its development?â
Of this idea of Willyâs we shall speak presently.

âAvenarius evades Willyâs strange conclusion by the argument that the person who puts the question cannot mentally remove himself (sich wegdenken, i.e., think himself as absent), nor can he avoid mentally projecting himself (sich hinzuzudenken, see Avenarius, The Human Concept of the World, 1st Germ. ed., p. 130). But then Avenarius makes the individual self of the person who puts the question, or the thought of such a self, the condition not only of the act of thought regarding the uninhabitable earth, but also of the justification for believing in the existence of the earth at that time.
These false paths are easily avoided if we do not ascribe so much theoretical importance to the self. The only thing the theory of knowledge should demand of the various conceptions of that which is remote in space or time is that it be conceivable and uniquely (eindeutig) determined, the rest is the affair of the special sciencesâ (Vol. II, p. 325).

Petzoldt rechristened the law of causality the law of unique determination and imported into his theory, as we shall see later, the apriority of this law. This means that Petzoldt saves himself from Avenariusâ subjective idealism and solipsism (âhe attributes an exaggerated importance to the self,â as the professorial jargon has it) with the help of Kantian ideas. The absence of the objective factor in Avenariusâ doctrine, the impossibility of reconciling it with the demands of natural science, which declares the earth (object) to have existed long before the appearance of living beings (subject), compelled Petzoldt to resort to causality (unique determination). The earth existed, for its existence prior to man is causally connected with the present existence of the earth. Firstly, where does causality come from? A priori,â[34] says Petzoldt. Secondly, are not the ideas of hell, devils, and Lunacharskyâs âmental projectionsâ also connected by causality? Thirdly, the theory of the âcomplexes of sensationsâ in any case turns out to be destroyed by Petzoldt. Petzoldt failed to resolve the contradiction he observed in Avenarius, and only entangled himself still more, for only one solution is possible, viz., the recognition that the external world reflected by our mind exists independently of our mind. This materialist solution alone is really compatible with natural science, and it alone eliminates both Petzoldtâs and Machâs idealist solution of the question of causality, which we shall speak of separately.
The third empirio-criticist, R. Willy, first raised the question of this difficulty in Avenariusâ philosophy in 1896, in an article entitled âDer Empiriokritizismus als einzig wissenschaftlicher Standpunktâ ("Empirio-Criticism as the Only Scientific Standpoint"). What about the world prior to man?âWilly asks here,[2] and at first answers according to Avenarius: âwe project ourselves mentally into the past.â But then he goes on to say that we are not necessarily obliged to regard experience as human experience. âFor we must simply regard the animal kingdomâbe it the most insignificant wormâas primitive fellow-men (Mitmenschen) if we regard animal life in connection with general experienceâ (pp. 73-74). Thus, prior to man the earth was the âexperienceâ of a worm, which discharged the functions of the âcentral termâ in order to save Avenariusâ âco-ordinationâ and Avenariusâ philosophy! No wonder Petzoldt tried to dissociate himself from an argument which is not only the height of absurdity (ideas of the earth corresponding to the theories of the geologists attributed to a worm), but which does not in any way help our philosopher, for the earth existed not only before man but before any living being generally.
Willy returned to the question in 1905. The worm was now removed.[3] But Petzoldtâs âlaw of unique determinationâ could not, of course, satisfy Willy, who regarded it merely as âlogical formalism.â The author saysâwill not the question of the world prior to man, as Petzoldt puts it, lead us âback again to the things-in-themselves of common sense"? (i.e., to materialism! How terrible indeed!). What does millions of years without life mean?
âIs time perhaps a thing-in-itself? Of course not![4] And that means that things outside men are only impressions, bits of fantasy fabricated by men with the help of a few fragments we find about us. And why not? Need the philosopher fear the stream of life? . . . And so I say to myself: abandon all this love of systems and grasp the moment (ergreife den Augenblick), the moment you are living in, the moment which alone brings happinessâ (pp. 177-78).
Well, well! Either materialism or solipsismâthis, in spite of his vociferous phrases, is what Willy arrives at when he analyses the question of the existence of nature before man.
To summarise. Three augurs of empirio-criticism have appeared before us and have laboured in the sweat of their brow to reconcile their philosophy with natural science, to patch up the holes of solipsism. Avenarius repeated Fichteâs argument and substituted an imaginary world for the real world. Petzoldt withdrew from Fichtean idealism and moved towards Kantian idealism. Willy, having suffered a fiasco with the âworm,â threw up the sponge and inadvertently blurted out the truth: either materialism or solipsism, or even the recognition of nothing but the present moment.
It only remains for us to show the reader how this problem was understood and treated by our own native Machians. Here is Bazarov in the Studies âinâ the Philosophy of Marxism (p. 11):
âIt remains for us now, under the guidance of our faithful vademecum [35] i.e., Plekhanov], to descend into the last and most horrible circle of the solipsist inferno, into that circle where, as Plekhanov assures us, every subjective idealism is menaced with the necessity of conceiving the world as it was contemplated by the ichthyosauruses and archaeopteryxes. âLet us mentally transport ourselves,â writes Plekhanov, âto that epoch when only very remote ancestors of man existed on the earth, for instance, to the Mesozoic period. The question arises, what was the status of space, time and causality then? Whose subjective forms were they then? Were they the subjective forms of the ichthyosauruses? And whose intelligence at that time dictated its laws to nature? The intelligence of the archaeopteryx? To these queries the Kantian philosophy can give no answer. And it must be rejected as absolutely incompatible with modern scienceâ (L. Feuerbach, p. 117).â
Here Bazarov breaks the quotation from Plekhanov just before a very important passageâas we shall soon seeânamely:
âIdealism says that without subject there is no object. The history of the earth shows that the object existed long before the subject appeared, i.e., long before the appearance of organisms possessing a perceptible degree of consciousness. . . . The history of development reveals the truth of materialism.â
We continue the quotation from Bazarov:
â. . . But does Plekhanovâs thing-in-itself provide the desired solution? Let us remember that even according to Plekhanov we can have no idea of things as they are in themselves; we know only their manifestations, only the results of their action on our sense-organs. âApart from this action they possess no aspectâ (L. Feuerbach, p. 112). What sense-organs existed in the period of the ichthyosauruses? Evidently, only the sense-organs of the ichthyosauruses and their like. Only the ideas of the ichthyosauruses were then the actual, the real manifestations of things-in-themselves. Hence, according to Plekhanov also, if the paleontologist desires to remain on ârealâ ground he must write the story of the Mesozoic period in the light of the contemplations of the ichthyosaurus. And, consequently, not a single step forward is made in comparison with solipsism.â
Such is the complete argument (the reader must pardon the lengthy quotationâwe could not avoid it) of a Machian, an argument worthy of perpetuation as a first-class example of muddleheadedness.
Bazarov imagines that Plekhanov gave himself away. If things-in-themselves, apart from their action on our sense organs, have no aspect of their own, then in the Mesozoic period they did not exist except as the âaspectâ of the sense organs of the ichthyosaurus. And this is the argument of a materialist! If an âaspectâ is the result of the action of âthings-in-themselvesâ on sense-organsâdoes it follow that things do not exist independently of sense-organs of one kind or another??
Let us assume for a moment that Bazarov indeed âmisunderstoodâ Plekhanovâs words (improbable as such an assumption may seem), that they did appear obscure to him. Be it so. We ask: is Bazarov engaged in a fencing bout with Plekhanov (whom the Machians exalt to the position of the only representative of materialism!), or is he endeavouring to clear up the problem of materialism ? If Plekhanov seemed obscure to you, or contradictory, and so forth, why did you not turn to other materialists? Is it because you do not know them? But ignorance is no argument.
If Bazarov indeed does not know that the fundamental premise of materialism is the recognition of the external world, of the existence of things outside and independent of our mind, this is truly a striking case of crass ignorance. We would remind the reader of Berkeley, who in 1710 rebuked the materialists for their recognition of âobjects in themselvesâ existing independently of our mind and reflected by our mind. Of course, everybody is free to side with Berkeley or anyone else against the materialists; that is unquestionable. But it is equally unquestionable that to speak of the materialists and distort or ignore the fundamental premise of all materialism is to import preposterous confusion into the problem.
Was Plekhanov right when he said that for idealism there is no object without a subject, while for materialism the object exists independently of the subject and is reflected more or less adequately in the subjectâs mind? If this is wrong, then any man who has the slightest respect for Marxism should have pointed out this error of Plekhanovâs, and should have dealt not with him, but with someone else, with Marx, Engels, or Feuerbach, on the question of materialism and the existence of nature prior to man. But if this is right, or, at least, if you are unable to find an error here, then your attempt to shuffle the cards and to confuse in the readerâs mind the most elementary conception of materialism, as distinguished from idealism, is a literary indecency.
As for the Marxists who are interested in the question apart from every little word uttered by Plekhanov, we shall quote the opinion of L. Feuerbach, who, as is known (perhaps not to Bazarov?), was a materialist, and through whom Marx and Engels, as is well known, came from the idealism of Hegel to their materialist philosophy. In his rejoinder to R. Haym, Feuerbach wrote:
âNature, which is not an object of man or mind, is for speculative philosophy, or at least for idealism, a Kantian thing-in-itself [we shall speak later in detail of the fact that our Machians confuse the Kantian thing-in-itself with the materialist thing-in-itself], an abstraction without reality, but it is nature that causes the downfall of idealism. Natural science, at least in its present state, necessarily leads us back to a point when the conditions for human existence were still absent, when nature, i.e., the earth, was not yet an object of the human eye and mind, when, consequently, nature was an absolutely non-human entity (absolut unmenschliches Wesen). Idealism may retort: but nature also is something thought of by you (von dir gedachte). Certainly, but from this it does not follow that this nature did not at one time actually exist, just as from the fact that Socrates and Plato do not exist for me if I do not think of them, it does not follow that Socrates and Plato did not actually at one time exist without me.â[5]
This is how Feuerbach regarded materialism and idealism from the standpoint of the existence of nature prior to the appearance of man. Avenariusâ sophistry (the âmental projection of the observer") was refuted by Feuerbach, who did not know the ârecent positivismâ but who thoroughly knew the old idealist sophistries. And Bazarov offers us absolutely nothing new, but merely repeats this sophistry of the idealists: âHad I been there [on earth, prior to man], I would have seen the world so-and-soâ (Studies âinâ the Philosophy of Marxism, p. 29). In other words: if I make an assumption that is obviously absurd and contrary to natural science (that man can be an observer in an epoch before man existed), I shall be able to patch up the breach in my philosophy!
This gives us an idea of the extent of Bazarovâs knowledge of the subject and of his literary methods. Bazarov did not even hint at the âdifficultyâ with which Avenarius, Petzoldt and Willy wrestled; and, moreover, he made such a hash of the whole subject, placed before the reader such an incredible hotchpotch, that there ultimately appears to be no difference between materialism and solipsism! Idealism is represented as ârealism,â and to materialism is ascribed the denial of the existence of things outside of their action on the sense-organs! Truly, either Feuerbach did not know the elementary difference between materialism and idealism, or else Bazarov and Co. have completely altered the elementary truths of philosophy.
Or let us take Valentinov, a philosopher who, naturally, is delighted with Bazarov:

âBerkeley is the founder of the correlativist theory of the relativity of subject and objectâ (p. 148). This is not Berkeleian idealism, oh, no! This is a âprofound analysis.â
âIn the most realistic aspect, irrespective of the forms [!] of their usual idealist interpretation [only interpretation!], the fundamental premises of the theory are formulated by Avenariusâ (p. 148). Infants, as we see, are taken in by the mystification!
âAvenariusâ conception of the starting point of knowledge is that each individual finds himself in a definite environment, in other words, the individual and the environment are represented as connected and inseparable [!] terms of one and the same co-ordinationâ (p. 148). Delightful! This is not idealismâBazarov and Valentinov have risen above materialism and idealismâthis âinseparabilityâ of the subject and object is ârealismâ itself.
âIs the reverse assertion correct, namely, that there is no counter-term to which there is no corresponding central termâan individual? Naturally [!] not. . . . In the Archean period the woods were verdant . . . yet there was no manâ (p. 143). That means that the inseparable can be separated! Is that not ânatural"?
âYet from the standpoint of the theory of knowledge, the question of the object in itself is absurdâ (p. 148). Of course! When there were no sentient organisms objects were nevertheless âcomplexes of elementsâ identical with sensations!
âThe immanentist school, in the person of Schubert-Soldern and Schuppe, clad these [!] thoughts in an unsatisfactory form and found itself in the cul-de-sac of solipsismâ (p. 149). But âthese thoughtsâ themselves, of course, contain no solipsism, and empirio-criticism, of course, is not a paraphrase of the reactionary theories of the immanentists, who lie when they declare themselves to be in sympathy with Avenarius!

This, Messrs. Machians, is not philosophy, but an incoherent jumble of words.

Materialism and Empirio-criticism: Chapter 1.5, Does Man Think With The Help of the Brain?



V.I. Lenin
Materialism and Empirio-criticism
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy


Chapter 1.5



Does Man Think With The Help of the Brain?
Bazarov emphatically answers this question in the affirmative. He writes:
âIf Plekhanovâs thesis that âconsciousness is an internal [? Bazarov] state of matterâ be given a more satisfactory form, e.g., that âevery mental process is a function of the cerebral process,â then neither Mach nor Avenarius would dispute itâ (Studies âinâ the Philosophy of Marxism, p. 29).
To the mouse no beast is stronger than the cat. To the Russian Machians there is no materialist stronger than Plekhanov. Was Plekhanov really the only one, or the first, to advance the materialist thesis that consciousness is an internal state of matter? And if Bazarov did not like Plekhanovâs formulation of materialism, why did he take Plekhanov and not Engels or Feuerbach?
Because the Machians are afraid to admit the truth. They are fighting materialism, but pretend that it is only Plekhanov they are fighting. A cowardly and unprincipled method.
But let us turn to empirio-criticism. Avenarius âwould not disputeâ the statement that thought is a function of the brain. These words of Bazarovâs contain a direct untruth. Not only does Avenarius dispute the materialist thesis, but invents a whole âtheoryâ in order to refute it. âThe brain,â says Avenarius in The Human Concept of the World, âis not the habitation, the seat, the creator, it is not the instrument or organ, the supporter or substratum, etc., of thoughtâ (p. 76âapprovingly quoted by Mach in the Analysis of Sensations, p. 32). âThought is not an inhabitant, or commander, or the other half, or side, etc., nor is it a product or even a physiological function, or a state in general of the brainâ (ibid.). And Avenarius expresses himself no less emphatically in his Notes: âpresentationsâ are ânot functions (physiological, psychical, or psycho-physical) of the brainâ (op. cit., Â§ 115, p. 419). Sensations are not âpsychical functions of the brainâ (Â§ 116).
Thus, according to Avenarius, the brain is not the organ of thought, and thought is not a function of the brain. Take Engels, and we immediately find directly contrary, frankly materialist formulations. âThought and consciousness,â says Engels in Anti-DÃ¼hring, âare products of the human brainâ (5th Germ. ed., p. 22).[4] This idea is often repeated in that work. In Ludwig Feuerbach we have the following exposition of the views of Feuerbach and Engels: â. . . the material (stofflich), sensuously perceptible world to which we ourselves belong is the only reality . . . our consciousness and thinking, however suprasensuous they may seem, are the product (Erzeugnis) of a material, bodily organ, the brain. Matter is not a product of mind, but mind itself is merely the highest product of matter. This is, of course, pure materialismâ (4th Germ. ed., p. 18). Or on p. 4, where he speaks of the reflection of the processes of nature in âthe thinking brain,â[5] etc., etc.
Avenarius rejects this materialist standpoint and says that âthe thinking brainâ is a âfetish of natural scienceâ (The Human Concept of the World, 2nd Germ. ed., p. 70). Hence, Avenarius cherishes no illusions concerning his absolute disagreement with natural science on this point. He admits, as do Mach and all the immanentists, that natural science holds an instinctive and unconscious materialist point of view. He admits and explicitly declares that he absolutely differs from the âprevailing psychologyâ (Notes, p. 150, etc.). This prevailing psychology is guilty of an inadmissible âintrojection"âsuch is the new term contrived by our philosopherâi.e., the insertion of thought into the brain, or of sensations into us. These âtwo wordsâ (into usâin uns), Avenarius goes on to say, contain the assumption (Annahme) that empirio-criticism disputes. âThis insertion (Hinein verlegung) of the visible, etc., into man is what we call introjectionâ (Â§ 45, p. 153).
Introjection deviates âin principleâ from the ânatural conception of the worldâ (natÃ¼rlicher Weltbegriff) by substituting âin meâ for âbefore meâ (vor mir, p. 154) âby turning a component part of the (real) environment into a component part of (ideal) thoughtâ (ibid.). âOut of the amechanical [a new word in place of âmentalâ] which manifests itself freely and clearly in the experienced [or, in what is foundâim Vorgefundenen], introjection makes something which hides itself [Latitierendes, says Avenariusâanother new word] mysteriously in the central nervous systemâ (ibid.).
Here we have the same mystification that we encountered in the famous defence of ânaÃ¯ve realismâ by the empirio-criticists and immanentists. Avenarius here acts on the advice of the charlatan in Turgenev[6]: denounce most of all those vices which you yourself possess. Avenarius tries to pretend that he is combating idealism: philosophical idealism, you see, is usually deduced from introjection, the external world is converted into sensation, into idea, and so forth, while I defend ânaÃ¯ve realism,â the equal reality of everything presented, both âselfâ and environment, without inserting the external world into the human brain.
The sophistry here is the same as that which we observed in the case of the famous co-ordination. While distracting the attention of the reader by attacking idealism, Avenarius is in fact defending idealism, albeit in slightly different words: thought is not a function of the brain; the brain is not the organ of thought; sensations are not a function of the nervous system, oh, no! sensations areâ"elements,â psychical only in one connection, while in another connection (although the elements are âidenticalâ) they are physical. With his new and muddled terminology, with his new and pompous epithets, supposedly expressing a new âtheory,â Avenarius merely beat about the bush and returned to his fundamental idealist premise.
And if our Russian Machians (e. c., Bogdanov) failed to notice the âmystificationâ and discerned a refutation of idealism in the ânewâ defence of idealism, in the analysis of empirio-criticism given by the professional philosophers we find a sober estimate of the true nature of Avenariusâ ideas, which is laid bare when stripped of its pretentious terminology.
In 1903 Bogdanov wrote ("Authoritative Thinking,â an article in the symposium From the Psychology of Society, p. 119, et seq.):
âRichard Avenarius presented a most harmonious and complete philosophical picture of the development of the dualism of spirit and body. The gist of his âdoctrine of introjectionâ is the following: [we observe only physical bodies directly, and we infer the experiences of others, i.e., the mind of another person, only by hypothesis]. . . . The hypothesis is complicated by the fact that the experiences of the other person are assumed to be located in his body, are inserted (introjected) into his organism. This is already a superfluous hypothesis and even gives rise to numerous contradictions. Avenarius systematically draws attention to these contradictions by unfolding a series of successive historical facts in the development of dualism and of philosophical idealism. But here we need not follow Avenarius. . . . Introjection serves as an explanation of the dualism of mind and body.â
Bogdanov swallowed the bait of professorial philosophy in believing that âintrojectionâ was aimed against idealism. He accepted the evaluation of introjection given by Avenarius himself at its face value and failed to notice the barb directed against materialism. Introjection denies that thought is a function of the brain, that sensations are a function of manâs central nervous system: that is, it denies the- most elementary truth of physiology in order to destroy materialism. âDualism,â it appears, is refuted idealistically (notwithstanding all Avenariusâ diplomatic rage against idealism), for sensation and thought prove to be not secondary, not a product of matter, but primary. Dualism is here refuted by Avenarius only in so far as he ârefutesâ the existence of the object without the subject, matter without thought, the external world independent of our sensations; that is, it is refuted idealistically. The absurd denial of the fact that the visual image of a tree is a function of the retina, the nerves and the brain, was required by Avenarius in order to bolster up his theory of the âindissolubleâ connection of the âcompleteâ experience, which includes not only the self but also the tree, i.e., the environment.
The doctrine of introjection is a muddle, it smuggles in idealistic rubbish and is contradictory to natural science, which inflexibly holds that thought is a function of the brain, that sensations, i.e., the images of the external world, exist within us, produced by the action of things on our sense-organs. The materialist elimination of the âdualism of mind and bodyâ (i.e., materialist monism) consists in the assertion that the mind does not exist independently of the body, that mind is secondary, a function of the brain, a reflection of the external world. The idealist elimination of the âdualism of mind and bodyâ (i.e., idealist monism) consists in the assertion that mind is not a function of the body, that, consequently, mind is primary, that the âenvironmentâ and the âselfâ exist only in an inseparable connection of one and the same âcomplexes of elements.â Apart from these two diametrically opposed methods of eliminating âthe dualism of mind and body,â there can be no third method, unless it be eclecticism, which is a senseless jumble of materialism and idealism. And it was this jumble of Avenariusâ that seemed to Bogdanov and Co. âthe truth transcending materialism and idealism.â
But the professional philosophers are not as naÃ¯ve and credulous as are the Russian Machians. True, each of these professors-in-ordinary advocates his âownâ system of refuting materialism, or, at any rate, of âreconcilingâ materialism and idealism. But when it comes to a competitor they unceremoniously expose the unconnected fragments of materialism and idealism that are contained in all the ârecentâ and âoriginalâ systems. And if a few young intellectuals swallowed Avenariusâ bait, that old bird Wundt was not to be enticed so easily. The idealist Wundt tore the mask from the poseur Avenarius very unceremoniously when he praised him for the anti-materialist tendency of the theory of introjection. Wundt wrote:
âIf empirio-criticism reproaches vulgar materialism because by such expressions as the brain âhasâ thought, or the brain âproducesâ thought, it expresses a relation which generally cannot be established by factual observation and description [evidently, for Wundt it is a âfactâ that a person thinks without the help of a brain!]. . . this reproach, of course, is well foundedâ (op. cit., S pp. 47-48).
Well, of course! The idealists will always join the half-hearted Avenarius and Mach in attacking materialism! It is only a pity, Wundt goes on to say, that this theory of introjection âdoes not stand in any relation to the doctrine of the independent vital series, and was, to all appearances, only tacked on to it as an afterthought and in a rather artificial fashionâ (p. 365).
Introjection, says O. Ewald, âis to be regarded as nothing but a fiction of empirio-criticism, which the latter requires in order to shield its own fallaciesâ (op. cit., p. 44).
âWe observe a strange contradiction: on the one hand, the elimination of introjection and the restoration of the natural world conception is intended to restore to the world the character of living reality; on the other hand, in the principal co-ordination empirio-criticism is leading to a purely idealist theory of an absolute correlation of the counter-term and the central term. Avenarius is thus moving in a circle. He set out to do battle against idealism but laid down his arms before it came to an open skirmish. He wanted to liberate the world of objects from the yoke of the subject, but again bound that world to the subject. What he has actually destroyed by his criticism is a caricature of idealism rather than its genuine epistemological expressionâ (ibid., pp. 64-65).
"In his [Avenariusâ] frequently quoted statement,â Norman Smith says, âthat the brain is not the seat, organ or supporter of thought, he rejects the only terms which we possess for defining their connectionâ (op. cit., p. 30).
Nor is it surprising that the theory of introjection approved by Wundt excites the sympathy of the outspoken spiritualist, James Ward,[1] who wages systematic war on ânaturalism and agnosticism, and especially on Thomas Huxley (not because he was an insufficiently outspoken and determined materialist, for which Engels reproached him, but) because his agnosticism served in fact to conceal materialism.
Let us note that Karl Pearson, the English Machian, who avoid all philosophical artifices, and who recognises neither introjection, nor co-ordination, nor yet âthe discovery of the world-elements,â arrives at the inevitable outcome of Machism when it is stripped of such âdisguises,â namely, pure subjective idealism. Pearson knows no âelements"; âsense impressionsâ are his alpha and omega. He never doubts that man thinks with the help of the brain. And the contradiction between this thesis (which alone conforms with science) and the basis of his philosophy remains naked and obvious. Pearson spares no effort in combating the concept that matter exists independently of our sense-impressions (The Grammar of Science, Chap VII). Repeating all Berkeleyâs arguments, Pearson declare that matter is a nonentity. But when he comes to speak of the relation of the brain to thought, Pearson emphatically declares: âFrom will and consciousness associated with material machinery we can infer nothing whatever as to will and consciousness without that machinery.â[2] He even advances the following thesis as a summary of his investigations in this field:
âConsciousness has no meaning beyond nervous systems akin to our own; it is illogical to assert that all matter is conscious [but it is logical to assert that all matter possesses a property which is essentially akin to sensation, the property of reflection], still more that consciousness or will can exist outside matterâ (ibid., p. 75, 2nd thesis).
Pearsonâs muddle is glaring! Matter is nothing but groups of sense impressions. That is his premise, that is his philosophy. Hence, sensation and thought should be primary; matter, secondary. But no, consciousness without matter does not exist, and apparently not even without a nervous system! That is, consciousness and sensation are secondary. The waters rest on the earth, the earth rests on a whale, and the whale rests on the waters. Machâs âelementsâ and Avenariusâ co-ordination and introjection do not clear up this muddle, all they do is to obscure the matter, to cover up traces with the help of an erudite philosophical gibberish.
Just such gibberish, and of this a word or two will suffice, is the special terminology of Avenarius, who coined a plenitude of diverse ânotals,â âsecurals,â âfidentials,â etc., etc. Our Russian Machians for the most part shamefacedly avoid this professorial rigmarole, and only now and again bombard the reader (in order to stun him) with an âexistentialâ and such like. But if naÃ¯ve people take these words for a species of bio-mechanics, the German philosophers, who are themselves lovers of âeruditeâ words, laugh at Avenarius. To say ânotalâ (notus = known), or to say that this or the other thing is known to me, is absolutely one and the same, says Wundt in the section entitled âScholastic Character of the Empirio-Critical System.â And, indeed, it is the purest and most dreary scholasticism. One of Avenariusâ most faithful disciples, R. Willy, had the courage to admit it frankly. He says:
âAvenarius dreamed of a bio-mechanics but an understanding of the life of the brain can be arrived at only by actual discoveries, and not by the way in which Avenarius attempted to arrive at it. Avenariusâ bio-mechanics is not grounded on any new observations whatever; its characteristic feature is purely schematic constructions of concepts, and, indeed, constructions that do not even bear the nature of hypotheses that open up new vistas, but rather of stereotyped speculations (blosse Spekulierschablonen), which, like a wall, conceal our view.â[3]
The Russian Machians will soon be like fashion-lovers who are moved to ecstasy over a hat which has already been discarded by the bourgeois philosophers of Europe.

Materialism and Empirio-criticism: Chapter 1.6, The Solipsism of Mach and Avenarius



V.I. Lenin
Materialism and Empirio-criticism
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy


Chapter 1.6



The Solipsism of Mach and Avenarius
We have seen that the starting point and the fundamental premise of the philosophy of empirio-criticism is subjective idealism. The world is our sensationâthis is the fundamental premise, which is obscured but in no wise altered by the word âelementâ and by the theories of the âindependent series,â âco-ordination,â and âintrojection.â The absurdity of this philosophy lies in the fact that it leads to solipsism, to the recognition of the existence of the philosophising individual only. But our Russian Machians assure their readers that to âchargeâ Mach âwith idealism and even solipsismâ is âextreme subjectivism.â So says Bogdanov in the introduction to the Russian translation of Analysis of Sensations (p. xi), and the whole Machian troop repeat it in a great variety of keys.
Having examined the methods whereby Mach and Avenarius disguise their solipsism, we have now to add only one thing: the âextreme subjectivismâ of assertion lies entirely with Bogdanov and Co.; for in philosophical literature writers of the most varied trends have long since disclosed the fundamental sin of Machism beneath all its disguises. We shall confine ourselves to a mere summary of opinions which sufficiently indicate the âsubjectiveâ ignorance of our Machians. Let us note in passing that nearly every professional philosopher sympathises with one or another brand of idealism: in their eyes idealism is not a reproach, as it is with us Marxists; but they point out Machâs actual philosophical trend and oppose one system of idealism by another system, also idealist, but to them more consistent.
O. Ewald, in the book devoted to an analysis of Avenariusâ teachings, writes:
âThe creator of empirio-criticism commits himself volens nolens to solipsismâ (loc. cit., pp. 61-62).
Hans Kleinpeter, a disciple of Mach with whom Mach in his preface to Erkenntnis und Irrtum explicitly declares his solidarity, says:
âIt is precisely Mach who is an example of the compatibility of epistemological idealism with the demands of natural science [for the eclectic everything is âcompatible"!], and of the fact that the latter can very well start from solipsism without stopping thereâ (Archiv fÃ¼r systematische Philosophie,[3] Bd. VI, 1900, S. 87).
E. Lucka, analysing Machâs Analysis of Sensations, says:
âApart from this . . . misunderstandings (MissverstÃ¤ndnis) Mach adopts the ground of pure idealism. . . . It is incomprehensible that Mach denies that he is a Berkeleianâ (Kantstudien,[4] Bd. VIII, 1903, S. 416-17).
W. Jerusalem, a most reactionary Kantian with whom Mach in the above-mentioned preface expresses his solidarity ("a closer kinshipâ of thought than Mach had previously suspectedâVorwort zu âErkenntnis und Irrtum,â S. x, 1906) says: âConsistent phenomenalism leads to solipsism.â And therefore one must borrow a little from Kant! (See Der kritische Idealismus und die reine Logik [Critical Idealism and Pure Logic], 1905, S. 26.)
R. HÃ¶nigswald says:
â. . . the immanentists and the empirio-criticists face the alternative of solipsism or metaphysics in the spirit of Fichte, Schelling, or Hegelâ (Ueber die Lehre Humeâs von der RealitÃ¤t der Aussendinge [Humeâs Doctrine of the Reality of the External World], 1904, S. 68).
The English physicist Oliver Lodge, in his book denouncing the materialist Haeckel, speaks in passing, as though of something generally known, of âsolipsists such as Mach and Karl Pearsonâ (Sir Oliver Lodge, La vie et la matiÃ¨re [Life and Matter], Paris, 1907, p. 15).
Nature,[5] the organ of the English scientists, through the mouth of the geometrician E. T. Dixon, pronounced a very definite opinion of the Machian Pearson, one worth quoting, not because it is new, but because the Russian Machians have naÃ¯vely accepted Machâs philosophical muddle as the âphilosophy of natural scienceâ (A. Bogdanov, introduction to Analysis of Sensations, p. xii, et seq). Dixon writes:
âThe foundation of the whole book, is the proposition that since we cannot directly apprehend anything but sense-impressions, therefore the things we commonly speak of as objective, or external to ourselves, and their variations, are nothing but groups of sense-impressions and sequences of such groups. But Professor Pearson admits the existence of other consciousness than his own, not only by implication in addressing his book to them, but explicitly in many passages.â
Pearson infers the existence of the consciousness of others by analogy, by observing the bodily motions of other people; but since the consciousness of others is real, the existence of people outside myself must be granted!
âOf course it would be impossible thus to refute a consistent idealist, who maintained that not only external things but all other consciousness were unreal and existed only in his imagination, but to recognise the reality of other consciousness is to recognise the reality of the means by which we become aware of them, which . . . is the external aspect of menâs bodies.â
The way out of the difficulty is to recognise the âhypothesisâ that to our sense-impressions there corresponds an objective reality outside of us. This hypothesis satisfactorily explains our sense-impressions. âI cannot seriously doubt that Professor Pearson himself believes in them as much as anyone else. Only, if he were to acknowledge it explicitly, he would have to rewrite almost every page of The Grammar of Science.â[1]
Ridiculeâthat is the response of the thinking scientists to the idealist philosophy over which Mach waxes so enthusiastic.
And here, finally, is the opinion of a German physicist, L. Boltzmann. The Machians will perhaps say, as Friedrich Adler said, that he is a physicist of the old school. But we are concerned now not with theories of physics but with a fundamental philosophical problem. Writing against people who âhave been carried away by the new epistemological dogmas,â Boltzmann says:
âMistrust of conceptions which we can derive only from immediate sense-impressions has led to an extreme which is the direct opposite of former naÃ¯ve belief. Only sense-impressions are given us, and, therefore, it is said, we have no right to go a step beyond. But to be consistent, one must further ask: are our sense-impressions of yesterday also given? What is immediately given is only the one sense-impression, or only the one thought, namely, the one we are thinking at the present moment. Hence, to be consistent, one would have to deny not only the existence of other people outside oneâs self, but also all conceptions we ever had in the past.â[2]
This physicist rightly ridicules the supposedly ânewâ âphenomenalistâ view of Mach and Co. as the old absurdity of philosophical subjective idealism.
No, it is those who âfailed to noteâ that solipsism is Machâs fundamental error who are stricken with âsubjectiveâ blindness.

Materialism and Empirio-criticism: Chapter 2.1, The 'Thing-In-Itself,' or V. Chernov Refutes Frederick Engels



V.I. Lenin
Materialism and Empirio-criticism
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy


Chapter 2.1



The 'Thing-In-Itself,' or V. Chernov Refutes Frederick Engels
Our Machians have written so much about the âthing-in itselfâ that were all their writings to be collected they would result in mountains of printed matter. The "thing-in-itselfâ is a veritable bÃªte noire with Bogdanov and Valentinov, Bazarov and Chernov, Berman and Yushkevich. There is no abuse they have not hurled at it, there is no ridicule they have not showered on it. And against whom are they breaking lances because of this luckless âthing-in-itselfâ? Here a division of the philosophers of Russian Machism according to political parties begins. All the would-be Marxists among the Machians are combating Plekhanovâs âthing-in-itself"; they accuse Plekhanov of having become entangled and straying into Kantianism, and of having forsaken Engels. (We shall discuss the first accusation in the fourth chapter; the second accusation we shall deal with now.) The Machian Mr. Victor Chernov, a Narodnik and a sworn enemy of Marxism, opens a direct campaign against Engels because of the âthing-in-itself.â
One is ashamed to confess it, but it would be a sin to conceal the fact that on this occasion open enmity towards Marxism has made Mr. Victor Chernov a more principled literary antagonist than our comrades in party and opponents in philosophy.[1] For only a guilty conscience (and in addition, perhaps, ignorance of materialism?) could have been responsible for the fact that the Machian would-be Marxists have diplomatically set Engels aside, have completely ignored Feuerbach and are circling exclusively around Plekhanov. It is indeed circling around one spot, tedious and petty pecking and cavilling at a disciple of Engels, while a frank examination of the views of the teacher himself is cravenly avoided. And since the purpose of these cursory comments is to disclose the reactionary character of Machism and the correctness of the materialism of Marx and Engels, we shall leave aside the fussing of the Machian would-be Marxists with Plekhanov and turn directly to Engels, whom the empirio-criticist Mr. V. Chernov refuted. In his Philosophical and Sociological Studies (Moscow, 1907âa collection of articles written, with few exceptions, before 1900) the article âMarxism and Transcendental Philosophyâ bluntly begins with an attempt to set up Marx against Engels and accuses the latter of ânaÃ¯ve dogmatic materialism,â of âthe crudest materialist dogmatismâ (pp. 29 and 32). Mr. V. Chernov states that a âsufficientâ example of this is Engelsâ argument against the Kantian thing-in itself and Humeâs philosophical line. We shall begin with this argument.
In his Ludwig Feuerbach, Engels declares that the fundamental philosophical trends are materialism and idealism. Materialism regards nature as primary and spirit as secondary; it places being first and thought second. Idealism holds the contrary view. This root distinction between the âtwo great campsâ into which the philosophers of the âvarious schoolsâ of idealism and materialism are divided Engels takes as the cornerstone, and he directly charges with âconfusionâ those who use the terms idealism and materialism in any other way.
âThe great basic question of all philosophy,â Engels says, âespecially of modern philosophy, is that concerning the relation of thinking and being,â of âspirit and nature.â Having divided the philosophers into âtwo great campsâ on this basic question, Engels shows that there is âyet another sideâ to this basic philosophical question, viz., âin what relation do our thoughts about the world surrounding us stand to this world itself? Is our thinking capable of the cognition of the real world? Are we able in our ideas and notions of the real world to produce a correct reflection of reality? [Fr. Engels, Ludwig Feuerbach, etc., 4th Germ. ed., p. 15. Russian translation, Geneva ed., 1905, pp. 12-13. Mr. V. Chernov translates the word Spiegelbild literally (a mirror reflection), accusing Plekhanov of presenting the theory of Engels âin a very weakened formâ by speaking in Russian simply of a âreflectionâ instead of a âmirror reflection.â This is mere cavilling. Spiegelbild in German is also used simply in the sense of Abbild]
âThe overwhelming majority of philosophers give an affirmative answer to this question,â says Engels, including under this head not only all materialists but also the most consistent idealists, as, for example, the absolute idealist Hegel, who considered the real world to be the realisation of some premundane âabsolute idea,â while the human spirit, correctly apprehending the real world, apprehends in it and through it the âabsolute idea.â
âIn addition [i.e., to the materialists and the consistent idealists] there is yet a set of different philosophersâthose who question the possibility of any cognition, or at least of an exhaustive cognition, of the world. To them, among the more modern ones, belong Hume and Kant, and they have played a very important role in philosophical development. . . .â[2]
Mr. V. Chernov, quoting these words of Engelsâ, launches into the fray. To the word âKantâ he makes the following annotation:
âIn 1888 it was rather strange to term such philosophers as Kant and especially Hume as âmodern.â At that time it was more natural to hear mentioned such names as Cohen, Lange, Riehl, Laas, Liebmann, Goring, etc. But Engels, evidently, was not well versed in âmodernâ philosophyâ (op. cit., p. 33, note 2).
Mr. V. Chernov is true to himself. Equally in economic and philosophical questions he reminds one of Turgenevâs Voroshilov,[3] annihilating now the ignorant Kautsky, [V. Ilyin, The Agrarian Question, Part I, St. Petersburg, 1908, p. 1908.] now the ignorant Engels by merely referring to âscholarlyâ names! The only trouble is that all the authorities mentioned by Mr. Chernov are the very Neo-Kantians whom Engels refers to on this very same page of his Ludwig Feuerbach as theoretical reactionaries, who were endeavouring to resurrect the corpse of the long since refuted doctrines of Kant and Hume. The good Chernov did not understand that it is just these authoritative (for Machism) and muddled professors whom Engels is refuting in his argument!
Having pointed out that Hegel had already presented the âdecisiveâ arguments against Hume and Kant, and that the additions made by Feuerbach are more ingenious than profound, Engels continues:
âThe most telling refutation of this as of all other philosophical crotchets (Schrullen) is practice, namely, experiment and industry. If we are able to prove the correctness of our conception of a natural process by making it ourselves, bringing it into being out of its conditions and making it serve our own purposes into the bargain, then there is an end to the Kantian incomprehensible [or ungraspable, unfassbarenâthis important word is omitted both in Plekhanovâs translation and in Mr. V. Chernovâs translation] âthing-in-itself.â The chemical substances produced in the bodies of plants and animals remained just such âthings-in-themselvesâ until organic chemistry began to produce them one after another, where upon the âthing-in-itselfâ became a âthing for us,â as, for instance, alizarin, the colouring matter of the madder, which we no longer trouble to grow in the madder roots in the field, but produce much more cheaply and simply from coal tarâ (op. cit., p. 16).[4]
Mr. V. Chernov, quoting this argument, finally loses patience and completely annihilates poor Engels. Listen to this:
âNo Neo-Kantian will of course be surprised that from coal tar we can produce alizarin âmore cheaply and simply.â But that together with alizarin it is possible to produce from this coal tar and just as cheaply a refutation of the âthing-in-itselfâ will indeed seem a wonderful and unprecedented discoveryâand not to the Neo-Kantians alone.
Engels, apparently, having learned that according to Kant the âthing-in-itselfâ is unknowable, turned this theorem into its converse and concluded that everything unknown is a thing-in-itselfâ (p. 33).
Listen, Mr. Machian: lie, but donât overdo it! Why, before the very eyes of the public you are misrepresenting the very quotation from Engels you have set out to âtear to pieces,â without even having grasped the point under discussion!
In the first place, it is not true that Engels âis producing a refutation of the thing-in-itself.â Engels said explicitly and clearly that he was refuting the Kantian ungraspable (or unknowable) thing-in-itself. Mr. Chernov confuses Engelsâ materialist conception of the existence of things independently of our consciousness. In the second place, if Kantâs theorem reads that the thing-in-itself is unknowable, the âconverseâ theorem would be: the unknowable is the thing in-itself. Mr. Chernov replaces the unknowable by the unknown, without realising that by such a substitution he has again confused and distorted the materialist view of Engels!
Mr. V. Chernov is so bewildered by the reactionaries of official philosophy whom he has taken as his mentors that he raises an outcry against Engels without in the least comprehending the meaning of the example quoted. Let us try to explain to this representative of Machism what it is all about.
Engels clearly and explicitly states that he is contesting both Hume and Kant. Yet there is no mention whatever in Hume of âunknowable things-in-themselves.â What then is there in common between these two philosophers? It is that they both in principle fence off âthe appearanceâ from that which appears, the perception from that which is perceived the thing-for-us from the âthing-in-itself.â Furthermore, Hume does not want to hear of the âthing-in-itself,â he regards the very thought of it as philosophically inadmissible, as âmetaphysicsâ (as the Humeans and Kantians call it); whereas Kant grants the existence of the âthing-in-itself,â but declares it to be âunknowable,â fundamentally different from the appearance, belonging to a fundamentally different realm, the realm of the âbeyondâ (Jenseits), inaccessible to knowledge, but revealed to faith.
What is the kernel of Engelsâ objections? Yesterday we did not know that coal tar contained alizarin. Today we learned that it does. The question is, did coal tar contain alizarin yesterday?
Of course it did. To doubt it would be to make a mockery of modern science.
And if that is so, three important epistemological conclusions follow:

Things exist independently of our consciousness, independently of our perceptions, outside of us, for it is beyond doubt that alizarin existed in coal tar yesterday and it is equally beyond doubt that yesterday we knew nothing of the existence of this alizarin and received no sensations from it.
There is definitely no difference in principle between the phenomenon and the thing-in-itself, and there can be no such difference. The only difference is between what is known and what is not yet known. And philosophical inventions of specific boundaries between the one and the other, inventions to the effect that the thing-in-itself is âbeyondâ phenomena (Kant), or that we can and must fence ourselves off by some philosophical partition from the problem of a world which in one part or another is still unknown but which exists outside us (Hume)âall this is the sheerest nonsense, Schrulle, crotchet, invention.
In the theory of knowledge, as in every other branch of science, we must think dialectically, that is, we must not regard our knowledge as ready-made and unalterable, but must determine how knowledge emerges from ignorance, how incomplete, inexact knowledge becomes more complete and more exact.

Once we accept the point of view that human knowledge develops from ignorance, we shall find millions of examples of it just as simple as the discovery of alizarin in coal tar, millions of observations not only in the history of science and technology but in the everyday life of each and every one of us that illustrate the transformation of âthings-in-themselvesâ into âthings-for-us,â the appearance of âphenomenaâ when our sense-organs experience an impact from external objects, the disappearance of âphenomenaâ when some obstacle prevents the action upon our sense-organs of an object which we know to exist. The sole and unavoidable deduction to be made from thisâa deduction which all of us make in everyday practice and which materialism deliberately places at the foundation of its epistemologyâis that outside us, and independently of us, there exist objects, things, bodies and that our perceptions are images of the external world. Machâs converse theory (that bodies are complexes of sensations) is nothing but pitiful idealist nonsense. And Mr. Chernov, in his âanalysisâ of Engels, once more revealed his Voroshilov qualities; Engelsâ simple example seemed to him âstrange and naÃ¯veâ! He regards only gelehrte fiction as genuine philosophy and is unable to distinguish professorial eclecticism from the consistent materialist theory of knowledge.
It is both impossible and unnecessary to analyse Mr. Chernovâs other arguments; they all amount to the same pretentious rigmarole (like the assertion that for the materialists the atom is the thing-in-itself!). We shall note only the argument which is relevant to our discussion (an argument which has apparently led certain people astray), viz., that Marx supposedly differed from Engels. The question at issue is Marxâs second Thesis on Feuerbach and Plekhanovâs translation of the word Diesseitigkeit.
Here is the second Thesis:
âThe question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory, but is a practical question. In practice man must prove the truth, i.e., the reality and power, the âthis-sidednessâ of his thinking. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question.â[5]
Instead of âprove the this-sidedness of thinkingâ (a literal translation), Plekhanov has: prove that thinking âdoes not stop at this side of phenomena.â And Mr. V. Chernov cries: âThe contradiction between Marx and Engels has been eliminated very simply. . . . It appears as though Marx, like Engels, asserted the knowability of things-in-themselves and the âother-sidednessâ of thinkingâ (loc. cit. p. 34, note).
What can be done with a Voroshilov whose every phrase makes confusion worse confoundedl It is sheer ignorance, Mr. Victor Chernov, not to know that all materialists assert the knowability of things-in-themselves. It is ignorance, Mr. Victor Chernov, or infinite slovenliness, to skip the very first phrase of the thesis and not to realise that the âobjective truthâ (gegenstÃ¤ndliche Wahrheit) of thinking means nothing else than the existence of objects (i.e., âthings-in-themselvesâ) truly reflected by thinking. It is sheer illiteracy Mr. Victor Chernov, to assert that from Plekhanovâs paraphrase (Plekhanov gave a paraphrase and not a translation) âit appears as thoughâ Marx defended the other-sidedness of thought. Because only the Humeans and the Kantians confine thought to âthis side of phenomena.â But for all materialists, including those of the seventeenth century whom Bishop Berkeley demolished (see Introduction), âphenomenaâ are âthings-for-usâ or copies of the âobjects in themselves.â Of course, Plekhanovâs free paraphrase is not obligatory upon those who desire to know Marx himself, but it is obligatory to try to understand what Marx meant and not to prance about like a Voroshilov.
It is interesting to note that while among people who call themselves socialists we encounter an unwillingness or inability to grasp the meaning of Marxâs âTheses,â bourgeois writers, specialists in philosophy, sometimes manifest greater scrupulousness. I know of one such writer who studied the philosophy of Feuerbach and in connection with it Marxâs âTheses.â That writer is Albert LÃ©vy, who devoted the third chapter of the second part of his book on Feuerbach to an examination of the influence of Feuerbach on Marx. [Albert LÃ©vy, La philosophie de Feuerbach et son influence sur la littÃ©ruture allemande [Feuerbachâs Philosophy and His Influence on German Literature] Paris, 1904, pp. 249-338, on the influence of Feuerbach on Marx, and pp. 290-98, an examination of the âTheses.â] Without going into the question whether LÃ©vy always interprets Feuerbach correctly, or how he criticises Marx from the ordinary bourgeois standpoint, we shall only quote his opinion of the philosophical content of Marxâs famous âTheses.â Regarding the first Thesis, LÃ©vy says:
âMarx, on the one hand, together with all earlier materialism and with Feuerbach, recognises that there are real and distinct objects outside us corresponding to our ideas of things. . . .â
As the reader sees, it was immediately clear to Albert Levy that the basic position not only of Marxist materialism but of every materialism, of âall earlierâ materialism, is the recognition of real objects outside us, to which objects our ideas âcorrespond.â This elementary truth, which holds good for all materialism in general, is unknown only to the Russian Machians. LÃ©vy continues:
â. . . On the other hand, Marx expresses regret that materialism had left it to idealism to appreciate the importance of the active forces [i.e., human practice], which, according to Marx, must be wrested from idealism in order to integrate them into the materialist system. But it will of course be necessary to give these active forces the real and sensible character which idealism cannot grant them. Marxâs idea, then, is the following: just as to our ideas there correspond real objects outside us, so to our phenomenal activity there corresponds a real activity outside us, an activity of things. In this sense humanity partakes of the absolute, not only through theoretical knowledge but also through practical activity; thus all human activity acquires a dignity, a nobility, that permits it to advance hand in hand with theory. Revolutionary activity henceforth acquires a metaphysical significance. . . .â
Albert LÃ©vy is a professor. And a proper professor must abuse the materialists as being metaphysicians. For the professorial idealists, Humeans and Kantians every kind of materialism is âmetaphysics,â because beyond the phenomenon (appearance, the thing-for-us) it discerns a reality outside us. A. LÃ©vy is therefore essentially right when he says that in Marxâs opinion there corresponds to manâs âphenomenal activityâ âan activity of things,â that is to say, human practice has not only a phenomenal (in the Humean and Kantian sense of the term), but an objectively real significance. The criterion of practiceâas we shall show in detail in its proper place (Â§ 6)âhas entirely different meanings for Mach and Marx. âHumanity partakes of the absoluteâ means that human knowledge reflects absolute truth ; the practice of humanity, by verifying our ideas, corroborates what in those ideas corresponds to absolute truth. A. LÃ©vy continues:
â. . . Having reached this point, Marx naturally encounters the objections of the critics. He has admitted the existence of things-in-themselves, of which our theory is the human translation. He cannot evade the usual objection: what assurance have you of the accuracy of the translation? What proof have you that the human mind gives you an objective truth? To this objection Marx replies in his second Thesisâ (p. 291).
The reader sees that LÃ©vy does not for a moment doubt that Marx recognised the existence of things-in-themselves!


Notes
[1] In preparing the first edition of Materialism end Empirio-criticism for the press, A. I. Ulyanova-Yelizarova altered the words âa more honest literary antagonistâ to âa more principled literary antagonistâ. Lenin objected to this correction and on February 27 (March 12), 1909, he wrote to his sister: âPlease do not tone down anything in the passages against Bogdanov, Lenaeharsky and C0. Toning down is impossible. You have done away with the statement that Cheraov is a âmore honestâ antagonist than they are, and that is a great pity. That shade is not brought out. It is not in accord with the whole nature of my accusations. The crux of the matter is that our Machists are dishonest, basely craven enemies of Marxism in philosophyâ (Collected Works, present edition, Volume 37., p. 416).

'Transcendence,' Or Bazarov 'Revises' Engels
But while the Russian Machian would-be Marxists diplomatically evaded one of the most emphatic and explicit statements of Engels, they ârevisedâ another statement of his in quite the Chernov manner. However tedious and laborious the task of correcting distortions and perversions of the meaning of quotations may be, he who wishes to speak of the Russian Machians cannot avoid it.
Here is Bazarovâs revision of Engels.
In the article âOn Historical Materialism,â [This article forms the Introduction to the English edition of Engelsâ Socialism: Utopian and Scientific and was translated by Engels himself into German in the Neue Zeit XI, I (1892-93, No. 1), S. 15 et seq. The only Russian translation, if I am not mistaken, is to be found in the symposium Historical Materialism p. 162, et seq. Bazarov quotes the passage in the Studies âinâ the Philosophy of Marxism, p. 64.] Engels speaks of the English agnostics (philosophers of Humeâs trend of thought) as follows:
â. . . Our agnostic admits that all our knowledge is based upon the information (Mitteilungen) imparted to us by our senses. . . .â
Let us note for the benefit of our Machians that the agnostic (Humean) also starts from sensations and recognises no other source of knowledge. The agnostic is a pure âpositivist,â be it said for the benefit of the adherents of the âlatest positivism!â
â. . . But, he [the agnostic] adds, how do we know that our senses give us correct representations (Abbilder) of the objects we perceive through them? And he proceeds to inform us that, whenever he speaks of objects or their qualities, he does in reality not mean these objects and qualities, of which he cannot know anything for certain, but merely the impressions which they have produced on his senses. . . .â[1]
What two lines of philosophical tendency does Engels contrast here? One line is that the senses give us faithful images of things, that we know the things themselves, that the outer world acts on our sense-organs. This is materialismâwith which the agnostic is not in agreement. What then is the essence of the agnosticâs line? It is that he does not go beyond sensations, that he stops on this side of phenomena, refusing to see anything âcertainâ beyond the boundary of sensations. About these things themselves (i.e., about the things-in-themselves, the âobjects in themselves,â as the materialists whom Berkeley opposed called them), we can know nothing certainâso the agnostic categorically insists. Hence, in the controversy of which Engels speaks the materialist affirms the existence and knowability of things-in-themselves. The agnostic does not even admit the thought of things-in-themselves and insists that we can know nothing certain about them.
It may be asked in what way the position of the agnostic as outlined by Engels differs from the position of Mach? In the ânewâ term âelementâ? But it is sheer childishness to believe that a nomenclature can change a philosophical line, that sensations when called âelementsâ cease to be sensations! Or does the difference lie in the ânewâ idea that the very same elements constitute the physical in one connection and the psychical in another? But did you not observe that Engelsâ agnostic also puts âimpressionsâ in place of the âthings themselvesâ? That means that in essence the agnostic too differentiates between physical and psychical âimpressionsâ! Here again the difference is exclusively one of nomenclature. When Mach says that objects are complexes of sensations, Mach is a Berkeleian; when Mach âcorrectsâ himself, and says that âelementsâ (sensations) can be physical in one connection and psychical in another, Mach is an agnostic, a Humean. Mach does not go beyond these two lines in his philosophy, and it requires extreme naÃ¯vetÃ© to take this muddlehead at his word and believe that he has actually âtranscendedâ both materialism and idealism.
Engels deliberately mentions no names in his exposition, and criticises not individual representatives of Humism (professional philosophers are very prone to call original systems the petty variations one or another of them makes in terminology or argument), but the whole Humean line. Engels criticises not particulars but the essential thing; he examines the fundamental wherein all Humeans deviate from materialism, and his criticism therefore embraces Mill, Huxley and Mach alike. Whether we say (with J. S. Mill) that matter is the permanent possibility of sensation, or (with Ernst Mach) that matter is more or less stable complexes of âelementsââsensationsâwe remain within the bounds of agnosticism, or Humism. Both standpoints, or more correctly both formulations, are covered by Engelsâ exposition of agnosticism: the agnostic does not go beyond sensations and asserts that he cannot know anything certain about their source, about their original, etc. And if Mach attributes such great importance to his disagreement with Mill on this question, it is because Mach comes under Engelsâ characterisation of a professor-in-ordinary: Flohknacker.â Ay, gentlemen, you have only cracked a flea by making petty corrections and by altering terminology instead of entirely abandoning the basic, half-hearted standpoint.
And how does the materialist Engelsâat the beginning of the article Engels explicitly and emphatically contrasts his materialism to agnosticismârefute the foregoing arguments?
â. . . Now, this line of reasoning seems undoubtedly hard to beat by mere argumentation. But before there was argumentation there was action. Im Anfang war die That. And human action had solved the difficulty long before human ingenuity invented it. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. From the moment we turn to our own use these objects, according to the qualities we perceive in them, we put to an infallible test the correctness or otherwise of our sense-perceptions. If these perceptions have been wrong, then our estimate of the use to which an object can be turned must also be wrong, and our attempt must fail. But if we succeed in accomplishing our aim, if we find that the object does agree with our idea of it, and does answer the purpose we intended it for, then that is positive proof that our perceptions of it and of its qualities, so far, agree with reality outside ourselves. . . .â
Thus, the materialist theory, the theory of the reflection of objects by our mind, is here presented with absolute clarity: things exist outside us. Our perceptions and ideas are their images. Verification of these images, differentiation between true and false images, is given by practice. But let us listen to a little more of Engels (Bazarov at this point ends his quotation from Engels, or rather from Plekhanov, for he deems it unnecessary to deal with Engels himself):
â. . . And whenever we find ourselves face to face with a failure, then we generally are not long in making out the cause that made us fail; we find that the perception upon which we acted was either incomplete and superficial, or combined with the results of other perceptions in a way not warranted by them [the Russian translation in On Historical Materialism is incorrect]. So long as we take care to train and to use our senses properly, and to keep our action within the limits prescribed by perceptions properly made and properly used, so long we shall find that the result of our action proves the conformity (Uebereinstimmung) of our perceptions with the objective (gegenstandlich) nature of the things perceived. Not in one single instance, so far, have we been led to the conclusion that our sense-perceptions, scientifically controlled, induce in our minds ideas respecting the outer world that are, by their very nature, at variance with reality, or that there is an inherent incompatibility between the outer world and our sense-perceptions of it.
But then come the Neo-Kantian agnostics and say. . . .â[2]
We shall leave to another time the examination of the arguments of the Neo-Kantians. Let us remark here that anybody in the least acquainted with the subject, or even the least bit attentive, cannot fail to understand that Engels is here expounding the very same materialism against which the Machians are always and everywhere doing battle. And now just watch the manner in which Bazarov revises Engels:
âHere,â writes Bazarov in connection with the fragment of the quotation we have given, âEngels is actually attacking Kantian idealism. . . .â
It is not true. Bazarov is muddling things. In the passage which he quoted, and which is quoted by us more fully, there is not a syllable either about Kantianism or about idealism. Had Bazarov really read the whole of Engelsâ article, he could not have avoided seeing that Engels speaks of Neo-Kantianism, and of Kantâs whole line, only in the next paragraph, just where we broke off our quotation. And had Bazarov attentively read and reflected on the fragment he himself quotes, he could not have avoided seeing that in the arguments of the agnostic which Engels here refutes there is not a trace of either idealism or Kantianism; for idealism begins only when the philosopher says that things are our sensations, while Kantianism begins when the philosopher says that the thing-in-itself exists but is unknowable. Bazarov confuses Kantianism with Humism; and he confuses them because, being himself a semi-Berkeleian, semi-Humean of the Machian sect, he does not understand (as will be shown in detail below) the distinction between the Humean and the materialist opposition to Kantianism.
Bazarov continues:
â. . . But, alas! his argument is aimed against Plekhanovâs philosophy just as much as it is against Kantian philosophy. In the school of Plekhanov-Orthodox, as Bogdanov has already pointed out, there is a fatal misunderstanding regarding consciousness. To Plekhanov, as to all idealists, it seems that everything perceptually given, i.e., cognised, is âsubjectiveâ; that to proceed only from what is factually given is to be a solipsist; that real being can be found only beyond the boundaries of everything that is immediately given. . . .â
This is entirely in the spirit of Chernov and his assurances that Liebknecht was a true-Russian Narodnik! If Plekhanov is an idealist who has deserted Engels, then why is it that you, who are supposedly an adherent of Engels, are not a materialist? This is nothing but wretched mystification, Comrade Bazarov! By means of the Machian expression âimmediately givenâ you begin to confuse the difference between agnosticism, idealism and materialism. Donât you understand that such expressions as the âimmediately givenâ and the âfactually givenâ are part of the rigmarole of the Machians, the immanentists, and the other reactionaries in philosophy, a masquerade, whereby the agnostic (and sometimes, as in Machâs case, the idealist too) disguises himself in the cloak of the materialist? For the materialist the âfactually givenâ is the outer world, the image of which is our sensations. For the idealist the âfactually givenâ is sensation, and the outer world is declared to be a âcomplex of sensations.â For the agnostic the âimmediately givenâ is also sensation, but the agnostic does not go on either to the materialist recognition of the reality of the outer world, or to the idealist recognition of the world as our sensation. Therefore your statement that âreal being [according to Plekhanov] can be found only beyond the boundaries of everything that is immediately givenâ is sheer nonsense and inevitably follows from your Machian position. But while you have a perfect right to adopt any position you choose, including a Machian one, you have no right to falsify Engels once you have undertaken to speak of him. And from Engelsâ words it is perfectly clear that for the materialist real being lies beyond the âsense-perceptions,â impressions and ideas of man, while for the agnostic it is impossible to go beyond these perceptions. Bazarov believed Mach, Avenarius, and Schuppe when they said that the âimmediatelyâ (or factually) given connects the perceiving self with the perceived environment in the famous âindissolubleâ co-ordination, and endeavours, unobserved by the reader, to impute this nonsense to the materialist Engels!
â. . . It is as though the foregoing passage from Engels was deliberately written by him in a very popular and accessible form in order to dissipate this idealist misunderstanding. . . .â
Not for nought was Bazarov a pupil of Avenarius! He continues his mystification: under the pretence of combating idealism (of which Engels is not speaking here), he smuggles in the idealist âco-ordination.â Not bad, Comrade Bazarov!
â. . . The agnostic asks, how do we know that our subjective senses give us a correct presentation of objects?. . .â
You are muddling things, Comrade Bazarov! Engels himself does not speak of, and does not even ascribe to his foe the agnostic, such nonsense as âsubjectiveâ senses. There are no other senses except human, i.e., âsubjectiveâ senses, for we are speaking from the standpoint of man and not of a hobgoblin. You are again trying to impute Machism to Engels, to imply that he says: the agnostic regards senses, or, to be more precise, sensations, as only subjective (which the agnostic does not do!), while we and Avenarius have âco-ordinatedâ the object into an indissoluble connection with the subject. Not bad, Comrade Bazarov!
â. . . But what do you term âcorrectâ?âEngels rejoins.âThat is correct which is confirmed by our practice; and consequently, since our sense-perceptions are confirmed by experience, they are not âsubjective,â that is, they are not arbitrary, or illusory, but correct and real as such. . . .â
You are muddling things, Comrade Bazarov! You have substituted for the question of the existence of things outside our sensations, perceptions, ideas, the question of the criterion of the correctness of our ideas of âthese things themselves,â or, more precisely, you are hedging the former question with the help of the latter. But Engels says explicitly and clearly that what distinguishes him from the agnostic is not only the agnosticâs doubt as to whether our images are âcorrect,â but also the agnosticâs doubt as to whether we may speak of the things themselves, as to whether we may have âcertainâ knowledge of their existence. Why did Bazarov resort to this juggling? In order to obscure and confound what is the basic question for materialism (and for Engels, as a materialist), viz., the question of the existence of things outside our mind, which, by acting on our sense-organs evoke sensations. It is impossible to be a materialist without answering this question in the affirmative; but one can be a materialist and still differ on what constitutes the criterion of the correctness of the images presented by our senses.
And Bazarov muddles matters still more when he attributes to Engels, in the dispute with the agnostic, the absurd and ignorant expression that our sense-perceptions are confirmed by âexperience.â Engels did not use and could not have used this word here, for Engels was well aware that the idealist Berkeley, the agnostic Hume and the materialist Diderot all had recourse to experience.
â. . . Inside the limits within which we have to do with objects in practice, perceptions of the object and of its properties coincide with the reality existing outside us. âTo coincideâ is somewhat different from being a âhieroglyphic.â âThey coincideâ means that, within the given limits, the sense perception is [Bazarovâs italics] the reality existing outside us. . . .â
The end crowns the work! Engels has been treated Ã  la Mach, fried and served with a Machian sauce. But take care you do not choke, worthy cooks!
âSense-perception is the reality existing outside usâ!! This is just the fundamental absurdity, the fundamental muddle and falsity of Machism, from which flows all the rest of the balderdash of this philosophy and for which Mach and Avenarius have been embraced by those arrant reactionaries and preachers of priestlore, the immanentists. However much V. Bazarov wriggled, however cunning and diplomatic he was in evading ticklish points, in the end he gave himself away and betrayed his true Machian character! To say that âsense-perception is the reality existing outside usâ is to return to Humism, or even Berkeleianism, concealing itself in the fog of âco-ordination.â This is either an idealist lie or the subterfuge of the agnostic, Comrade Bazarov, for sense-perception is not the reality existing outside us, it is only the image of that reality. Are you trying to make capital of the ambiguous Russian word sovpadat? Are you trying to lead the unsophisticated reader to believe that sovpadat here means âto be identical,â and not âto correspondâ? That means basing oneâs falsification of Engels Ã  la Mach on a perversion of the meaning of a quotation, and nothing more.
Take the German original and you will find there the words stimmen mit, which means to correspond with, âto voice withââthe latter translation is literal, for Stimme means voice. The words âstimmen mitâ cannot mean âto coincideâ in the sense of âto be identical.â And even for the reader who does not know German but who reads Engels with the least bit of attention, it is perfectly clear, it cannot be otherwise than clear, that Engels throughout his whole argument treats the expression âsense-perceptionâ as the image (Abbild) of the reality existing outside us, and that therefore the word âcoincideâ can be used in Russian exclusively in the sense of âcorrespondence,â âconcurrence,â etc. To attribute to Engels the thought that âsense-perception is the reality existing outside usâ is such a pearl of Machian distortion, such a flagrant attempt to palm off agnosticism and idealism as materialism, that one must admit that Bazarov has broken all records!
One asks, how can sane people in sound mind and judgment assert that âsense-perception [within what limits is not important] is the reality existing outside usâ? The earth is a reality existing outside us. It cannot âcoincideâ (in the sense of being identical) with our sense-perception, or be in indissoluble co-ordination with it, or be a âcomplex of elementsâ in another connection identical with sensation; for the earth existed at a time when there were no men, no sense-organs, no matter organised in that superior form in which its property of sensation is in any way clearly perceptible.
That is just the point, that the tortuous theories of âco-ordination,â âintrojection,â and the newly-discovered world elements which we analysed in Chapter I serve to cover up this idealist absurdity. Bazarovâs formulation, so inadvertently and incautiously thrown off by him, is excellent in that it patently reveals that crying absurdity, which otherwise it would have been necessary to excavate from the piles of erudite, pseudo-scientific, professorial rigmarole.
All praise to you, Comrade Bazarov! We shall erect a monument to you in your lifetime. On one side we shall engrave your dictum, and on the other: âTo the Russian Machian who dug the grave of Machism among the Russian Marxists!â

We shall speak separately of the two points touched on by Bazarov in the above-mentioned quotation, viz., the criteria of practice of the agnostics (Machians included) and the materialists, and the difference between the theory of reflection (or images) and the theory of symbols (or hieroglyphs). For the present we shall continue to quote a little more from Bazarov:
â. . . But what is beyond these boundaries? Of this Engels does not say a word. He nowhere manifests a desire to perform that âtranscendence,â that stepping beyond the boundaries of the perceptually-given world, which lies at the foundation of Plekhanovâs âtheory of knowledgeâ. . . .â
Beyond what âboundariesâ? Does he mean the boundaries of the âco-ordinationâ of Mach and Avenarius, which supposedly indissolubly merges the self with the environment, the subject with the object? The very question put by Bazarov is devoid of meaning. But if he had put the question in an intelligible way, he would have clearly seen that the external world lies âbeyond the boundariesâ of manâs sensations, perceptions and ideas. But the word âtranscendenceâ once more betrays Bazarov. It is a specifically Kantian and Humean âfancyâ to erect in principle a boundary between the appearance and the thing-in-itself. To pass from the appearance, or, if you will, from our sensation, perception, etc., to the thing existing outside of perception is a transcendence, Kant says; and transcendence is permissible not to knowledge but to faith. Transcendence is not permissible at all, Hume objects. And the Kantians, like the Humeans, call the materialists transcendental realists, âmetaphysicians,â who effect an illegitimate passage (in Latin, transcensus) from one region to another, fundamentally different, region. In the works of the contemporary professors of philosophy who follow the reactionary line of Kant and Hume, you may encounter (take only the names enumerated by Voroshilov-Chernov) endless repetitions made in a thousand keys of the charge that materialism is âmetaphysicalâ and âtranscendent.â Bazarov borrowed from the reactionary professors both the word and the line of thought, and flourishes them in the name of ârecent positivismâ! As a matter of fact the very idea of the âtranscendence,â i.e., of a boundary in principle between the appearance and the thing-in-itself, is a nonsensical idea of the agnostics (Humeans and Kantians included) and the idealists. We have already explained this in connection with Engelsâ example of alizarin, and we shall explain it again in the words of Feuerbach and Joseph Dietzgen. But let us first finish with Bazarovâs ârevisionâ of Engels:
â. . . In one place in his Anti-DÃ¼hring, Engels says that âbeingâ outside of the realm of perception is an offene Frage, i.e., a question, for the answer to which, or even for the asking of which we have no data.â
Bazarov repeats this argument after the German Machian, Friedrich Adler. This last example is perhaps even worse than the âsense-perceptionâ which âis the reality existing outside us.â In his Anti-DÃ¼hring, p. 31 (5th Germ. ed.), Engels says:
âThe unity of the world does not consist in its being, although its being is a pre-condition of its unity, as it must certainly first be, before it can be one. Being, indeed, is always an open question (offene Frage) beyond the point where our sphere of observation (Gesichtskreis) ends. The real unity of the world consists in its materiality, and this is proved not by a few juggling phrases, but by a long and wearisome development of philosophy and natural science.â[3]
Behold the new hash our cook has prepared. Engels is speaking of being beyond the point where our sphere of observation ends, for instance, the existence of men on Mars. Obviously, such being is indeed an open question. And Bazarov, as though deliberately refraining from giving the full quotation, paraphrases Engels as saying that âbeing beyond the realm of perceptionâ is an open question!! This is the sheerest nonsense and Engels is here being saddled with the views of those professors of philosophy whom Bazarov is accustomed to take at their word and whom Dietzgen justly called the graduated flunkeys of clericalism or fideism. Indeed, fideism positively asserts that something does exist âbeyond the world of perception.â The materialists, in agreement with natural science, vigorously deny this. An intermediate position is held by those professors, Kantians, Humeans (including the Machians), etc., âwho have found the truth outside materialism and idealismâ and who âcompromise,â saying: it is an open question. Had Engels ever said anything like this, it would be a shame and disgrace to call oneself a Marxist.
But enough! Half a page of quotation from Bazarov presents such a complete tangle that we are obliged to content ourselves with what has already been said and not to continue following all the waverings of Machian thought.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Two: The Theory of Knowledge of Empirio-Criticism and of Dialectical Materialism. II )
3. L. Feuerbach and
J. Dietzgen on the Thing-In-Itself

To show how absurd are the assertions of our Machians that the
      materialists Marx and Engels denied the existence of
      things-in-themselves (i.e., things outside our sensations,

    

perceptions, and so forth) and the possibility of their
      cognition, and that they admitted the existence of an absolute
      boundary between the appearance and the thing-in-itself, we
      shall give a few more quotations from Feuerbach. The whole
      trouble with our Machians is that they set about parroting the
      words of the reactionary professors on dialectical materialism
      without themselves knowing anything either of
      dialectics or of materialism.
    

      “Modern philosophical spiritualism,” says Feuerbach,
      “which calls itself idealism, utters the annihilating, in
      its own opinion, stricture against materialism that it is
      dogmatism, viz., that it starts from the sensuous
      (sinnlichen) world as though from an undisputed
      (ausgemacht) objective truth, and assumes that it is a
      world in itself (an sich), i.e., as existing without
      us, while in reality the world is only a product of
      spirit” (Sämtliche Werke, X. Band, 1866,
      S. 185).
    

This seems clear enough. The world in itself is a world that
      exists without us. This materialism of
      Feuerbach’s, like the materialism of the seventeenth
      century contested by Bishop Berkeley, consisted in the
      recognition that “objects in themselves” exist
      outside our mind. The an sich (of itself, or “in
      itself”) of Feuerbach is the direct opposite of the an
      sich of Kant. Let us recall the excerpt from Feuerbach
      already quoted, where he rebukes Kant because for the latter the
      “thing-in-itself” is an “abstraction without
      reality.” For Feuerbach the “thing-in-itself”
      is an “abstraction with reality,” that is,
      a world existing outside us, completely knowable and
      fundamentally not different from “appearance.”
    

Feuerbach very ingeniously and clearly explains how ridiculous
      it is to postulate a “transcendence” from the world
      of phenomena to the world in itself, a sort of impassable gulf
      created by the priests and taken over from them by the
      professors of philosophy. Here is one of his explanations:
    

      “Of course, the products of fantasy are also products of
      nature, for the force of fantasy, like all other human forces,
      is in the last analysis (zuletzt) both in its basis and
      in its origin a force of nature; nevertheless, a human being is
      a being distinguished from the sun, moon and stars, from stones,
      animals and plants, in a word, from those beings
      (Wesen) which he designates by the general name,
      ‘nature’;

    

and consequently, man’s
      presentations (Bilder) of the sun, moon and stars and
      the other beings of nature (Naturwesen), although these
      presentations are products of nature, are yet products distinct
      from their objects in nature” (Werke, Band VII,
      Stuttgart, 1903, S. 516).
    

The objects of our ideas are distinct from our ideas, the
      thing-in-itself is distinct from the thing-for-us, for the
      latter is only a part, or only one aspect, of the former, just
      as man himself is only a fragment of the nature reflected in his
      ideas.
    

      “. . . The taste-nerve is just as much a product of nature
      as salt is, but it does not follow from this that the taste of
      salt is directly as such an objective property of salt, that
      what salt is merely as an object of sensation it also is in
      itself (an und für sich), hence that the sensation
      of salt on the tongue is a property of salt thought of without
      sensation (des ohne Empfindung gedachten
      Salzes). . . .” And several pages earlier:
      “Saltiness, as a taste, is the subjective expression of an
      objective property of salt” (ibid, p. 514).
    

Sensation is the result of the action of a thing-in-itself,
      existing objectively outside us, upon our
      sense-organs—such is Feuerbach’s theory. Sensation
      is a subjective image of the objective world, of the world
      an und für sich.
    

      “. . . So is man also a being of nature
      (Naturwesen), like sun, star, plant, animal, and stone,
      nevertheless, he is distinct from nature, and, consequently,
      nature in the head and heart of man is distinct from nature
      outside the human head and heart.”
    

      “. . . However, this object, viz., man, is the
      only object in which, according to the statement of the
      idealists themselves, the requirement of the ‘identity of
      object and subject’ is realised; for man is an object
      whose equality and unity with my being are beyond all possible
      doubt. . . . And is not one man for another, even the most
      intimate, an object of fantasy, of the imagination? Does not
      each man comprehend another in his own way, after his own mind
      (in und nach seinem Sinne)? . . . And if even between
      man and man, between mind and mind, there is a very considerable
      difference which it is impossible to ignore, how much greater
      must be the difference between an unthinking, non-human,



      dissimilar (to us)

being in itself (Wesen an sich)

and the

    

same being as we think of it, perceive it and apprehend
      it?” (ibid., p. 518).
    

All the mysterious, sage and subtle distinctions between the
      phenomenon and the thing-in-itself are sheer philosophical
      balderdash. In practice each one of us has observed times
      without number the simple and palpable transformation of the
      “thing-in-itself” into phenomenon, into the
      “thing-for-us.” It is precisely this transformation
      that is cognition. The “doctrine” of Machism that
      since we know only sensations, we cannot know of the
      existence of anything beyond the bounds of sensation,
      is an old sophistry of idealist and agnostic philosophy served
      up with a new sauce.
    

Joseph Dietzgen is a dialectical materialist. We shall show
      below that his mode of expression is often inexact, that he is
      often not free from confusion, a fact which has been seized upon
      by various foolish people (Eugen Dietzgen among them) and of
      course by our Machians. But they did not take the trouble or
      were unable to analyse the dominant line of his philosophy and
      to disengage his materialism from alien elements.
    

      “Let us take the world as the
      ‘thing-in-itself,’” says Dietzgen in his
      The Nature of the Workings of the Human Mind. “We
      shall easily see that the ‘world in itself’
      and the world as it appears to us, the phenomena of the
      world, differ from each other only as the whole differs from its
      parts” (Germ. ed., 1903, p. 65). “A phenomenon
      differs no more and no less from the thing which produces it
      than the ten-mile stretch of a road differs from the road
      itself” (pp. 71-72). There is not, nor can there be, any
      essential difference here, any “transcendence,” or
      “innate disagreement.” But a difference there is, to
      be sure, viz., the passage beyond the
      bounds of sense-perceptions to the existence of things
      outside us.
    

      “We learn by experience (wir erfahren),”
      says Dietzgen in his Excursions of a Socialist into the
      Domain of the Theory of Knowledge, “that each
      experience is only a part of that which, in the words of Kant,
      passes beyond the bounds of all experience. . . . For a
      consciousness that has become conscious of its own nature, each
      particle, be it of dust, or of

    

stone, or of wood, is something
      unknowable in its full extent (Unauskenntliches), i.e.,
      each particle is inexhaustible material for the human faculty of
      cognition and, consequently, something which passes beyond
      experience” (Kleinere philosophische Schriften
      [Smaller Philosophical Essays], 1903, S. 199).
    

You see: in the words of Kant, i.e.,
      adopting—exclusively for purposes of popularisation, for
      purposes of contrast—Kant’s erroneous,
      confusing terminology, Dietzgen recognises the passage
      “beyond experience.” This is a good example of what
      the Machians are grasping at when they pass from materialism to
      agnosticism: you see, they say, we do not wish to go
      “beyond experience”, for us “sense-perception
      is the reality existing outside us.”
    

      “Unhealthy mysticism [Dietzgen says, objecting precisely
      to such a philosophy] unscientifically separates the absolute
      truth from the relative truth. It makes of the thing as it
      appears and the ‘thing-in-itself,’ that is, of the
      appearance and the verity, two categories which differ toto
      coelo [completely, fundamentally] from each other and are
      not contained in any common category” (S. 200).
    

We can now judge the knowledge and ingenuity of Bogdanov, the
      Russian Machian, who does not wish to acknowledge himself a
      Machian and wishes to be regarded as a Marxist in philosophy.
    

      “A golden mean [between “panpsychism and
      panmaterialism”] has been adopted by materialists of a
      more critical shade who have rejected the absolute
      unknowability of the ‘thing-in-itself,’ but at the
      same time regard it as being fundamentally
      [Bogdanov’s italics] different from the
      ‘phenomenon’ and, therefore, always only
      ‘dimly discernible’ in it, outside of experience as
      far as its content is concerned [that is, presumably, as far as
      the “elements” are concerned, which are not the same
      as elements of experience], but yet lying within the bounds of
      what is called the forms of experience, i.e., time, space and
      causality. Such is approximately the standpoint of the French
      materialists of the eighteenth century and among the modern
      philosophers—Engels and his Russian follower,
      Beltov[1]” (Empirio-Monism, Bk. II, 2nd
      ed., 1907, pp. 40-41).
    
 

This is a complete muddle. 1) The materialists of the
      seventeenth century, against whom Berkeley argues, hold
      that “objects in themselves” are absolutely
      knowable, for our presentations, ideas, are only copies or
      reflections of those objects, which exist “outside the
      mind” (see Introduction). 2)
      Feuerbach, and
      J. Dietzgen after him, vigorously dispute any
      “fundamental” difference between the thing-in-itself
      and the phenomenon, and Engels disposes of this view by his
      brief example of the transformation of the
      “thing-in-itself” into the
      “thing-for-us.” 3) Finally, to maintain that the
      materialists regard things-in-themselves as “always only
      dimly discernible in the phenomenon” is sheer nonsense, as
      we have seen from Engels’ refutation of the agnostic. The
      reason for Bogdanov’s distortion of materialism lies in
      his failure to understand the relation of absolute truth to
      relative truth (of which we shall speak later). As regards the
      “outside-of-experience” thing-in-itself and the
      “elements of experience,” these are already the
      beginnings of the Machian muddle of which we have already said
      enough.
    

Parroting the incredible nonsense uttered by the reactionary
      professors about the materialists, disavowing Engels in 1907,
      and attempting to “revise” Engels into agnosticism
      in 1908—such is the philosophy of the “recent
      positivism” of the Russian Machians!

      Lenin
MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Two: The Theory of Knowledge of Empirio-Criticism and of Dialectical Materialism. II )
4. Does Objective Truth Exist?

Bogdanov declares: “As I understand it, Marxism contains a
      denial of the unconditional objectivity of any truth whatsoever,
      the denial of all eternal truths”
      (Empirio-Monism, Bk. III, pp. iv-v). What is meant by
      “unconditional objectivity”? “Truth
      for all eternity” is “an objective truth in the
      absolute meaning of the word,” says Bogdanov in the same
      passage, and agrees to recognise “objective truth only
      within the limits of a given epoch.”
    

Two questions are obviously confused here: 1) Is there such a
      thing as objective truth, that is, can human ideas have a
      content that does not depend on a subject, that does not depend
      either on a human being, or on humanity? 2) If so, can human
      ideas, which give expression to objective truth, express it all
      at one time, as a whole, unconditionally, absolutely, or only
      approximately, relatively? This second

    

question is a question of
      the relation of absolute truth to relative truth.


Bogdanov replies to the second question clearly, explicitly and
      definitely by rejecting even the slightest admission of absolute
      truth and by accusing Engels of eclecticism for making
      such an admission. Of this discovery of eclecticism in Engels by
      A. Bogdanov we shall speak separately later on. For the present
      we shall confine ourselves to the first question, which
      Bogdanov, without saying so explicitly, likewise answers in the
      negative—for although it is possible to deny the element
      of relativity in one or another human idea without denying the
      existence of objective truth, it is impossible to deny absolute
      truth without denying the existence of objective truth.



      “. . . The criterion of objective truth,” writes
      Bogdanov a little further on (p. ix), “in Beltov’s
      sense, does not exist truth is an ideological form, an
      organising form of human experience. . . .”


Neither “Beltov’s sense”—for it is a
      question of one of the fundamental philosophical problems and
      not of Beltov—nor the criterion of truth—which must
      be treated separately, without confounding it with the question
      of whether objective truth exists—has anything to
      do with the case here. Bogdanov’s negative answer to the
      latter question is clear: if truth is only an
      ideological form, then there can be no truth independent of the
      subject, of humanity, for neither Bogdanov nor we know any other
      ideology but human ideology. And Bogdanov’s negative
      answer emerges still more clearly from the second half of his
      statement: if truth is a form of human experience, then there
      can be no truth independent of humanity; there can be no
      objective truth.
    

Bogdanov’s denial of objective truth is agnosticism and
      subjectivism. The absurdity of this denial is evident even from
      the single example of a scientific truth quoted above. Natural
      science leaves no room for doubt that its assertion that the
      earth existed prior to man is a truth. This is entirely
      compatible with the materialist theory of knowledge: the
      existence of the thing reflected independent of the reflector
      (the independence of the external world from the mind) is a
      fundamental tenet of materialism. The

    

assertion made by science
      that the earth existed prior to man is an objective truth. This
      proposition of natural science is incompatible with the
      philosophy of the Machians and with their doctrine of truth: if
      truth is an organising form of human experience, then the
      assertion that the earth exists outside human
      experience cannot be true.
    

But that is not all. If truth is only an organising form of
      human experience, then the teachings, say, of Catholicism are
      also true. For there is not the slightest doubt that Catholicism
      is an “organising form of human experience.”
      Bogdanov himself senses the crying falsity of his theory and it
      is extremely interesting to watch how he attempts to extricate
      himself from the swamp into which he has fallen.
    

      “The basis of objectivity,” we read in Book I of
      Empirio-Monism, “must lie in the sphere of
      collective experience. We term those data of experience
      objective which have the same vital meaning for us and for other
      people, those data upon which not only we construct our
      activities without contradiction, but upon which, we are
      convinced, other people must also base themselves in order to
      avoid contradiction. The objective character of the physical
      world consists in the fact that it exists not for me personally,
      but for everybody [that is not true! It exists
      independently of “everybody”!], and has a
      definite meaning for everybody, the same, I am convinced, as for
      me. The objectivity of the physical series is its universal
      significance” (p. 25, Bogdanov’s
      italics). “The objectivity of the physical bodies we
      encounter in our experience is in the last analysis established
      by the mutual verification and coordination of the utterances of
      various people. In general, the physical world is
      socially-co-ordinated, socially-harmonised, in a word,
      socially-organised experience” (p. 36,
      Bogdanov’s italics).
    

We shall not repeat that this is a fundamentally untrue,
      idealist definition, that the physical world exists
      independently of humanity and of human experience, that the
      physical world existed at a time when no “sociality”
      and no “organisation” of human experience was
      possible, and so forth. We shall now on an exposure of the
      Machian philosophy from another aspect, namely, that objectivity
      is so defined that religious doctrines, ‘which undoubtedly
      possess a “universal significance”, and so forth,
      come under the definition.

    

But listen to Bogdanov again:
      “We remind the reader once more that
      ‘objective’ experience is by no means the same as
      ‘social’ experience.... Social experience is far
      from being altogether socially organised and always contains
      various contradictions, so that certain of its parts do not
      agree with others. Sprites and hobgoblins may exist in the
      sphere of social experience of a given people or of a given
      group of people-for example, the peasantry; but they need not
      therefore be included under socially-organised or objective
      experience, for they do not harmonise with the rest of
      collective experience and do not fit in with its organising
      forms, for example, with the chain of causality” (45).
    

Of course it is very gratifying that Bogdanov himself
      “does not include” social experience in regard to
      sprites and hobgoblins under objective experience. But this
      well-meant amendment in the spirit of anti-fideism by no means
      corrects the fundamental error of Bogdanov’s whole
      position. Bogdanov’s definition of objectivity and of the
      physical world completely falls to the ground, since the
      religious doctrine has “universal significance” to a
      greater degree than the scientific doctrine; the greater part of
      mankind cling to the former doctrine to this day. Catholicism
      has been “socially organised, harmonised and
      co-ordinated” by centuries of development; it
      “fits in” with the “chain of
      causality” in the most indisputable manner; for religions
      did not originate without cause, it is not by accident that they
      retain their hold over the masses under modern conditions, and
      it is quite “in the order of things” that professors
      of philosophy should adapt themselves to them. If this
      undoubtedly universally significant and undoubtedly
      highly-organised religious social experience does “not
      harmonise” with the “experience” of science,
      it is because there is a radical and fundamental difference
      between the two, which Bogdanov obliterated when he rejected
      objective truth. And however much Bogdanov tries to
      “correct” himself by saying that fideism, or
      clericalism, does not harmonise with science, the undeniable
      fact remains that Bogdanov’s denial of objective truth
      completely “harmonises” with fideism. Contemporary
      fideism does not at all reject science; all it rejects is the
      “exaggerated claims” of science, to wit, its claim
      to objective truth. If objective truth exists (as

    

the
      materialists think), if natural science, reflecting the outer
      world in human “experience,” is alone capable of
      giving us objective truth, then all fideism is absolutely
      refuted. But if there is no objective truth, if truth (including
      scientific truth) is only an organising form of human
      experience, then this in itself is an admission of the
      fundamental premise of clericalism, the door is thrown open for
      it, and a place is cleared for the “organising
      forms” of religious experience.
    

The question arises, does this denial of objective truth belong
      personally to Bogdanov, who refuses to own himself a Machian, or
      does it follow from the fundamental teachings of Mach and
      Avenarius? The latter is the only possible answer to the
      question. If only sensation exists in the world (Avenarius in
      1876), if bodies are complexes of sensations (Mach, in the
      Analysis of Sensations), then we are obviously
      confronted with a philosophical subjectivism which inevitably
      leads to the denial of objective truth. And if sensations are
      called “elements” which in one connection give rise
      to the physical and in another to the psychical, this, as we
      have seen, only confuses but does not reject the fundamental
      point of departure of empirio-criticism. Avenarius and Mach
      recognise sensations as the source of our
      knowledge. Consequently, they adopt the standpoint of empiricism
      (all knowledge derives from experience) or sensationalism (all
      knowledge derives from sensations). But this standpoint gives
      rise to the difference between the fundamental philosophical
      trends, idealism and materialism and does not eliminate that
      difference, no matter in what “new” verbal garb
      (“elements”) you clothe it. Both the solipsist, that
      is, the subjective idealist, and the materialist may regard
      sensations as the source of our knowledge. Both Berkeley and
      Diderot started from Locke. The first premise of the theory of
      knowledge undoubtedly is that the sole source of our knowledge
      is sensation. Having recognised the first premise, Mach confuses
      the second important premise, i.e., regarding the objective
      reality that is given to man in his sensations, or that forms
      the source of man’s sensations. Starting from sensations,
      one may follow the line of subjectivism, which leads to
      solipsism (“bodies are complexes or combinations of
      sensations”), or the line of objectivism, which leads to

    

materialism (sensations are images of objects, of the external
      world). For the first point of view, i.e., agnosticism, or,
      pushed a little further, subjective idealism, there can be no
      objective truth. For the second point of view, i.e.,
      materialism, the recognition of objective truth is
      essential. This old philosophical question of the two trends, or
      rather, of the two possible deductions from the premises of
      empiricism and sensationalism, is not solved by Mach, it is not
      eliminated or overcome by him, but is muddled by verbal
      trickery with the word “element,” and the
      like. Bogdanov’s denial of objective truth is an
      inevitable consequence of Machism as a whole, and not a
      deviation from it.
    

Engels in his Ludwig Feuerbach calls Hume and Kant
      philosophers “who question the possibility of any
      cognition, or at least of an exhaustive cognition, of the
      world.” Engels, therefore, lays stress on what is common
      both to Hume and Kant, and not on what divides them. Engels
      states further that “what is decisive in the refutation of
      this [Humean and Kantian] view has already been said by
      Hegel” (4th Germ. ed.,
pp. 15–16).[1] In this connection it
      seems to me not uninteresting to note that Hegel, declaring
      materialism to be “a consistent system of
      empiricism,” wrote: “For empiricism the external
      (das Ausserliche) in general is the truth, and if then
      a supersensible too be admitted, nevertheless knowledge of it
      cannot occur (soll doch eine Erkenntnis desselben
      [d. h. des Uebersinnlichen] nicht stattfinden
      können) and one must keep exclusively to what belongs
      to perception (das der Wahrnehmung
      Angehörige). However, this principle in its
      realisation (Durchführung) produced what was
      subsequently termed materialism. This materialism regards
      matter, as such, as the truly objective (das wahrhaft
      Objektive).”[Hegel, Encyklopädie der
      philosophischen Wissenschaften im Grundrisse [Encyclopaedia of
      the Philosophical Sciences in Outline], Werke,
      VI. Band (1843), S. 83. Cf. S. 122.]
    

All knowledge comes from experience, from sensation, from
      perception. That is true. But the question arises, does
      objective reality “belong to perception,”
      i.e., is it the source of perception? If you answer yes, you are
      a materialist. If you answer no, you are inconsistent and will
      inevitably arrive at subjectivism, or agnosticism, irrespective

    

of whether you deny the knowability of the thing-in-itself, or
      the objectivity of time, space and causality (with Kant), or
      whether you do not even permit the thought of a thing-in-itself
      (with Hume). The inconsistency of your empiricism, of your
      philosophy of experience, will in that case lie in the fact that
      you deny the objective content of experience, the objective
      truth of experimental knowledge.
    

Those who hold to the line of Kant or Hume (Mach and Avenarius
      are among the latter, in so far as they are not pure
      Berkeleians) call us, the materialists,
      “metaphysicians” because we recognise objective
      reality which is given us in experience, because we recognise an
      objective source of our sensations independent of man. We
      materialists follow Engels in calling the Kantians and Humeans
      agnostics, because they deny objective reality as the
      source of our sensations. Agnostic is a Greek word: a
      in Greek means “no,” gnosis
      “knowledge.” The agnostic says: I do not
      know if there is an objective reality which is reflected,
      imaged by our sensations; I declare there is no way of knowing
      this (see the words of Engels above quoted setting forth the
      position of the agnostic). Hence the denial of objective truth
      by the agnostic, and the tolerance—the philistine,
      cowardly tolerance—of the dogmas regarding sprites,
      hobgoblins, Catholic saints, and the like. Mach and Avenarius,
      pretentiously resorting to a “new” terminology, a
      supposedly “new” point of view, repeat, in fact,
      although in a confused and muddled way, the reply of the
      agnostic: on the one hand, bodies are complexes of sensations
      (pure subjectivism, pure Berkeleianism); on the other hand, if
      we re-christen our sensations “elements,” we may
      think of them as existing independently of our sense-organs!
    

The Machians love to declaim that they are philosophers who
      completely trust the evidence of our sense-organs, who regard
      the world as actually being what it seems to us to be, full of
      sounds, colours, etc., whereas to the materialists, they say,
      the world is dead, devoid of sound and colour, and in its
      reality different from what it seems to be, and so forth. Such
      declamations, for example, are indulged in by J. Petzoldt, both
      in his Introduction to the Philosophy of Pure Experience and
      in his World Problem from the Positivist

    

Standpoint
      (1906). Petzoldt is parroted by Mr. Victor Chernov, who waxes
      enthusiastic over the “new” idea. But, in fact, the
      Machians are subjectivists and agnostics, for they do not
      sufficiently trust the evidence of our sense-organs and
      are inconsistent in their sensationalism. They do not recognise
      objective reality, independent of man, as the source of our
      sensations. They do not regard sensations as a true copy of this
      objective reality, thereby directly conflicting with natural
      science and throwing the door open for fideism. On the contrary,
      for the materialist the world is richer, livelier, more varied
      than it actually seems, for with each step in the development of
      science new aspects are discovered. For the materialist,
      sensations are images of the sole and ultimate objective
      reality, ultimate not in the sense that it has already been
      explored to the end, but in the sense that there is not and
      cannot be any other. This view irrevocably closes the door not
      only to every species of fideism, but also to that professorial
      scholasticism which, while not recognising an objective reality
      as the source of our sensations, “deduces” the
      concept of the objective by means of such artificial verbal
      constructions as universal significance, socially-organised, and
      so on and so forth, and which is unable, and frequently
      unwilling, to separate objective truth from belief in sprites
      and hobgoblins.
    

The Machians contemptuously shrug their shoulders at the
      “antiquated” views of the “dogmatists,”
      the materialists, who still cling to the concept
      matter, which supposedly has been refuted by
      “recent science” and “recent
      positivism.” We shall speak separately of the new theories
      of physics on the structure of matter. But it is absolutely
      unpardonable to confound, as the Machians do, any particular
      theory of the structure of matter with the epistemological
      category, to confound the problem of the new properties of new
      aspects of matter (electrons, for example) with the old problem
      of the theory of knowledge, with the problem of the sources of
      our knowledge, the existence of objective truth, etc. We are
      told that Mach “discovered the world-elements”: red,
      green, hard, soft, loud, long, etc. We ask, is a man given
      objective reality when he sees something red or feels something
      hard, etc., or

    

not? This hoary philosophical query is confused
      by Mach. If you hold that it is not given, you, together with
      Mach, inevitably sink to subjectivism and agnosticism and
      deservedly fall into the embrace of the immanentists, i.e., the
      philosophical Menshikovs. If you hold that it is given, a
      philosophical concept is needed for this objective reality, and
      this concept has been worked out long, long ago. This concept is
      matter. Matter is a philosophical category denoting the
      objective reality which is given to man by his sensations, and
      which is copied, photographed and reflected by our sensations,
      while existing independently of them. Therefore, to say that
      such a concept can become “antiquated” is
      childish talk, a senseless repetition of the arguments
      of fashionable reactionary philosophy. Could the
      struggle between materialism and idealism, the struggle between
      the tendencies or lines of Plato and Democritus in philosophy,
      the struggle between religion and science, the denial of
      objective truth and its assertion, the struggle between the
      adherents of supersensible knowledge and its adversaries have
      become antiquated during the two thousand years of the
      development of philosophy?
    

Acceptance or rejection of the concept matter is a question of
      the confidence man places in the evidence of his sense-organs, a
      question of the source of our knowledge, a question which has
      been asked and debated from the very inception of philosophy,
      which may be disguised in a thousand different garbs by
      professorial clowns, but which can no more become antiquated
      than the question whether the source of human knowledge is sight
      and touch, healing and smell. To regard our sensations as images
      of the external world, to recognise objective truth, to hold the
      materialist theory of knowledge—these are all one and the
      same thing. To illustrate this, I shall only quote from
      Feuerbach and from two textbooks of philosophy, in order that
      the reader may judge how elementary this question is.
    

      “How banal,” wrote Feuerbach, “to deny that
      sensation is the evangel, the gospel (Verkündung)
      of an objective saviour.”[Feuerbach, Sämtliche
      Werke, X. Band, 1866, S. 194-95.] A strange, a preposterous
      terminology, as you see, but a perfectly clear philosophical
      line: sensation reveals

    

objective truth to man. “My
      sensation is subjective, but its foundation [or
      ground—Grund] is objective”
      (S. 195). Compare this with the quotation given above where
      Feuerbach says that materialism starts from the perceptual world
      as an ultimate (ausgemachte) objective truth.
    

Sensationalism, we read in Franck’s dictionary of
      philosophy,[Dictionnaire des sciences philosophiques
      [Dictionary of the Philosophical Sciences], Paris, 1875.]
      is a doctrine which deduces all our ideas “from the
      experience of sense-organs, reducing all knowledge to
      sensations.” There is subjective sensationalism
      (scepticism and Berkeleianism), moral sensationalism
      (Epicureanism),[2] and objective
      sensationalism. “Objective sensationalism is nothing but
      materialism, for matter or bodies are, in the opinion of the
      materialists, the only objects that can affect our senses
      (atteindre nos sens).”
    

      “If sensationalism,” says Schwegler in his history
      of philosophy,[Dr. Albert Schwegler, Geschichte der
      Philosophie im Umriss [Outline History of Philosophy],
      15-te Aufl., S. 194.] “asserted that truth or being can be
      apprehended exclusively by means of the senses, one had only
      [Schwegler is speaking of philosophy at the end of the
      eighteenth century in France] to formulate this proposition
      objectively and one had the thesis of materialism: only the
      perceptual exists; there is no other being save material
      being.”    

These elementary truths, which have managed to find their way
      even into the textbooks, have been forgotten by our Machians.

      F. Engels, Luduwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German
      Philosophy (K. Marx and F. Engels, Selected Works,
      Volume II, Moscow, 1958, p. 371).
    



[2]
Scepticism—a philosophical trend that casts doubt on
      the possibility of knowing objective reality. It arose in
      ancient Greece as early as the 4th to 3rd centuries
      B. C. (Pyrrho, Aenesidemus, Sextus Empiricus). The adherents of
      ancient scepticism drew agnostic conclusions from the premises
      of sensationalism, Making the subjectivity of sensation into an
      absolute, the sceptics insisted on the need to refrain from any
      definite judgments about things. They considered that ,man
      cannot go beyond his sensations and determine their truth.


During the period of the Renaissance, the French philosophers
      Michel Montaigne, Pierre Charron and Pierre Bayle made use of
      scepticism for combating medieval scholasticism and the Church.
    

In the eighteenth century scepticism was revived in the
      agnosticism of I-fume an(l Kant, and an attempt to modernise
      ancient scepticism was made by Gottlieb Schulze
      (Aenesideinus). The arguments of scepticism were used by the
      Machists, neo-Kantians and other idealist philosophical schools
      from the middle of the nineteenth to the beginning of the
      twentieth century.
    

Epicureanism the doctrine of the ancient Greek
      philosopher Epicurus of the 4th to 3rd centuries B. C. and his
      successors. The aim of philosophy, according to this doctrine,
      was man’s happiness; freeing him from suffering and enabling him
      to attain a state of bliss. It taught that philosophy was called
      upon to over come obstacles to happiness: the fear of death due
      to ignorance of the laws of nature and giving rise therefore to
      belief in super natural, divine forces.
    

As regards the theory of knowledge, Epicurus was a
      sensationalist. He supposed that very subtle images proceed from
      things and penetrate the human soul through the
      sense-organs. Conceptions of things are formed on the basis of
      the sensuous perceptions of the soul, in which memory preserves
      only the general features of images. Epicurus regarded
      sense-perceptions themselves as the criterion of truth, and he
      considered that the source of errors lay in the accidental
      character of individual sensations or in the over-hasty
      formation of judgments.
    


The idealists, who distorted the teaching of this great
      materialist of ancient Greece, made more attacks on Epicureanism
      than on the other philosophical theories of antiquity.
    

In the definition of sensationalism quoted by Lenin, Franck
      rightly regards Epicureanism as a variety of it, but he draws an
      incorrect distinction between Epicureanism and objective
      materialist sensationalism.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Two: The Theory of Knowledge of Empirio-Criticism and of Dialectical Materialism. II )
5. Absolute and Relative Truth, or the
    Eclecticism of Engels
    as Discovered by A. Bogdanov

Bogdanov made his discovery in 1906, in the preface to Book III
      of his Empirio-Monism. “Engels in
      Anti-Dühring,” writes Bogdanov,
      “expresses himself almost in the same sense in which I
      have just described the relativity of truth”
      (p. v)—that is, in the sense of denying all eternal truth,
      “denying the unconditional objectivity of all truth
      whatsoever.” “Engels is wrong in his indecision, in
      the fact that in spite of his irony he recognises certain
      ‘eternal truths,’ wretched though they may
      be. . .” (p. viii). “Only inconsistency

    

can here
      permit such eclectic reservations as those of Engels. . .”
      (p. ix). Let us cite one instance of Bogdanov’s refutation
      of Engels’ eclecticism. “Napoleon died on May 5,
      1821,” says Engels in Anti-Dühring, in the
      chapter “Eternal Truths,” where he reminds
      Dühring of the “platitudes”
      (Plattheiten) to which he who claims to discover
      eternal truths in the historical sciences has to confine
      himself. Bogdanov thus answers Engels: “What sort of
      ‘truth’ is that? And what is there
      ‘eternal’ about it? The recording of a single
      correlation, which perhaps even has no longer any real
      significance for our generation, cannot serve as a basis for any
      activity, and leads nowhere” (p. ix). And on page viii:
      “Can Plattheiten be called Wahrheiten?
      Are ‘platitudes’ truths? Truth is a vital organising
      form of experience; it leads us somewhere in our activity and
      provides a point of support in the struggle of life.”
    

It is quite clear from these two quotations that Bogdanov,
      instead of refuting Engels, makes a mere
      declamation. If you cannot assert that the proposition
      “Napoleon died on May 5, 1821,” is false or inexact,
      you acknowledge that it is true. If you do not assert that it
      may be refuted in the future, you acknowledge this truth to be
      eternal. But to call phrases such as truth is a “vital
      organising form of experience” an answer, is to palm off a
      mere jumble of words as philosophy. Did the earth have
      the history which is expounded in geology, or was the earth
      created in seven days? Is one to be allowed to dodge this
      question by Is one to be allowed to dodge this question by
      talking about “vital” (’what does that mean?)
      truth which “leads” somewhere, and the like? Can it
      be that knowledge of the history of the earth and of the history
      of humanity “has no real significance”? This is just
      turgid nonsense, used by Bogdanov to cover his re treat. For it
      is a retreat, when, having taken it upon himself to prove that
      the admission of eternal truths by Engels is eclecticism, he
      dodges the issue by a mere noise and clash of words and leaves
      unrefuted the fact that Napoleon did die on May 5, 1821, and
      that to regard this truth as refutable in the future is absurd.
    

The example given by Engels is elementary, and anybody without
      the slightest difficulty can think of scores of similar truths
      that are eternal and absolute and that only insane people can
      doubt (as Engels says, citing another example:

    

“Paris is
      in France”). Why does Engels speak here of
      “platitudes”? Because he refutes and ridicules the
      dogmatic, metaphysical materialist Dühring, who was incapable
      of applying dialectics to the relation between absolute and
      relative truth. To be a materialist is to acknowledge objective
      truth, which is revealed to us by our sense-organs. To
      acknowledge objective truth, i.e., truth not dependent upon man
      and mankind, is, in one Way or another, to recognise absolute
      truth. And it is this “one way or another” which
      distinguishes the metaphysical materialist Dühring from the
      dialectical materialist Engels. On the most complex questions of
      science in general, and of historical science in particular,
      Dühring scattered words right and left: ultimate, final and
      eternal truth. Engels jeered at him. Of course there are eternal
      truths, Engels said, but it is unwise to use high-sounding words
      (gewaltige Worte) in connection with simple things. If
      we want to advance materialism, we must drop this trite play
      with the words “eternal truth”; we must learn to
      put, and answer, the question of the relation between absolute
      and relative truth dialectically. It was on this issue that the
      fight between Dühring and Engels was waged thirty years
      ago. And Bogdanov, who managed “not to notice”
      Engels’ explanation of the problem of absolute and
      relative truth given in this very same chapter, and who
      managed to accuse Engels of “eclecticism” for his
      admission of a proposition which is a truism for all
      forms of materialism, only once again betrays his utter
      ignorance of both materialism and dialectics.
    

      “Now we come to the question,” Engels writes in
      Anti-Dühring, in the beginning of the chapter mentioned
      (Part I, Chap. IX), “whether any, and if so which,
      products of human knowledge ever can have sovereign validity and
      an unconditional claim (Anspruch) to truth” (5th
      German ed., p. 79). And Engels answers the question thus:
    

      “The sovereignty of thought is realised in a number of
      extremely unsovereignly-thinking human beings; the knowledge
      which has an unconditional claim to truth is realised in a
      number of relative errors; neither the one nor the other [i.e.,
      neither absolutely true knowledge, nor sovereign thought] can be
      fully realised except through an endless eternity of human
      existence.
    
 

      “Here once again we find the same contradiction as we
      found above, between the character of human thought, necessarily
      conceived as absolute, and its reality in individual human
      beings with their extremely limited thought. This is a
      contradiction which can only be solved in the infinite
      progression, or what is for us, at least from a practical
      standpoint, the endless succession, of generations of
      mankind. In this sense human thought is just as much sovereign
      as not sovereign, and its capacity for knowledge just as much un
      limited as limited. It is sovereign and unlimited in its
      disposition (Anlage), its vocation, its possibilities
      and its historical ultimate goal; it is not sovereign and it is
      limited in its individual expression and in its realisation at
      each particular moment” (p. 81).[Cf. V. Chernov,
      loc. cit., p. 64, et seq. Chernov,
      the Machian, fully shares the position of Bogdanov who does not
      wish to own himself a Machian. The difference is that Bogdanov
      tries to cover up his disagreement with Engels, to
      present it as a casual matter, etc., while Chernov feels that it
      is a question of a struggle against both materialism and
      dialectics.]
    

      “It is just the same,” Engels continues, “with
      eternal
truths.”[1]


This argument is extremely important for the question of
      relativism, i.e., the principle of the relativity of
      our knowledge, which is stressed by all Machians. The Machians
      one and all insist that they are relativists, but the
      Russian Machians, while repeating the words of the Germans, are
      afraid, or unable to propound the question of the relation of
      relativism to dialectics clearly and straightforwardly. For
      Bogdanov (as for all the Machians) recognition of the relativity
      of our knowledge excludes even the least admission of
      absolute truth. For Engels absolute truth is compounded from
      relative truths. Bogdanov is a relativist; Engels is a
      dialectician. Here is another, no less important, argument of
      Engels from the chapter of Anti-Dühring already
      quoted:
    

      “Truth and error, like all thought-concepts which move in
      polar opposites, have absolute validity only in an extremely
      limited field, as we have just seen, and as even Herr
      Dühring would realise if he had any acquaintance with the
      first elements of dialectics, which deal precisely with the
      inadequacy of all polar opposites. As soon as we apply

    

the
      antithesis between truth and error outside of that narrow field
      which has been referred to above it becomes relative and
      therefore unserviceable for exact scientific modes of
      expression; and if we attempt to apply it as absolutely valid
      outside that field we really find ourselves altogether beaten:
      both poles of the antithesis become transformed into their
      opposites, truth becomes error and error truth”
      (p. 86).[2] Here follows the example of
      Boyle’s law (the volume of a gas is inversely proportional
      to its pressure). The “grain of truth” contained in
      this law is only absolute truth within certain limits. The law,
      it appears, is a truth “only approximately.”
    

Human thought then by its nature is capable of giving, and does
      give, absolute truth, which is compounded of a sum-total of
      relative truths. Each step in the development of science adds
      new grains to the sum of absolute truth, but the limits of the
      truth of each scientific proposition are relative, now
      expanding, now shrinking with the growth of
      knowledge. “Absolute truth,” says J. Dietzgen in his
      Excursions,— “can be seen, heard, smelt,
      touched and, of course, also be known, but it is not
      entirely absorbed (geht nicht auf) into
      knowledge” (p. 195). “It goes without saying that a
      picture does not exhaust its object and the artist remains
      behind his model. . . . How can a picture ‘coincide’
      with its model? Approximately it can”
      (p. 197). “Hence, we can know nature and her parts only
      relatively; since even a part, though only a relation of nature,
      possesses nevertheless the nature of the absolute, the nature of
      nature as a whole (des Naturganzen an sich) which
      cannot be exhausted by knowledge. . . . How, then, do we know
      that behind the phenomena of nature, behind the relative truths,
      there is a universal, unlimited, absolute nature which does not
      reveal itself to man completely? . . . Whence this knowledge? It
      is innate; it is given us with consciousness”
      (p. 198). This last statement is one of the inexactitudes of
      Dietzgen’s which led Marx, in one of his letters to
      Kugelmann, to speak of the confusion in Dietzgen’s
      views.[3] Only by seizing upon such incorrect
      passages can one speak of a specific philosophy of Dietzgen
      differing from dialectical materialism. But Dietzgen corrects
      himself on the same page : “When I say that the
      consciousness of eternal, absolute truth is innate in us,

    

that
      it is the one and only a priori knowledge, experience
      also confirms this innate consciousness” (p. 198).
    

From all these statements by Engels and Dietzgen it is obvious
      that for dialectical materialism there is no impassable boundary
      between relative and absolute truth. Bogdanov entirely failed to
      grasp this if he could write: “It [the world outlook of
      the old materialism] sets itself up as the absolute
      objective knowledge of the essence of things
      [Bogdanov’s italics] and is incompatible with the
      historically conditional nature of all ideologies”
      (Empirio-Monism, Bk. III, p. iv). From the standpoint
      of modern materialism i.e., Marxism, the limits of
      approximation of our knowledge to objective, absolute truth are
      historically conditional, but the existence of such truth is
      unconditional, and the fact that we are approaching
      nearer to it is also unconditional. The contours of the picture
      are historically conditional, but the fact that this picture
      depicts an objectively existing model is unconditional. When and
      under what circumstances we reached, in our knowledge of the
      essential nature of things, the discovery of alizarin in coal
      tar or the discovery of electrons in the atom is historically
      conditional; but that every such discovery is an advance of
      “absolutely objective knowledge” is
      unconditional. In a word, every ideology is historically
      conditional, but it is unconditionally true that to every
      scientific ideology (as distinct, for instance, from religious
      ideology), there corresponds an objective truth, absolute
      nature. You will say that this distinction between relative and
      absolute truth is indefinite. And I shall reply: yes, it is
      sufficiently “indefinite” to prevent science from
      becoming a dogma in the bad sense of the term, from becoming
      something dead, frozen, ossified; but it is at the same time
      sufficiently “definite” to enable us to dissociate
      ourselves in the most emphatic and irrevocable manner from
      fideism and agnosticism, from philosophical idealism and the
      sophistry of the followers of Hume and Kant. Here is a boundary
      which you have not noticed, and not having noticed it, you have
      fallen into the swamp of reactionary philosophy. It is the
      boundary between dialectical materialism and relativism.
    

We are relativists, proclaim Mach, Avenarius, Petzoldt. We are
      relativists, echo Mr. Chernov and certain Russian

    

Machians,
      would-be Marxists. Yes, Mr. Chernov and Comrades
      Machians—and therein lies your error. For to make
      relativism the basis of the theory of knowledge is inevitably to
      condemn oneself either to absolute scepticism, agnosticism and
      sophistry, or to subjectivism. Relativism as a basis of the
      theory of knowledge is not only the recognition of the
      relativity of our knowledge, but also a denial of any objective
      measure or model existing independently of humanity to which our
      relative knowledge approximates. From the standpoint of naked
      relativism one can justify any sophistry; one may regard it as
      “conditional” whether Napoleon died on May 5, 1821,
      or not; one may declare the admission, alongside of scientific
      ideology (“convenient” in one respect), of religious
      ideology (very “convenient” in another respect) a
      mere “convenience” for man or humanity, and so
      forth.
    

Dialectics—as Hegel in his time
      explained—contains the element of relativism, of
      negation, of scepticism, but is not reducible to
      relativism. The materialist dialectics of Marx and Engels
      certainly does contain relativism, but is not reducible to
      relativism, that is, it recognises the relativity of all our
      knowledge, not in the sense of denying objective truth, but in
      the sense that the limits of approximation of our knowledge to
      this truth are historically conditional.
    

Bogdanov writes in italics: “Consistent Marxism does
      not admit such dogmatism and such static concepts”
      as eternal truths. (Empirio-Monism, Bk. III, p. ix.)
      This is a muddle. If the world is eternally moving and
      developing matter (as the Marxists think), reflected by the
      developing human consciousness, what is there
      “static” here? The point at issue is not the
      immutable essence of things, or an immutable consciousness, but
      the correspondence between the consciousness which
      reflects nature and the nature which is reflected by
      consciousness. In connection with this question, and this
      question alone, the term “dogmatism” has a specific,
      characteristic philosophical flavour: it is a favourite word
      used by the idealists and the agnostics against the
      materialists, as we have already seen in the case of the fairly
      “old” materialist, Feuerbach. The objections brought
      against materialism from the standpoint of the celebrated
      “recent positivism” are just ancient trash.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Two: The Theory of Knowledge of Empirio-Criticism and of Dialectical Materialism. II )
6. The Criterion of Practice in the Theory
of Knowledge

We have seen that Marx in 1845 and Engels in 1888 and 1892
      placed the criterion of practice at the basis of the materialist
      theory of
knowledge.[1] “The dispute over the reality or
      non-reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a
      purely scholastic question,” says Marx in his second
      Thesis on Feuerbach. The best refutation of Kantian and Humean
      agnosticism as well as of other philosophical crotchets
      (Schrullen) is practice, repeats Engels. “The
      result of our action proves the conformity
      (Uebereinstimmung) of our perceptions with the
      objective nature of the things perceived,” he says in
      reply to the
agnostics.[2]


Compare this with Mach’s argument about the criterion of
      practice: “In the common way of thinking and speaking
      appearance, illusion, is usually contrasted
      with reality. A pencil held in front of us in the air
      is seen as straight; when we dip it slantwise into water we see
      it as crooked. In the latter case we say that the pencil
      appears crooked but in reality it is straight. But what
      entitles us to declare one fact to be the reality, and
      to degrade the other to an appearance?. . . Our
      expectation is deceived when we fall into the natural error of
      expecting what we are accustomed to although the case is
      unusual. The facts are not to blame for that. In these cases, to
      speak of appearance may have a practical significance,
      but not a scientific significance. Similarly, the question which
      is often asked, whether the world is real or whether we merely
      dream it, is devoid of all scientific significance. Even the
      wildest dream is a fact as much as any other”
      (Analysis of Sensations, pp. 18-19).
    

It is true that not only is the wildest dream a fact, but also
      the wildest philosophy. No doubt of this is possible after an
      acquaintance with the philosophy of Ernst Mach. Egregious
      sophist that he is, he confounds the scientific-historical and
      psychological investigation of human errors, of every
      “wild dream” of humanity, such as belief in sprites,
      hobgoblins, and so forth, with the epistemological distinction
      between truth and “wildness.” It is as if an
      economist were to say that both Senior’s theory that the
      whole profit

    

of the capitalist is obtained from the “last
      hour” of the worker’s labour and Marx’s theory
      are both facts, and that from the standpoint of science there is
      no point in asking which theory expresses objective truth and
      which—the prejudice of the bourgeoisie and the venality of
      its professors. The tanner Joseph Dietzgen regarded the
      scientific, i.e., the materialist, theory of knowledge as a
      “universal weapon against religious belief”
      (Kleinere philosophische Schriften [Smaller Philosophical
      Essays], S. 55), but for the professor-in-ordinary Ernst
      Mach the distinction between the materialist and the
      subjective-idealist theories of knowledge “is devoid of
      all scientific significance”! That science is non partisan
      in the struggle of materialism against idealism and religion is
      a favourite idea not only of Mach but of all modern bourgeois
      professors, who are, as Dietzgen justly expresses it,
      “graduated flunkeys who stupefy the people by their
      twisted idealism” (op. cit., p. 53
    

And a twisted professorial idealism it is, indeed, when the
      criterion of practice, which for every one of us distinguishes
      illusion from reality, is removed by Mach from the realm of
      science, from the realm of the theory of knowledge. Human
      practice proves the correctness of the materialist theory of
      knowledge, said Marx and Engels, who dubbed all attempts to
      solve the fundamental question of epistemology without the aid
      of practice “scholastic” and “philosophical
      crotchets.” But for Mach practice is one thing and the
      theory of knowledge another. They can be placed side by side
      without making the latter conditional on the former. In his last
      work, Knowledge and Error, Mach says: “Knowledge
      is a biologically useful (förderndes) mental
      experience” (2nd Germ. ed., p. 115). “Only success
      can separate knowledge from error” (p. 116). “The
      concept is a physical working hypothesis” (p. 143). In
      their astonishing naïveté our Russian Machian would-be
      Marxists regard such phrases of Mach’s as proof that he
      comes close to Marxism. But Mach here comes just as
      close to Marxism as Bismarck to the labour movement, or Bishop
      Eulogius[3] to democracy. With Mach such
      propositions stand side by side with his idealist
      theory of knowledge and do not determine the choice of one or
      another definite line of epistemology. Knowledge can be useful
      biologically, useful in human practice, useful for the
      preservation of

    

life, for the preservation of the species, only
      when it reflects objective truth, truth which is independent of
      man. For the materialist the “success” of human
      practice proves the correspondence between our ideas and the
      objective nature of the things we perceive. For the solipsist
      “success” is everything needed by me in
      practice, which can be regarded separately from the theory
      of knowledge. If we include the criterion of practice in the
      foundation of the theory of knowledge we inevitably arrive at
      materialism, says the Marxist. Let practice be

      materialist, says Mach, but theory is another matter.
    

      "In practice," Mach writes in the Analysis of
Sensations, "we can as little do without the idea of the
      self when we perform any act, as we can do without the
      idea of a body when we grasp at a thing. Physiologically we
      remain egoists and materialists with the same constancy as we
      forever see the sun rising again. But theoretically this view
      cannot be adhered to" (284-85).
    

Egoism is beside the point here, for egoism is not an
      epistemological cateogry. The question of the appartent movement
      of the sun around the earth is also beside the point, for in
      practice, which serves us as a criterion in the theory of
      knowledge, we must include also the practice of astronomical
      observations, discovereies, etc. There remains only Mach’s
      valuable admission that in their practical life men are entirely
      and exclusively guided by the materialist theory of knowledge;
      the attempt to obviate it "theoretically" is characteristic of
      Mach’s gelehrte scholastic and twisted idealistic endeavours.
          

How little of a novelty are these efforts to eliminate
      practice–as something unsusceptible to epistemological
      treatment–in order to make room for agnosticism and idealism is
      show by the following example from the history of German
      classical philosophy. Between Kan and Fichte stands
      G. E. Schulze (known in the history of philosophy as
      Schulze-Aenesidemus). He openly advocates the skeptical trend in
      philosophy and calls himself a follower of Hume) and

      of the ancients Pyrrho and Sextus). He emphatically rejects
      every thing-in-itself and the possibility of objective
      knowledge, and emphatically insists that we should not go beyond
      “experience,” beyond sensations, in which connection

    

he anticipates the following objection from the other camp:
      “Since the sceptic when he takes part in the affairs of
      life assumes as indubitable the reality of objective things,
      behaves accordingly, and thus admits a criterion of truth, his
      own behaviour is the best and clearest refutation of his
      scepticism.”—[G. E. Schulze, Aenesidemus oder
      über die Fundemente der von dem Herrn Professor Reinhold in
      Jena gelieferten Elementarphilosophie [Aenesidemus, or
      the Fundamentals of the Elementary Philosophy Propounded by
      Professor Reinhold in Jena], 1792, S. 253.] “Such
      proofs,” Schulze indignantly retorts, “are only
      valid for the mob (Pöbel).” For “my
      scepticism does not concern the requirements of practical life,
      but remains within the bounds of philosophy” (pp. 254,
      255).
    

In similar manner, the subjective idealist Fichte also hopes to
      find room within the bounds of idealistic philosophy for that
      “realism which is inevitable (sich aufdringt) for
      all of us, and even for the most determined idealist, when it
      comes to action, i.e., the assumption that objects exist quite
      independently of us and outside us” (Werke, I,
      455).
    

Mach’s recent positivism has not traveled far from
      Schulze and Fichte! Let us note as a curiosity that on this
      question too for Bazarov there is no one but
      Plekhanov—there is no beast stronger than the cat. Bazarov
      ridicules the “salto vitale philosophy of
      Plekhanov” (Studies, etc., p. 69), who indeed
      made the absurd remark that “belief” in the
      existence of the outer world “is an inevitable salto
      vitale” (vital leap) of philosophy (Notes on
      Ludwig Feuerbach, p. III). The word “belief”
      (taken from Hume), although put in quotation marks, discloses a
      confusion of terms on Plekhanov’s part. There can be no
      question about that. But what has Plekhanov got to do with it?
      Why did not Bazarov take some other materialist, Feuerbach, for
      instance? Is it only because he does not know him? But ignorance
      is no argument. Feuerbach also, like Marx and Engels, makes an
      impermissible—from the point of view of Schulze, Fichte
      and Mach—“leap” to practice in the fundamental
      problems of epistemology. Criticising idealism, Feuerbach
      explains its essential nature by the following striking
      quotation from Fichte, which superbly demolishes Machism:
      “‘Youassume,’ writes Fichte, ‘that
      things are real, that they exist outside

    

of you, only because
      you see them, hear them and touch them. But vision, touch and
      hearing are only sensations. . . . You perceive, not the
      objects, but only your sensations’” (Feuerbach,
      Werke, X. Band, S. 185). To which Feuerbach replies
      that a human being is not an abstract ego, but either a man or
      woman, and the question whether the world is sensation can be
      compared to the question: is the man or woman my sensation, or
      do our relations in practical life prove the contrary?
      “This is the, fundamental defect of idealism: it asks and
      answers the question of objectivity and subjectivity, of the
      reality or unreality of the world, only from the standpoint of
      theory” (ibid., p. 189). Feuerbach makes the
      sum-total of human practice the basis of the theory of
      knowledge. He says that idealists of course also recognise the
      reality of the I and the Thou in practical
      life. For the idealists “this point of view is valid only
      for practical life and not for speculation. But a speculation
      which contradicts life, which makes the standpoint of death, of
      a soul separated from the body, the standpoint of truth, is a
      dead and false speculation” (p. 192). Before we
      perceive, we breathe; we cannot exist without air, food
      and drink.
    

      “Does this mean that we must deal with questions of food
      and drink when examining the problem of the ideality or reality
      of the world?—exclaims the indignant idealist. How vile!
      What an offence against good manners soundly to berate
      materialism in the scientific sense from the chair of philosophy
      and the pulpit of theology, only to practise materialism with
      all one’s heart and soul in the crudest form at the table
      d’h(tm)te” (p. 195). And Feuerbach exclaims that to
      identify subjective sensation with the objective world “is
      to identify pollution with procreation” (p. 198).
    

A comment not of the politest order, but it hits the vital spot
      of those philosophers who teach that sense-perception is the
      reality existing outside us.
    

The standpoint of life, of practice, should be first and
      fundamental in the theory of knowledge. And it inevitably leads
      to materialism, brushing aside the endless fabrications of
      professorial scholasticism. Of course, we must not forget that
      the criterion of practice can never, in the nature of things,
      either confirm or refute any human idea
      completely. This criterion also is sufficiently
      “indefinite”

    

not to allow human knowledge to become
      “absolute,” but at the same time it is sufficiently
      definite to wage a ruthless fight on all varieties of idealism
      and agnosticism. If what our practice confirms is the sole,
      ultimate and objective truth, then from this must follow the
      recognition that the only path to this truth is the path of
      science, which holds the materialist point of view. For
      instance, Bogdanov is prepared to recognise Marx’s theory
      of the circulation of money as an objective truth only for
      “our time,” and calls it “dogmatism” to
      at tribute to this theory a “super-historically
      objective” truth (Empirio-Monism, Bk. III,
      p. vii). This is again a muddle. The correspondence of this
      theory to practice cannot be altered by any future
      circumstances, for the same simple reason that makes it an
      eternal truth that Napoleon died on May 5, 1821. But
      inasmuch as the criterion of practice, i.e., the course of
      development of all capitalist countries in the last few
      decades, proves only the objective truth of Marx’s
      whole social and economic theory in general, and not
      merely of one or other of its parts, formulations, etc., it is
      clear that to talk of the “dogmatism” of the
      Marxists is to make an unpardonable concession to bourgeois
      economics. The sole conclusion to be drawn from the opinion of
      the Marxists that Marx’s theory is an objective truth is
      that by following the path of Marxist theory we shall
      draw closer and closer to objective truth (without ever
      exhausting it); but by following any other path we
      shall arrive at nothing but confusion and lies.

Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

 Chapter Three:

The Theory of Knowledge of Dialectical
      Materialism and of Empirio-Criticism. III
 1. What Is Matter? What Is
Experience?
The first of these
      questions is constantly being hurled by the idealists and
      agnostics, including the Machians, at the materialists; the second
      question by the materialists at the Machians. Let us try to make
      the point at issue clear.
    

Avenarius says on the subject of matter:
    

      “Within the purified, ‘complete experience’
      there is nothing
      ‘physical’—‘matter’ in the
      metaphysical absolute conception—for ‘matter’
      according to this conception is only an abstraction; it would be
      the total of the counter-terms abstracted from every central
      term. Just as in the principal co-ordination, that is,
      ‘complete experience,’ a counter-term is
      inconceivable (undenkbar) without a central term, so
      ‘matter’ in the metaphysical absolute conception is
      a complete chimera (Unding)”
      (Bemerkungen [Notes], S. 2, in the journal
      cited, § 119).
    

In all this gibberish one thing is evident, namely, that
      Avenarius designates the physical or matter by the terms
      absolute and metaphysics, for, according to his theory of the
      principal co-ordination (or, in the new way, “complete
      expcrience"), the counter-term is inseparable from the central
      term, the environment from the self; the
      non-self is inseparable from the self (as
      J. G. Fichte said). That this theory is disguised subjective
      idealism we have already shown, and the nature of
      Avenarius’ attacks on “matter”  is quite
      obvious: the idealist denies physical being that is independent
      of the

    

mind and therefore rejects the concept elaborated by
      philosophy for such being. That matter is “physical”
      (i.e.., that which is most familiar and immediately
      given to man, and the existence of which no one save an inmate
      of a lunatic asylum can doubt) is not denied by Avenarius; he
      only insists on the acceptance of “his”
      theory of the indissoluble connection between the environment
      and the self.
    

Mach expresses the same thought more simply, without
      philosophical flourishes: “What we call matter is a
      certain systematic combination of the elements
      (sensations)”  (Analysis of Sensations,
      p. 265). Mach thinks that by this assertion he is effecting a
      “radical change”  in the usual world outlook. In
      reality this is the old, old subjective idealism, the nakedness
      of which is concealed by the word “element.”
    

And lastly, the English Machian, Pearson, a rabid antagonist of
      materialism, says: “Now there can be no scientific
      objection to our classifying certain more or less permanent
      groups of sense-impressions together and terming them
      matter,—to do so indeed leads us very near to John Stuart
      Mill’s definition of matter as a ‘permanent
      possibility of sensation,’—but this definition of
      matter then leads us entirely away from matter as the thing
      which moves”  (The Grammar of Science, 2nd ed.,
      1900, p. 249). Here there is not even the fig-leaf of the
      “elements,”  and the idealist openly stretches out a
      hand to the agnostic.
    

As the reader sees, all these arguments of the founders of
      empirio-criticism entirely and exclusively revolve around the
      old epistemological question of the relation of thinking to
      being, of sensation to the physical. It required the extreme
      naïveté of the Russian Machians to discern anything
      here that is even remotely related to “recent
      science,”  or “recent positivism.”  All the
      philosophers mentioned by us, some frankly, others guardedly,
      replace the fundamental philosophical line of materialism (from
      being to thinking, from matter to sensation) by the reverse line
      of idealism. Their denial of matter is the old answer to
      epistemological problems, which consists in denying the
      existence of an external, objective source of our sensations, of
      an objective reality corresponding to our sensations. On the
      other hand, the recognition of the philosophical line denied by
      the idealists and agnostics is expressed in the definitions:

    

matter is that which, acting upon our sense-organs, produces
      sensation; matter is the objective reality given to us in
      sensation, and so forth.
    

Bogdanov, pretending to argue only against Beltov and cravenly
      ignoring Engels, is indignant at such definitions, which,
      don’t you see, “prove to be simple
      repetitions”  (Empirio-Monism, Bk. III, p. xvi)
      of the “formula”  (of Engels, our
      “Marxist”  forgets to add) that for one trend in
      philosophy matter is primary and spirit secondary, while for the
      other trend the reverse is the case. All the Russian Machians
      exultantly echo Bogdanov’s “refutation"! But the
      slightest reflection could have shown these people that it is
      impossible, in the very nature of the case, to give any
      definition of these two ultimate concepts of epistemology save
      one that indicates which of them is taken as primary. What is
      meant by giving a “definition"? It means essentially to
      bring a given concept within a more comprehensive concept. For
      example, when I give the definition “an ass is an
      animal,”  I am bringing the concept “ass”
      within a more comprehensive concept. The question then is, are
      there more comprehensive concepts, with which the theory of
      knowledge could operate, than those of being and thinking,
      matter and sensation, physical and mental? No. These are the
      ultimate concepts, the most comprehensive concepts which
      epistemology has in point of fact so far not surpassed (apart
      from changes in nomenclature, which are always
      possible). One must be a charlatan or an utter blockhead to
      demand a “definition”  of these two
      “series”  of concepts of ultimate comprehensiveness
      which would not be a “mere repetition": one or the other
      must be taken as the primary. Take the three afore-mentioned
      arguments on matter. What do they all amount to? To this, that
      these philosophers proceed from the mental or the self,
      to the physical, or environment, as from the central term to the
      counter-term—or from sensation to matter, or from
      sense-perception to matter. Could Avenarius, Mach and Pearson in
      fact have given any other “definition”  of these
      fundamental concepts, save by pointing to the trend of
      their philosophical line? Could they have defined in any other
      way, in any specific way, what the self is, what
      sensation is, what sense-perception is? One has only to
      formulate the question clearly to realise what utter non-sense

    

the Machians are talking when they demand that the materialists
      give a definition of matter which would not amount to a
      repetition of the proposition that matter, nature, being, the
      physical—is primary, and spirit, consciousness, sensation,
      the psychical—is secondary.
    

One expression of the genius of Marx and Engels was that they
      despised pedantic playing with new words, erudite terms, and
      subtle “isms,”  and said simply and plainly: there
      is a materialist line and an idealist line in philosophy, and
      between them there are various shades of agnosticism. The
      painful quest for a “new”  point of view in
      philosophy betrays the same poverty of mind that is revealed in
      the painful effort to create a “new”  theory of
      value, or a “new”  theory of rent, and so forth.
    

Of Avenarius, his disciple Carstanjen says that he once
      expressed himself in private conversation as follows: “I
      know neither the physical nor the mental, but only some
      third.”  To the remark of one writer that the concept of
      this third was not given by Avenarius, Petzoldt replied:
      “We know why he could not advance such a concept. The
      third lacks a counter-concept (Gegenbegriff). . . . The
      question, what is the third? is illogically put”
      (Einf.
      i.d.
      Ph. d. r. E., II, 329).[Einführung in die Philosophie der reinen
      Erfahrung [Introduction to the Philosophy of Pure
      Experience], Vol. II, p. 329. –Ed]
      Petzoldt understands that an ultimate concept cannot be
      defined. But he does not understand that the resort to a
      “third”  is a mere subterfuge, for every one of us
      knows what is physical and what is mental, but none of us knows
      at present what that “third”  is. Avenarius was
      merely covering up his tracks by this subterfuge and
      actually was declaring that the self is the
      primary (central term) and nature (environment) the secondary
      (counter-term).
    

Of course, even the antithesis of matter and mind has absolute
      significance only within the bounds of a very limited
      field—in this case exclusively within the bounds of the
      fundamental epistemological problem of what is to be regarded as
      primary and what as secondary. Beyond these bounds the relative
      character of this antithesis is indubitable.
    

Let us now examine how the word “experience”  is
      used in empirio-critical philosophy. The first paragraph of
      The Critique of Pure Experience expounds the following
      “assumption":

    

“Any part of our environment stands in
      relation to human individuals in such a way that, the former
      having been given, the latter speak of their experience as
      follows: ‘this is experienced,’ ‘this is an
      experience’; or ‘it followed from experience,’
      or ‘it depends upon experience.’”
  (Russ. trans., p. 1.) Thus experience is defined in terms of
      these same concepts: self and environment; while the
      “doctrine”  of their “indissoluble”
      connection is for the time being tucked out of the way. Further:
      “The synthetic concept of pure experience"—namely,
      experience “as a predication for which, in all its
      components, only parts of the environment serve as a
      premise”  (pp. 1 and 2). If we assume that the environment
      exists independently of “declarations”  and
      “predications”  of man, then it becomes possible to
      interpret experience in a materialist way! “The analytical
      concept of pure experience"—"namely, as a predication to
      which noth ing is admixed that would not be in its turn
      experience and which, therefore, in itself is nothing but
      experience”  (p. 2). Experience is experience. And there
      are people who take this quasi-erudite rigmarole for true
      wisdom!
    

It is essential to add that in the second volume of The
      Critique of Pure Experience Avenarius regards
      “experience”  as a “special case”  of
      the mental; that he divides experience into
      sachhafte Werte (thing-values) and gedankenhafte
      Werte (thought-values); that “experience in the broad
      sense”  includes the latter; that “complete
      experience”  is identified with the principal
      co-ordination (Bemerkungen). In short, you pay your
      money and take your choice. “Experience”  embraces
      both the materialist and the idealist line in philosophy and
      sanctifies the muddling of them. But while our Machians
      confidingly accept “pure experience”  as pure coin
      of the realm, in philosophical literature the representatives of
      the various trends are alike in pointing to Avenarius’
      abuse of this concept. “What pure experience is,”
      A. Riehl writes, “remains vague with Avenarius, and his
      explanation that ‘pure experience is experience to which
      nothing is admixed that is not in its turn experience’
      obviously revolves in a circle”  (Systematische
      Philosophie [Systematic Philosopby], Leipzig,
      1907, S. 102). Pure experience for Avenarius, writes Wundt, is
      at times any kind of fantasy, and at others, a predication

    

with
      the character of “corporeality”  (Philosophische
      Studien, XIII. Band, S. 92-93). Avenarius
      stretches the concept experience (S. 382). “On
      the precise definition of the terms experience and pure
      experience,”  writes Cauwelaert, “depends the
      meaning of the whole of this philosophy. Avenarius does not give
      a precise definition”  (Revue
      néo-scolastique, fevrier 1907, p. 61). “The
      vagueness of the term ‘experience’ stands him in
      good stead, and so in the end Avenarius falls back on the
      timeworn argument of subjective idealism”  (under the
      pretence of combating it), says Norman Smith (Mind,
      Vol. XV, p. 29).
    

      “I openly declare that the inner sense, the soul of my
      philosophy consists in this that a human being possesses nothing
      save experience; a human being comes to everything to which he
      comes only through experience. . . .”  A zealous
      philosopher of pure experience, is he not? The author of these
      words is the subjective idealist Fichte (Sonnenklarer
      Bericht, usw., S. 12). We know from the history of
      philosophy that the interpretation of the concept experience
      divided the classical materialists from the idealists. Today
      professorial philosophy of all shades disguises its reactionary
      nature by declaiming on the subject of “experience.”
      All the immanentists fall back on experience. In the preface to
      the second edition of his Knowledge and Error, Mach
      praises a book by Professor Wilhelm Jerusalem in which we read:
      “The acceptance of a divine original being is not
      contradictory to experience”  (Der kritische
      Idealismus und die reine Logik [Critical Idealism and
      Pure Logic], S. 222).
    

One can only commiserate with people who believed Avenarius and
      Co. that the “obsolete”  distinction between
      materialism and idealism can be surmounted by the word
      “experience.”  When Valentinov and Yushkevich accuse
      Bogdanov, who departed somewhat from pure Machism, of abusing
      the word experience, these gentlemen are only betraying their
      ignorance. Bogdanov is “not guilty”  in this case;
      he only slavishly borrowed the muddle of Mach and
      Avenarius. When Bogdanov says that “consciousness and
      immediate mental experience are identical concepts”
      (Empirio-Monism, Bk. II, p. 53) while matter is
      “not experience”  but “the unknown which
      evokes everything known”  (Empirio-Monism,
      Bk. III, p. xiii), he is interpreting experience
      idealistically.

    

And, of course, he is not the
first[1]
[1]
In England Comrade Belfort Bax has been
      exercising himsclf in this way for a long time. A French
      reviewer of his book, The Roots of Reality, rather
      bitingly remarked: experience is only another word for
      consciousness"; then come forth as an open idealist! (Revue
      de
philosophie,[2] 1907, No. 10, p. 399).
—Lenin


nor the
      last to build petty idealist systems on the word
      experience. When he replies to the reactionary philosophers by
      declaring that attempts to transcend the boundaries of
      experience lead in fact “only to empty abstractions and
      contradictory images, all the elements of which have
      nevertheless been taken from experience”  (Bk. I, p. 48),
      he is drawing a contrast between the empty abstractions of the
      human mind and that which exists outside of man and
      independently of his mind, in other words, he is interpreting
      experience as a materialist.
    

Similarly, even Mach, although he makes idealism his starting
      point (bodies are complexes of sensations or “elements")
      frequently strays into a materialist interpretation of the word
      experience. “We must not philosophise out of ourselves
      (nicht aus uns herausphilosophieren), but must take
      from experience,”  he says in the Mechanik (3rd
      Germ. ed., 1897, p. 14). Here a contrast is drawn between
      experience and philosophising out of ourselves, in other words,
      experience is regarded as something objective, something given
      to man from the outside; it is interpreted
      materialistically. Here is another example: “What we
      observe in nature is imprinted, although uncomprehended and
      unanalysed, upon our ideas, which, then, in their most general
      and strongest (stärksten) features imitate
      (nachahmen) the processes of nature. In these
      experiences we possess a treasure-store (Schatz) which
      is ever to hand. . .”  (op. cit.,
      p. 27). Here nature is taken as primary and sensation and
      experience as products. Had Mach consistently adhered to this
      point of view in the fundamental questions of epistemology, he
      would have spared humanity many foolish idealist
      “complexes.”  A third example: “The close
      connection of thought and experience creates modern natural
      science. Experience gives rise to a thought. The latter is
      further elaborated and is again compared with experience”
      (Erkenntnis und Irrtum, S. 200). Mach’s special
      “philosophy”

    

is here thrown overboard, and the
      author instinctively accepts the customary standpoint of the
      scientists, who regard experience materialistically.
    

To summarise: the word “experience,”  on which the
      Machians build their systems, has long been serving as a shield
      for idealist systems, and is now serving Avenarius and Co. in
      eclectically passing to and fro between the idealist position
      and the materialist position. The various
      “definitions”  of this concept are only expressions
      of those two fundamental lines in philosophy which were so
      strikingly revealed by Engels.

Lenin: 1908/mec: 2. Plekhanov's Error Concerning The Concept 'Experience'







V. I.  

      Lenin
MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Three: The Theory of Knowledge of Dialectical Materialism and of Empirio-Criticism. III )
2. Plekhanov’s Error Concerning The
Concept “Experience”

On pages x-xi of his introduction to L. Feuerbach (1905
      ed.) Plekhanov says:
    

      “One German writer has remarked that for empirio-criticism
      experience is only an object of investigation, and not
      a means of knowledge. If that is so, then the distinction
      between empirio-criticism and materialism loses all meaning, and
      discussion of the question whether or not empirio-criticism is
      destined to replace materialism is absolutely shallow and
      idle.”
    

This is one complete muddle.
    

Fr. Carstanjen, one of the most “orthodox”
      followers of Avenarius, says in his article on empirio-criticism
      (a reply to Wundt), that “for The Critique of Pure
      Experience experience is not a means of knowledge but only
      an object of
investigation."[1]

It follows that according to Plekhanov any
      distinction between the views of Fr. Carstanjen and materialism
      is meaningless!
    

Fr. Carstanjen is almost literally quoting Avenarius, who in his
      Notes emphatically contrasts his conception of
      experience as that which is given us, that which we find
      (das Vorgefundene), with the conception of experience
      as a “means of knowledge”  in “the sense of
      the prevailing theories of knowledge, which essentially are
      fully metaphysical”  (op. cit.,
      p. 401). Petzoldt, following Avenarius, says the

    

same thing in
      his Introduction to the Philosophy of Pure Experience
      (Bd. I, S. 170). Thus, according to Plekhanov, the distinction
      between the views of Carstanjen, Avenarius, Petzoldt and
      materialism is meaningless! Either Plekhanov has not read
      Carstanjen and Co. as thoroughly as he should, or he has taken
      his reference to “a German writer”  at fifth hand.
    

What then does this statement, uttered by some of the most
      prominent empirio-criticists and not understood by Plekhanov,
      mean? Carstanjen wishes to say that Avenarius in his The
      Critique of Pure Experience takes experience,
      i.e.., all “human predications,”  as the
      object of investigation. Avenarius does not investigate
      here, says Carstanjen (op. cit., p. 50),
      whether these predications are real, or whether they relate, for
      example, to ghosts; he merely arranges, systematises, formally
      classifies all possible human predications, both idealist
      and materialist (p. 53), without going into the essence of
      the question. Carstanjen is absolutely right when he
      characterises this point of view as “scepticism
      par excellence”  (p. 213). In this article, by the way,
      Carstanjen defends his beloved master from the ignominious (for
      a German professor) charge of materialism levelled against him
      by Wundt. Why are we materialists, pray?—such is the
      burden of Carstanjen’s objections—when we speak of
      “experience”  we do not mean it in the ordinary
      current sense, which leads or might lead to materialism, but in
      the sense that we investigate everything that men
      “predicate”  as experience. Carstanjen and Avenarius
      regard the view that experience is a means of knowledge as
      materialistic (that, perhaps, is the most common opinion, but
      nevertheless, untrue, as we have seen in the case of
      Fichte). Avenarius entrenches himself against the
      “prevailing”  “metaphysics”  which
      persists in regarding the brain as the organ of thought and
      which ignores the theories of introjection and co-ordination. By
      the given or the found (das Vorgefundene), Avenarius
      means the indissoluble connection between the self and
      the environment, which leads to a confused idealist
      interpretation of “experience.”
    

Hence, both the materialist and the idealist, as well as the
      Humean and the Kantian lines in philosophy may unquestionably be
      concealed beneath the word “experience";

    

but neither the
      definition of experience as an object of
investigation,[2]
[2]
Plekhanov perhaps thought that Carstanjen had
      said, “an object of knowledge independent of
      knowledge,”  and not an “object of investigation"?
      This would indeed be materialism. But neither Carstanjen, nor
      anybody else acquainted with empirio-criticism, said or could
      have said, any such thing.
—Lenin


nor its definition as a means
      of knowledge is decisive in this respect. Carstanjen’s
      remarks against Wundt especially have no relation whatever to
      the question of the distinction between empirio-criticism and
      materialism.
    

As a curiosity let us note that on this point Bogdanov and
      Valentinov, in their reply to Plekhanov, revealed no greater
      knowledge of the subject. Bogdanov declared: “It is not
      quite clear”  (Bk. III, p. xi).—"It is the task of
      empirio-criticists to examine this formulation and to accept or
      reject the condition.”  A very convenient position: I,
      forsooth, am not a Machian and am not therefore obliged to find
      out in what sense a certain Avenarius or Carstanjen speaks of
      experience! Bogdanov wants to make use of Machism (and of the
      Machian confusion regarding “experience"), but he does not
      want to be held responsible for it.
    

The “pure”  empirio-criticist Valentinov transcribed
      Plekhanov’s remark and publicly danced the cancan; he
      sneered at Plekhanov for not naming the author and for not
      explaining what the matter was all about
      (op. cit., pp. 108-09). But at the same time
      this empirio-critical philosopher in his answer said not a
      single word on the substance of the matter, although
      acknowledging that he had read Plekhanov’s remark
      “three times or more”  (and had apparently not under
      stood it). Oh, those Machians!

3. Causality And Necessity In Nature

The question of causality is particularly important in
      determining the philosophical line of any new “ism,”
      and we must therefore dwell on it in some detail.
    

Let us begin with an exposition of the materialist theory of
      knowledge on this point. L. Feuerbach’s views are
      expounded with particular clarity in his reply to R. Haym
      already referred to.
    
 

      ‘Nature and human reason,’ says Haym, ‘are for
      him (Feuerbach) completely divorced, and between them a gulf is
      formed which cannot be spanned from one side or the
      other.’ Haym grounds this reproach on § 48 of my
      Essence of Religion where it is said that ‘nature
      may be conceived only through nature itself, that its necessity
      is neither human nor logical, neither metaphysical nor
      mathematical, that nature alone is the being to which it is
      impossible to apply any human measure, although we compare and
      give names to its phenomena, in order to make them
      comprehensible to us, and in general apply human expressions and
      conceptions to them, as for example: order, purpose, law; and
      are obliged to do so because of the character of our
      language.’ What does this mean? Does it mean that there is
      no order in nature, so that, for example, autumn may be
      succeeded by summer, spring by winter, winter by autumn? That
      there is no purpose, so that, for example, there is no
      co-ordination between the lungs and the air, between light and
      the eye, between sound and the ear? That there is no law, so
      that, for example, the earth may move now in an ellipse, now in
      a circle, that it may revolve around the sun now in a year, now
      in a quarter of an hour? What nonsense! What then is meant by
      this passage? Nothing more than to distinguish between that
      which belongs to nature and that which be longs to man; it does
      not assert that there is actually nothing in nature
      corresponding to the words or ideas of order, purpose, law. All
      that it does is to deny the identity between thought and being;
      it denies that they exist in nature exactly as they do in the
      head or mind of man. Order, purpose, law are words used by man
      to translate the acts of nature into his own language
      in order that he may understand them. These words are not devoid
      of meaning or of objective content (nicht sinn-,
      d. h. gegenstandslose Worte); nevertheless, a distinction
      must be made between the original and the translation. Order,
      purpose, law in the human sense express something arbitrary.
    

      “From the contingency of order, purpose and law in nature,
      theism expressly infers their arbitrary origin; it
      infers the existence of a being distinct from nature which
      brings order, purpose, law into a nature that is in itself
      (an sich) chaotic (dissolute) and indifferent
      to all determination.

    

The reason of the theists . . . is reason
      contradictory to nature, reason absolutely devoid of
      understanding of the essence of nature. The reason of the
      theists splits nature into two beings—one material, and
      the other formal or spiritual”  (Werke,
      VII. Band, 1903, S. 518-20).
    

Thus Feuerbach recognises objective law in nature and objective
      causality, which are reflected only with approximate fidelity by
      human ideas of order, law and so forth. With Feuerbach the
      recognition of objective law in nature is inseparably connected
      with the recognition of the objective reality of the external
      world, of objects, bodies, things, reflected by our
      mind. Feuerbach’s views are consistently
      materialistic. All other views, or rather, any other
      philosophical line on the question of causality, the denial of
      objective law, causality and necessity in nature, are justly
      regarded by Feuerbach as belonging to the fideist trend. For it
      is, indeed, clear that the subjectivist line on the question of
      causality, the deduction of the order and necessity of nature
      not from the external objective world, but from consciousness,
      reason, logic, and so forth, not only cuts human reason off from
      nature, not only opposes the former to the latter, but makes
      nature a part of reason, instead of regarding reason as
      a part of nature. The subjectivist line on the ques-tion of
      causality is philosophical idealism (varieties of which are the
      theories of causality of Hume and Kant), i.e..,
      fideism, more or less weakened and diluted. The recognition of
      objective law in nature and the recognition that this law is
      reflected with approximate fidelity in the mind of man is
      materialism.
    

As regards Engels, he had, if I am not mistaken, no occasion to
      contrast his materialist view with other trends on the
      particular question of causality. He had no need to do so, since
      he had definitely dissociated himself from all the agnostics on
      the more fundamental question of the objective reality of the
      external world in general. But to anyone who has read his
      philosophical works at all attentively it must be clear that
      Engels does not admit even the shadow of a doubt as to the
      existence of objective law, causality and necessity in
      nature. We shall confine ourselves to a few examples. In the
      first section of Anti-Dühring   Engels says:
      “In order to understand these details [of the general
      picture

    

of the world phenomena], we must detach them from their
      natural (natürlich) or historical connection and
      examine each one separately, its nature, special causes,
      effects, etc.”  (pp. 5-6). That this natural connection,
      the connection between natural phenomena, exists objectively, is
      obvious. Engels particularly emphasises the dialectical view of
      cause and effect: “And we find, in like manner, that cause
      and effect are conceptions which only hold good in their
      application to individual cases, but as soon as we consider the
      individual cases in their general connection with the universe
      as a whole, they run into each other, and they become confounded
      when we contemplate that universal action and reaction in which
      causes and effects are eternally changing places, so that what
      is effect here and now will be cause there and then, and
      vice versa”  (p. 8). Hence, the human conception
      of cause and effect always somewhat simplifies the objective
      connection of the phenomena of nature, reflecting it only
      approximately, artificially isolating one or another aspect of a
      single world process. If we find that the laws of thought
      correspond with the laws of nature, says Engels, this becomes
      quite conceivable when we take into account that reason and
      consciousness are “products of the human brain and that
      man himself is a product of nature.”  Of course,
      “the products of the human brain, being in the last
      analysis also products of nature, do not contradict the rest of
      nature’s interconnections (Naturzusammenhang) but
      are in correspondence with them”
(p. 22).[5]  There is
      no doubt that there exists a natural, objective interconnection
      between the phenomena of the world. Engels constantly speaks of
      the “laws of nature,”  of the “necessities of
      nature”  (Naturnotwendigkeiten), without
      considering it necessary to explain the generally known
      propositions of materialism.
    

In Ludwig Feuerbach also we read that “the
      general laws of motion—both of the external world and of
      human thought—[are] two sets of laws which are identical
      in substance but differ in their expression in so far as the
      human mind can apply them consciously, while in nature and also
      up to now for the most part in human history, these laws assert
      themselves unconsciously in the form of external necessity in
      the midst of an endless series of seeming accidents”
      (p. 38). And Engels reproaches the old natural philosophy for
      having

    

replaced “the real but as yet unknown
      interconnections”  (of the phenomena of nature) by
      “ideal and imaginary ones”
(p. 42).[6]
      Engels’ recognition of objective law, causality and
      necessity in nature is absolutely clear, as is his emphasis on
      the relative character of our, i.e., man’s
      approximate reflections of this law in various concepts.
    

Passing to Joseph Dietzgen, we must first note one of the
      innumerable distortions committed by our Machians. One of the
      authors of the Studies “in”  the
      Philosophy of Marxism, Mr. Helfond, tells us: “The
      basic points of Dietzgen’s world outlook may be summarised
      in the following propositions: . . . (9) The causal dependence
      which we ascribe to things is in reality not contained in the
      things themselves”  (p. 248). This is sheer
      nonsense. Mr. Helfond, whose own views represent a
      veritable hash of materialism and agnosticism, has
      outrageously falsified J. Dietzgen. Of course, we can find
      plenty of confusion, inexactnesses and errors in Dietzgen, such
      as gladden the hearts of the Machians and oblige materialists to
      regard Dietzgen as a philosopher who is not entirely
      consistent. But to attribute to the materialist J. Dietzgen a
      direct denial of the materialist view of causality—only a
      Helfond, only the Russian Machians are capable of that.
    

      “Objective scientific knowledge,”  says Dietzgen in
      his The Nature of the Workings of the Human Mind
      (German ed. 1903), “seeks for causes not by faith or
      speculation, but by experience and induction, not a
      priori, but a posteriori. Natural science looks
      for causes not outside or back of phenomena, but within or by
      means of them”  (pp. 94-95). “Causes are the
      products of the faculty of thought. They are, however, not its
      pure products, but are produced by it in conjunction with sense
      material. This sense material gives the causes thus derived
      their objective existence. Just as we demand that a truth should
      be the truth of an objective phenomenon, so we demand that a
      cause should be real, that it should be the cause of some
      objective effect”  (pp. 98-99). “The cause of the
      thing is its connection”  (p. 100).
    

It is clear from this that Mr. Helfond has made a statement
      which is directly contrary to fact. The world outlook
      of materialism expounded by J. Dietzgen recognises that
      “the causal dependence”  is contained
      “in the things themselves.”

    

It was necessary for
      the Machian hash that Mr. Helfond should confuse the materialist
      line with the idealist line on the question of causality.
    

Let us now proceed to the latter line.
    

A clear statement of the starting point of Avenarius’
      philosophy on this question is to be found in his first work,
      Philosophie als Denken der Welt gemäss dem Prinzip des
      kleinsten Kraftmasses. In § 81 we read: “Just as
      we do not experience (erfahren) force as causing
      motion, so we do not experience the necessity for any
      motion. . . . All we experience (erfahren) is that the
      one follows the other.”  This is the Humean standpoint in
      its purest form: sensation, experience tell us nothing of any
      necessity. A philosopher who asserts (on the principle of
      “the economy of thought") that only sensation exists could
      not have come to any other conclusion. “Since the idea of
      causality,”  we read further, “demands
      force and necessity or constraint as integral parts of the
      effect, so it falls together with the latter”  (§
      82). “Necessity therefore expresses a particular degree of
      probability with which the effect is, or may be, expected”
      (§ 83, thesis).
    

This is outspoken subjectivism on the question of causality. And
      if one is at all consistent one cannot come to any other
      conclusion unless one recognises objective reality as the source
      of our sensations.
    

Let us turn to Mach. In a special chapter, “Causality and
      Explanation”  (Wärmelehre,  2. Auflage, 1900,
      S. 432-39), we read: “The Humean criticism (of the
      conception of causality) nevertheless retains its
      validity.”  Kant and Hume (Mach does not trouble to deal
      with other philosophers) solve the problem of causality
      differently. “We prefer”  Hume’s
      solution. “Apart from logical necessity
      [Mach’s italics] no other necessity, for instance physical
      necessity, exists.”  This is exactly the view which was so
      vigorously combated by Feuerbach. It never even occurs to Mach
      to deny his kinship with Hume. Only the Russian Machians could
      go so far as to assert that Hume’s agnosticism could be
      “combined”  with Marx’s and Engels’
      materialism. In Mach’s Mechanik, we read:
      “In nature there is neither cause nor effect”
      (S. 474, 3. Auflage, 1897). “I have repeatedly
      demonstrated that all forms of the law of causality spring from
      subjective

    

motives (Trieben) and that there is no
      necessity for nature to correspond with them”  (p. 495).
    

We must here note that our Russian Machians with amazing
      naïveté replace the question of the materialist or
      idealist trend of all arguments on the law of causality by the
      question of one or another formulation of this law. They
      believed the German empirio-critical professors that merely to
      say “functional correlation”  was to make a
      discovery in “recent positivism”  and to release one
      from the “fetishism”  of expressions like
      “necessity,”  “law,”  and so forth. This
      of course is utterly absurd, and Wundt was fully justified in
      ridiculing such a change of words (in the article,
      quoted above, in Philosophische Studien, S. 383, 388),
      which in fact changes nothing. Mach himself speaks of “all
      forms”  of the law of causality and in his Knowledge
      and Error (2. Auflage, S. 278) makes the self-evident
      reservation that the concept function can express the
      “dependence of elements”  more precisely only when
      the possibility is achieved of expressing the results of
      investigation in measurable quantities, which even in
      sciences like chemistry has only partly been
      achieved. Apparently, in the opinion of our Machians, who are so
      credulous as to professorial discoveries, Feuerbach (not to
      mention Engels) did not know that the concepts order, law, and
      so forth, can under certain conditions be expressed as a
      mathematically defined functional relation!
    

The really important epistemological question that divides the
      philosophical trends is not the degree of precision attained by
      our descriptions of causal connections, or whether these
      descriptions can be expressed in exact mathematical formulas,
      but whether the source of our knowledge of these connections is
      objective natural law or properties of our mind, its innate
      faculty of apprehending certain a priori truths, and so
      forth. This is what so irrevocably divides the materialists
      Feuerbach, Marx and Engels from the agnostics (Humeans)
      Avenarius and Mach.
    

In certain parts of his works, Mach, whom it would be a sin to
      accuse of consistency, frequently “forgets”  his
      agreement with Hume and his own subjectivist theory of causality
      and argues “simply”  as a natural scientist,
      i.e.., from the instinctive materialist standpoint. For
      instance,

    

in his


Mechanik, we read of “the
      uniformity which nature teaches us to find in its
      phenomena”  (French ed., p. 182). But if we do
      find uniformity in the phenomena of nature, does this mean
      that uniformity exists objectively outside our mind? No. On the
      question of the uniformity of nature Mach also delivers himself
      thus: “The power that prompts us to complete in thought
      facts only partially observed is the power of association. It is
      greatly strengthened by repetition. It then appears to us to be
      a power which is independent of our will and of individual
      facts, a power which directs thoughts and [Mach’s
      italics] facts, which keeps both in mutual correspondence as a
      law governing both. That we consider ourselves capable of making
      predictions with the help of such a law only [!] proves that
      there is sufficient uniformity in our environment, but it does
      not prove the necessity of the success of our predictions”
      (Wärmelehre, S. 383).
    

It follows that we may and ought to look for a necessity
      apart from the uniformity of our environment,
      i.e.., of nature! Where to look for it is the secret of
      idealist philosophy which is afraid to recognise man’s
      perceptive faculty as a simple reflection of nature. In his last
      work, Knowledge and Error Mach even defines a law of
      nature as a “limitation of expectation”
      (2. Auflage, S. 450 ff.)! Solipsism claims its own.
    

Let us examine the position of other writers of the same
      philosophical trend. The Englishman, Karl Pearson, expresses
      himself with characteristic precision (The Grammar of
      Science, 2nd ed.): “The laws of science are products
      of the human mind rather than factors of the external
      world”  (p. 36). “Those, whether poets or
      materialists, who do homage to nature, as the sovereign of man,
      too often forget that the order and complexity they admire are
      at least as much a product of man’s perceptive and
      reasoning faculties as are their own memories and
      thoughts”  (p. 185). “The comprehensive character of
      natural law is due to the ingenuity of the human mind”
      (ibid.). “Man is the maker of natural
      law,”  it is stated in Chapter III, §
      4. “There is more meaning in the statement that man gives
      laws to nature than in its converse that nature gives laws to
      man,”  although the worthy professor is regretfully
      obliged to admit, the latter (materialist)

    

view is
      “unfortunately far too common today”  (p. 87). In
      the fourth chapter, which is devoted to the question of
      causality, Pearson formulates the following thesis
      (§ 11): “The necessity lies in the world of
      conceptions and not in the world of perceptions.”  It
      should be noted that for Pearson perceptions or
      sense-impressions are the reality existing outside us. “In
      the uniformity with which sequences of perception are repeated
      (the routine of perceptions) there is also no inherent
      necessity, but it is a necessary condition for the existence of
      thinking beings that there should be a routine in the
      perceptions. The necessity thus lies in the nature of the
      thinking being and not in the perceptions themselves; thus it is
      conceivably a product of the perceptive faculty (p. 139)
    

Our Machian, with whom Mach himself frequently expresses
      complete solidarity, thus arrives safely and soundly at pure
      Kantian idealism: it is man who dictates laws to nature and not
      nature that dictates laws to man! The important thing is not the
      repetition of Kant’s doctrine of apriorism—which
      does not define the idealist line in philosophy as such, but
      only a particular formulation of this line—but the fact
      that reason, mind, consciousness are here primary, and nature
      secondary. It is not reason that is a part of nature, one of its
      highest products, the reflection of its processes, but nature
      that is a part of reason, which thereby is stretched from the
      ordinary, simple human reason known to us all to a
      “stupendous,”  as Dietzgen puts it, mysterious,
      divine reason. The Kantian-Machian formula, that “man
      gives laws to nature,”  is a fideist formula. If our
      Machians stare wide-eyed on reading Engels’ statement that
      the fundamental characteristic of materialism is the acceptance
      of nature and not spirit as primary, it only shows how incapable
      they are of distinguishing the really important philosophical
      trends from the mock erudition and sage jargon of the
      professors.
    

J. Petzoldt, who in his two-volume work analysed and developed
      Avenarius, may serve as an excellent example of reactionary
      Machian scholasticism. “Even to this day,”  says he,
      “one hundred and fifty years after Hume, substantiality
      and causality paralyse the daring of the thinker”
      (Introduction to the Philosophy of Pure Experience,
      Bd. I, S. 31). It goes without saying that those who are most



      “daring”  are the solipsists

    

who discovered
      sensation without organic matter, thought without brain, nature
      without objective law! “And the last formulation of
      causality, which we have not yet mentioned, necessity, or
      necessity in nature, contains something vague and
      mystical"—(the idea of “fetishism,”
      “anthropomorphism,”  etc.) (pp. 32, 34). Oh, the
      poor mystics, Feuerbach, Marx and Engels! They have been talking
      all the time of necessity in nature, and have even been calling
      those who hold the Humean position theoretical reactionaries!
      Petzoldt rises above all “anthropomorphism.”  He has
      discovered the great “law of unique
      determination,”  which eliminates every obscurity,
      every trace of “fetishism,”  etc., etc., etc. For
      example, the parallelogram of forces (p. 35). This cannot be
      “proven"; it must be accepted as a “fact of
      experience.”  It cannot be conceded that a body under like
      impulses will move in different ways. “We cannot concede
      nature such indefiniteness and arbitrariness; we must demand
      from it definiteness and law”  (p. 35). Well, well! We
      demand of nature obedience to law. The bourgeoisie demands
      reaction of its professors. “Our thought demands
      definiteness from nature, and nature always conforms to this
      demand; we shall even see that in a certain sense it is
      compelled to conform to it”  (p. 36). Why, having received
      an impulse in the direction of the line AB, does a body move
      towards C and not towards D or F, etc.?
    




      “Why does nature not choose any of the countless other
      directions?”  (p. 37). Because that would be
      “multiple determination,”  and the great
      empirio-critical discovery of Joseph Petzoldt demands unique
      determination.
    

The “empirio-criticists”  fill scores of pages with
      such unutterable trash!
    

      “. . . We have remarked more than once that our thesis
      does not derive its force from a sum of separate experiences,
      but

    

that, on the contrary, we demand that nature should
      recognise its validity (seine Geltung). Indeed, even
      before it becomes a law it has already become for us a principle
      with which we approach reality, a postulate. It is valid, so to
      speak, a priori, independently of all separate
      experiences. It would, indeed, be unbefitting for a philosophy
      of pure experience to preach a priori truths and thus
      relapse into the most sterile metaphysics. Its apriorism can
      only be a logical one, never a psychological, or metaphysical
      one”  (p. 40). Of course, if we call apriorism logical,
      then the reactionary nature of the idea disappears and it
      becomes elevated to the level of “recent positivism"!
    

There can be no unique determination of psychical phenomena,
      Petzoldt further teaches us; the role of imagination, the
      significance of great inventions, etc., here create exceptions,
      while the law of nature, or the law of spirit, tolerates
      “no exceptions”  (p. 65). We have before us a pure
      metaphysician, who has not the slightest inkling of the
      relativity of the difference between the contingent and the
      necessary.
    

I may, perhaps, be reminded—continues Petzoldt—of
      the motivation of historical events or of the development of
      character in poetry. “If we examine the matter carefully
      we shall find that there is no such unique determination. There
      is not a single historical event or a single drama in which we
      could not imagine the participants acting differently under
      similar psychical conditions. . .”  (p. 73). “Unique
      determination is not only absent in the realm of the psychical,
      but we are also entitled to demand its absence from
      reality [Petzoldt’s italics]. Our doctrine is thus
      elevated to the rank of a postulate, i.e.., to
      the rank of a fact, which we regard as a necessary condition of
      a much earlier experience, as its logical a
      priori”  (Petzoldt’s italics, p. 76).
    

And Petzoldt continues to operate with this “logical a
      priori”  in both volumes of his
      Introduction, and in the booklet issued in 1906,
      The World Problem from the Positivist
Standpoint.[1]

Here
      is a second instance of a noted empirio-criticist

    

who has
      imperceptibly slipped into Kantianism and who serves up the most
      reactionary doctrines with a somewhat different sauce. And this
      is not fortuitous, for at the very foundations of Mach’s
      and Avenarius’ teachings on causality there lies an
      idealist falsehood, which no highflown talk of
      “positivism”  can cover up. The distinction between
      the Humean and the Kantian theories of causality is only a
      secondary difference of opinion between agnostics who are
      basically at one, viz., in their denial of objective
      law in nature, and who thus inevitably condemn themselves to
      idealist conclusions of one kind or another. A rather more
      “scrupulous”  empirio-criticist than J. Petzoldt,
      Rudolf Willy, who is ashamed of his kinship with the
      immanentists, rejects, for example, Petzoldt’s whole
      theory of “unique determination”  as leading to
      nothing but “logical formalism.”  But does Willy
      improve his position by disavowing Petzoldt? Not in the least,
      for he disavows Kantian agnosticism solely for the sake of
      Humean agnosticism. “We have known from the time of
      Hume,”  he writes, “that ‘necessity’ is
      a purely logical (not a ‘transcendental’)
      characteristic (Merkmal), or, as I would rather say and
      have already said, a purely verbal (sprachlich)
      characteristic”  (R. Willy, Gegen die
      Schulweisheit, München, 1905, S. 91; cf. S. 173,
      175).
    

The agnostic calls our materialist view of necessity
      “transcendental,”  for from the standpoint of
      Kantian and Humean “school wisdom,”  which Willy
      does not reject but only furbishes up, any recognition of
      objective reality given us in experience is an illicit
      “transcendence.”
    

Among the French writers of the philosophical trend we are
      analysing, we find Henri Poincaré constantly straying into
      this same path of agnosticism. Henri Poincaré is an
      eminent physicist but a poor philosopher, whose errors
      Yushkevich, of course, declared to be the last word of recent
      positivism, so “recent,”  indeed, that it even
      required a new “ism,”  viz.,
      empirio-symbolism. For Poincaré (with whose views as a
      whole we shall deal in the chapter on the new physics), the laws
      of nature are symbols, conventions, which man creates for the
      sake of “convenience.”  “The only
      true objective reality is the internal harmony of the
      world.”  By “objective,”  Poincaré means
      that which is generally

    



regarded as

valid, that which is
      accepted by the majority of men, or by
all[2]

;

that is to
      say, in a purely subjectivist manner he destroys objective
      truth, as do all the Machians. And as regards
      “harmony,”  he categorically declares in answer to
      the question whether it exists outside of
      us—"undoubtedly, no.”  It is perfectly obvious
      that the new terms do not in the least change the ancient
      philosophical position of agnosticism, for the essence of
      Poincaré’s “original”  theory amounts to
      a denial (although he is far from consistent) of objective
      reality and of objective law in nature. It is, therefore,
      perfectly natural that in contradistinction to the Russian
      Machians, who accept new formulations of old errors as the
      latest discoveries, the German Kantians greeted such views as a
      conversion to their own views, i.e.., to agnosticism,
      on a fundamental question of philosophy. “The French
      mathematician Henri Poincaré,”  we read in the work
      of the Kantian, Philipp Frank, “holds the point of view
      that many of the most general laws of theoretical natural
      science (e.g., the law of inertia, the law of
      the conservation of energy, etc.), of which it is so often
      difficult to say whether they are of empirical or of a
      priori origin, are, in fact, neither one nor the other, but
      are purely conventional propositions depending upon human
      discretion. . . .”  “Thus [exults the Kantian] the
      latest Naturphilosophie unexpectedly renews the
      fundamental idea of critical idealism, namely, that experience
      merely fills in a framework which man brings with him from
      nature. . . ."[3]


We quote this example in order to give the reader a clear idea
      of the degree of naïveté of our Yushkeviches, who take
      a “theory of symbolism”  for something genuinely
      new, whereas philosophers in the least versed in their
      subject say plainly and explicitly: he has become converted to
      the standpoint of critical idealism! For the essence of this
      point of view does not necessarily lie in the repetition of
      Kant’s formulations, but in the recognition of the
      fundamental idea common to both Hume and Kant,
      viz., the denial of objective law in nature and the
      deduction of particular

    

“conditions of experience,”
      particular principles, postulates and propositions from the
      subject, from human consciousness, and not from
      nature. Engels was right when he said that it is not important
      to which of the numerous schools of materialism or idealism a
      particular philosopher belongs, but rather whether he takes
      nature, the external world, matter in motion, or spirit, reason,
      consciousness, etc., as primary.
    

Another characterisation of Machism on this question, in
      contrast to the other philosophical lines, is given by the
      expert Kantian, E. Lucka. On the question of causality
      “Mach entirely agrees with
Hume."[4]

      “P. Volkmann derives the necessity of thought from the
      necessity of the processes of nature—a standpoint that, in
      contradistinction to Mach and in agreement with Kant, recognises
      the fact of necessity; but contrary to Kant, it seeks the source
      of necessity not in thought, but in the processes of
      nature”  (p. 424).
    

Volkmann is a physicist who writes fairly extensively on
      epistemological questions, and who tends, as do the vast
      majority of scientists, to materialism, albeit an inconsistent,
      timid, and incoherent materialism. The recognition of necessity
      in nature and the derivation from it of necessity in thought is
      materialism. The derivation of necessity, causality, law, etc.,
      from thought is idealism. The only inaccuracy in the passage
      quoted is that a total denial of all necessity is attributed to
      Mach. We have already seen that this is not true either of Mach
      or of the empirio-critical trend generally, which, having
      definitely departed from materialism, is inevitably sliding into
      idealism.
    

It remains for us to say a few words about the Russian Machians
      in particular. They would like to be Marxists; they have all
      “read”  Engels’ decisive demarcation of
      materialism from the Humean trend; they could not have failed to
      learn both from Mach himself and from everybody in the least
      acquainted with his philosophy that Mach and Avenarius follow
      the line of Hume. Yet they are all careful not to say a
      single word about Humism and materialism on the question

    

of
      causality! Their confusion is utter. Let us give a few
      examples. Mr. P. Yushkevich preaches the “new”
      empirio-symbolism. The “sensations of blue, hard,
      etc.—these supposed data of pure experience”  and
      “the creations supposedly of pure reason, such as a
      chimera or a chess game"—all these are
      “empirio-symbols”  (Studies,
      etc., p. 179). “Knowledge is empirio-symbolic,
      and as it develops leads to empirio-symbols of a greatet degree
      of symbolisation. . . . The so-called laws of nature . . . are
      these empirio-symbols. . .”  (ibid.). “The
      so-called true reality, being in itself,  is that infinite [a
      terribly learned fellow, this Mr. Yushkevich!]  ultimate system
      of symbols to which all our knowledge is striving”
      (p. 188). “The stream of experience . . . which lies at
      the foundation of our knowledge is . . . irrational
      . . . illogical”  (pp. 187, 194). Energy “is just as
      little a thing, a substance, as time, space, mass and the other
      fundamental concepts of science: energy is a constancy, an
      empirio-symbol, like other empirio-symbols that for a time
      satisfy the fundamental human need of introducing reason, Logos,
      into the irrational stream of experience”  (p. 209).
    

Clad like a harlequin in a garish motley of shreds of the
      “latest”  terminology, there stands before us a
      subjective idealist, for whom the external world, nature and its
      laws are all symbols of our knowledge. The stream of experience
      is devoid of reason, order and law: our knowledge brings reason
      into it. The celestial bodies are symbols of human knowledge,
      and so is the earth. If science teaches us that the earth
      existed long before it was possible for man and organic matter
      to have appeared, we, you see, have changed all that! The order
      of the motion of the planets is brought about by us, it
      is a product of our knowledge. And sensing that human reason is
      being inflated by such a philosophy into the author and founder
      of nature, Mr. Yushkevich puts alongside of reason the word
      Logos, that is, reason in the abstract, not reason, but
      Reason, not a function of the human brain, but something
      existing prior to any brain, something divine. The last word of
      “recent positivism”  is that old formula of fideism
      which Feuerbach had already exposed.
    
 

Let us take A. Bogdanov. In 1899, when he was still a
      semi-materialist and had only just begun to go astray under the
      influence of a very great chemist and very muddled philosopher,
      Wilhelm Ostwald, he wrote: “The general causal connection
      of phenomena is the last and best child of human knowledge; it
      is the universal law, the highest of those laws which, to
      express it in the words of a philosopher, human reason dictates
      to nature”  (Fundamental Elements, etc.,
      p. 41).
    

Allah alone knows from what source Bogdanov took this
      reference. But the fact is that “the words of a
      philosopher”  trustingly repeated by the
      “Marxist"—are the words of Kant. An unpleasant
      event! And all the more unpleasant in that it cannot even be
      explained by the “mere”  influence of Ostwald.
    

In 1904, having already managed to discard both
      natural-historical materialism and Ostwald, Bogdanov wrote:
      “. . . Modern positivism regards the law of causality only
      as a means of cognitively connecting phenomena into a continuous
      series, only as a form of co-ordinating experience”
      (From the Psychology of Society, p. 207). Bogdanov
      either did not know, or would not admit, that this modern
      positivism is agnosticism and that it denies the objective
      necessity of nature, which existed prior to, and outside of,
      “knowledge”  and man. He accepted on faith what the
      German professors called “modern positivism.”
      Finally, in 1905, having passed through all the previous stages
      and the stage of empirio-criticism, and being already in the
      stage of “empirio-monism,”  Bogdanov wrote:
      “Laws do not belong to the sphere of experience . . . they
      are not given in it, but are created by thought as a means of
      organising experience, of harmoniously co-ordinating it into a
      symmetrical whole”  (Empirio-Monism, I,
      p. 40). “Laws are abstractions of knowledge; and physical
      laws possess physical properties just as little as psychological
      laws possess psychical properties”  (ibid.).
    

And so, the law that winter succeeds autumn and the spring
      winter is not given us in experience but is created by thought
      as a means of organising, harmonising, co-ordinating. . . what
      with what, Comrade Bogdanov?
    
 

      “Empirio-monism is possible only because knowledge
      actively harmonises experience, eliminating its infinite
      contradictions, creating for it universal organising forms,
      replacing the primeval chaotic world of elements by a
      derivative, ordered world of relations”  (p. 57). That is
      not true. The idea that knowledge can “create”
      universal forms, replace the primeval chaos by order, etc., is
      the idea of idealist philosophy. The world is matter moving in
      conformity to law, and our knowledge, being the highest product
      of nature, is in a position only to reflect this
      conformity to law.
    

In brief, our Machians, blindly believing the
      “recent”  reactionary professors, repeat the
      mistakes of Kantian and Humean agnosticism on the question of
      causality and fail to notice either that these doctrines are in
      absolute contradiction to Marxism, i.e.., materialism,
      or that they themselves are rolling down an inclined plane
      towards idealism.

V. I.  

      Lenin
MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Three: The Theory of Knowledge of Dialectical Materialism and of Empirio-Criticism. III )
4. The “Principle Of Economy Of

 Thought”  And The Problem Of The

 “Unity Of The World”


      “The principle of ‘the least expenditure of
      energy,’ which Mach, Avenarius and many others made the
      basis of the theory of knowledge, is . . . unquestionably a
      ‘Marxist’ tendency in epistemology.”
    

So Bazarov asserts in the Studies, etc., page
      69.
    

There is “economy”  in Marx; there is
      “economy”  in Mach. But is it indeed
      “unquestionable”  that there is even a shadow of
      resemblance between the two?
    

Avenarius’ work, Philosophie als Denken der Welt
      gemäss dem Prinzip des Kleinsten Kraftmasses (1876), as
      we have seen, applies this “principle”  in such a
      way that in the name of “economy of thought”
      sensation alone is declared to exist. Both causality and
      “substance”  (a word which the professorial
      gentlemen, “for the sake of importance,”  prefer to
      the clearer and more exact word: matter) are declared
      “eliminated”  on the same plea of economy. Thus we
      get sensation without matter and thought without brain. This
      utter nonsense is an attempt to smuggle in subjective
      idealism under a new guise. That such precisely is
      the character of this basic work on the celebrated
      “economy of thought”  is, as

    

we have seen,
      generally acknowledged in philosophical
      literature. That our Machians did not notice the subjective
      idealism under the “new”  flag is a fact belonging
      to the realm of curiosities.
    

In the Analysis of Sensations (Russ. trans., p. 49),
      Mach refers incidentally to his work of 1872 on this
      question. And this work, as we have seen, propounds the
      standpoint of pure subjectivism and reduces the world to
      sensations. Thus, both the fundamental works which introduce
      this famous “principle”  into philosophy expound
      idealism! What is the reason for this? The reason is that if the
      principle of economy of thought is really made “the
      basis of the theory of knowledge,”  it can lead to
      nothing but subjective idealism. That it is more
      “economical”  to “think”  that only I
      and my sensations exist is unquestionable, provided we want to
      introduce such an absurd conception into epistemology.
    

Is it “more economical”  to “think”  of
      the atom as indivisible, or as composed of positive and negative
      electrons? Is it “more economical”  to think of the
      Russian bourgeois revolution as being conducted by the liberals
      or as being conducted against the liberals? One has only to put
      the question in order to see the absurdity, the subjectivism of
      applying the category of “the economy of thought”
      here. Human thought is “economical”  only
      when it correctly reflects objective truth, and the
      criterion of this correctness is practice, experiment and
      industry. Only by denying objective reality, that is, by denying
      the foundations of Marxism, can one seriously speak of
      economy of thought in the theory of knowledge.
    

If we turn to Mach’s later works, we shall find in them an
      interpretation of the celebrated principle which
      frequently amounts to its complete denial. For instance, in the
      Wärmelehre Mach returns to his favourite idea of
      “the economical nature”  of science (2nd German ed.,
      p. 366). But there he adds that we engage in an activity not for
      the sake of the activity (p. 366; repeated on p. 391):
      “the purpose of scientific activity is to present the
      fullest . . . most tranquil . . . picture possible of the
      world”  (p. 366). If this is the case, the
      “principle of economy”  is banished not only from
      the basis of epistemology, but virtually from epistemology

    

generally. When one says that the purpose of science is to
      present a the picture of the world (tranquillity is entirely
      beside the point here), one is repeating the materialist point
      of view. When one says this, one is admitting the objective
      reality of the world in relation to our knowledge, of the model
      in relation to the picture. To talk of economy of
      thought in such a connection is merely to use a clumsy
      and ridiculously pretentious word in place of the word
      “correctness.”  Mach is muddled here, as usua], and
      the Machians behold the muddle and worship it!
    

In Knowledge and Error, in the chapter entitled
      “Illustrations of Methods of Investigation,”  we
      read the following:
    

      “The ‘complete and simplest description’
      (Kirchhoff, 1874), the ‘economical presentation of the
      factual’ (Mach, 1872), the ‘concordance of thinking
      and being and the mutual concordance of the processes of
      thought’ (Grassmann, 1844)—all these, with slight
      variations, express one and the same thought.”
    

Is this not a model of confusion? “Economy of
      thought,”  from which Mach in 1872 inferred that
      sensations alone exist (a point of view which he
      himself subsequently was obliged to acknowledge an idealist
      one), is declared to be equivalent to the purely
      materialist dictum of the mathematician Grassmann regarding the
      necessity of co-ordinating thinking and being,
      equivalent to the simplest description (of an
      objective reality, the existence of which it never
      occurred to Kirchhoff to doubtl).
    

Such an application of the principle of “economy
      of thought”  is but an example of Mach’s curious
      philosophical waverings. And if such curiosities and lapses are
      eliminated, the idealist character of “the principle of
      the economy of thought”  becomes unquestionable. For
      example, the Kantian Hönigswald, controverting the
      philosophy of Mach, greets his “principle of
      economy”  as an approach to the “Kantian
      circle of ideas”  (Dr. Richard Hönigswald, Zur
      Kritik der Machschen Philosophie [A Critique of
      Mach’s Philosophy], Berlin, 1903, S. 27). And, in
      truth, if we do not recognise the objective reality given us in
      our sensations, whence are we to derive the “principle of
      economy”  if not from the subject? Sensations, of
      course, do not contain any “economy.”  Hence,
      thought gives us something which is not contained in sensations!
      Hence, the

    

“principle of economy”  is not taken from
      experience (i.e.., sensations), but precedes all
      experience and, like a Kantian category, constitutes a logical
      condition of experience. Hönigswald quotes the following
      passage from the Analysis of Sensations: “We can
      from our bodily and spiritual stability infer the stability, the
      uniqueness of determination and the uniformity of the processes
      of nature”  (Russ. trans., p. 281). And, indeed, the
      subjective-idealist character of such propositions and the
      kinship of Mach to Petzoldt, who has gone to the length of
      apriorism, are beyond all shadow of doubt.
    

In connection with “the principle of the economy of
      thought,”  the idealist Wundt very aptly characterised
      Mach as “Kant turned inside out”  (Systematische
      Philosophie, Leipzig, 1907, S. 128). Kant has a
      priori and experience, Mach has experience and a
      priori, for Mach’s principle of the econ omy of
      thought is essentially apriorism (p. 130). The con nection
      (Verknüpfung) is either in things, as an
      “objective law of nature [and this Mach emphatically
      rejects], or else it is a subjective principle of
      description”  (p. 130). The principle of economy with Mach
      is subjective and kommt wie aus der Pistole
      geschossen—appears nobody knows whence—as a
      teleological principle which may have a diversity of meanings
      (p. 131). As you see, experts in philosophical terminology are
      not as naïve as our Machians, who are blindly prepared to
      believe that a “new”  term can eliminate the
      contrast between subjectivism and objectivism, between idealism
      and materialism.
    

Finally, let us turn to the English philosopher James Ward, who
      without circumlocution calls himself a spiritualist monist. He
      does not controvert Mach, but, as we shall see later, utilises
      the entire Machian trend in physics in his fight against
      materialism. And he definitely declares that with Mach
      “the criterion of simplicity . . . is in the main
      subjective, not objective”  (Naturalism and
      Agnosticism, Vol. I, 3rd ed., p. 82).
    

That the principle of the economy of thought as the basis of
      epistemology pleased the German Kantians and English
      spiritualists will not seem strange after all that has been said
      above. That people who are desirous of being Marxists should
      link the political economy of the materialist Marx

    

with the
      epistemological economy of Mach is simply ludicrous.
    

It would be appropriate here to say a few words about “the
      unity of the world.”  On this question Mr. P. Yushkevich
      strikingly exemplifies—for the thousandth time
      perhaps—the abysmal confusion created by our
      Machians. Engels, in his Anti-Dühring, replies to
      Dühring, who had deduced the unity of the world from the
      unity of thought, as follows: “The real unity of the world
      consists in its materiality, and this is proved not by a few
      juggling phrases, but by a long and protracted development of
      philosophy and natural science”
(p. 31).[1]
      Mr. Yushkevich cites this passage and retorts: “First of
      all it is not clear what is meant here by the assertion that
      ‘the unity of the world consists in its
      materiality’”  (op. cit., p. 52).
    

Charming, is it not? This individual undertakes publicly to
      prate about the philosophy of Marxism, and then declares that
      the most elementary propositions of materialism are “not
      clear”  to him! Engels showed, using Dühring as an
      example, that any philosophy that claims to be consistent can
      deduce the unity of the world either from thought—in which
      case it is helpless against spiritualism and fideism
      (Anti-Dühring, p. 30), and its arguments
      inevitably become mere phrase-juggling—or from the
      objective reality which exists outside us, which in the theory
      of knowledge has long gone under the name of matter, and which
      is studied by natural science. It is useless to speak seriously
      to an individual to whom such a thing is “not
      clear,”  for he says it is “not clear” in
      order fraudulently to evade giving a genuine answer to
      Engels’ clear materialist proposition. And, doing so, he
      talks pure Dühringian nonsense about “the cardinal
      postulate of the fundamental homogeneity and connection of
      being”  (Yushkevich, op. cit., p. 51),
      about postulates being “propositions”  of which
      “it would not be exact to say that they have been deduced
      from expericnce, since scientific experience is possible only
      because they are made the basis of investigation”
      (ibid.). This is nothing but twaddle, for if this
      individual had the slightest respect for the printed word he
      would detect the idealist character in general, and the
      Kantian character in particular of the idea that there
      can be postulates which are not taken from experience

    

and
      without which experience is impossible. A jumble of words culled
      from diverse books and coupled with the obvious errors of the
      materialist Dietzgen—such is the “philosophy”
      of Mr. Yushkevich and his like.
    

Let us rather examine the argument for the unity of the world
      expounded by a serious empirio-criticist, Joseph
      Petzoldt. Section 29, Vol. II, of his Introduction is
      termed: “The Tendency to a Uniform (einheitlich)
      Conception of the Realm of Knowledge; the Postulate of the
      Unique Determination of All That Happens.”  And here are a
      few samples of his line of reasoning: “. . . Only in
      unity can one find that natural end beyond which no
      thought can go and in which, consequently, thought, if it takes
      into consideration all the facts of the given sphere, can reach
      quiescence”  (p. 79). “. . . It is beyond doubt that
      nature does not always respond to the demand for unity,
      but it is equally beyond doubt that in many cases it already
      satisfies the demand for quiescence and it must be
      held, in accordance with all our previous investigations, that
      nature in all probability will satisfy this demand in the future
      in all cases. Hence, it would be more correct to describe the
      actual soul behaviour as a striving for states of stability
      rather than as a striving for unity. . . . The principle of the
      states of stability goes farther and
      deeper. . . . Haeckel’s proposal to put the kingdom of the
      protista alongside the plant and animal kingdom is an untenable
      solution for it creates two new difficulties in place of the
      former one difficulty: while formerly the boundary between the
      plants and animals was doubtful, now it becomes impossible to
      demarcate the protista from both plants and
      animals. . . . Obviously, such a state is not final
      (endgültig). Such ambiguity of concepts
      must in one way or another be eliminated, if only, should there
      be no other means, by an agreement between the specialists, or
      by a majority vote”  (pp. 80-81).
    

Enough, I think? It is evident that the ernpirio-criticist
      Petzoldt is not one whit better than Dühring. But
      we must be fair even to an adversary; Petzoldt at least has
      sufficient scientific integrity to reject materialism as a
      philosophical trend unflinchingly and decisively in all
      his works. At least, he does not humiliate himself to the extent
      of posing as a materialist and declaring that the most
      elementary distinction between the fundamental philosophical
      trends is “not clear.”

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Three: The Theory of Knowledge of Dialectical Materialism and of Empirio-Criticism. III )
5. Space And Time

Recognising the existence of objective reality, i.e..,
      matter in motion, independently of our mind, materialism must
      also inevitably recognise the objective reality of time and
      space, in contrast above all to Kantianism, which in this
      question sides with idealism and regards time and space not as
      objective realities but as forms of human understanding. The
      basic difference between the two fundamental philosophical lines
      on this question is also quite clearly recognised by writers of
      the most diverse trends who are in any way consistent
      thinkers. Let us begin with the materialists.
    

      “Space and time,”  says Feuerbach, “are not
      mere forms of phenomena but essential conditions
      (Wesensbedingungen) . . . of being”  (Werke,
      II, S. 332). Regarding the sensible world we know through
      sensations as objective reality, Feuerbach naturally also
      rejects the phenomenalist (as Mach would call his own
      conception) or the agnostic (as Engels calls it) conception of
      space and time. Just as things or bodies are not mere phenomena,
      not complexes of sensations, but objective realities acting on
      our senses, so space and time are not mere forms of phenomena,
      but objectively real forms of being. There is nothing in the
      world but matter in motion, and matter in motion cannot move
      otherwise than in space and time. Human conceptions of space and
      time are relative, but these relative conceptions go to compound
      absolute truth. These relative conceptions, in their
      development, move towards absolute truth and approach nearer and
      nearer to it. The mutability of human conceptions of space and
      time no more refutes the objective reality of space and time
      than the mutability of scientific knowledge of the structure and
      forms of matter in motion refutes the objective reality of the
      external world.
    

Engels, exposing the inconsistent and muddled materialist
      Dühring, catches him on the very point where he speaks of
      the change in the idea of time (a question beyond
      controversy for contemporary philosophers of any importance even
      of the most diverse philosophical trends) but
      evades a direct answer to the question: are space and
      time real or ideal, and are our relative conceptions of space
      and time approximations to objectively real forms of
      being, or are they only products

    

of the developing, organising,
      harmonising, etc., human mind? This and this alone is the basic
      epistemological problem on which the truly fundamental
      philosophical trends are divided. Engels, in
      Anti-Dühring, says: “We are here not in the
      least concerned with what ideas change in Herr
      Dühring’s head. The subject at issue is not the
      idea of time, but real time, which Herr
      Dühring cannot rid him self of so cheaply [i.e..,
      by the use of such phrases as the mutability of our
      conceptions]”  (Anti-Dühring, 5th Germ. ed.,
      S. 41).[5]


This would seem so clear that even the Yushkeviches should be
      able to grasp the essence of the matter! Engels sets up against
      Dühring the proposition of the reality,
      i.e.., objective reality, of time which is generally
      accepted by and obvious to every materialist, and says that
      one cannot escape a direct affirmation or denial of
      this proposition merely by talking of the change in the
      ideas of time and space. The point is not that Engels
      denies the necessity and scientific value of investigations into
      the change and development of our ideas of time and space, but
      that we should give a consistent answer to the epistemological
      question, viz., the question of the source and
      significance of human knowledge in general. Any moderately
      intelligent philosophical idealist—and Engels when he
      speaks of idealists has in mind the great consistent idealists
      of classical philosophy—will readily admit the development
      of our ideas of time and space; he would not cease to be an
      idealist for thinking, for example, that our developing ideas of
      time and space are approaching towards the absolute idea of time
      and space, and so forth. It is impossible to hold consistently
      to a standpoint in philosophy which is inimical to all forms of
      fideism and idealism if we do not definitely and resolutely
      recognise that our developing notions of time and space
      reflect an objectively real time and space; that here,
      too, as in general, they are approaching objective truth.
    

      “The basic forms of all being,”  Engels admonishes
      Dühring, “are space and time, and existence out of
      time is just as gross an absurdity as existence out of
      space”  (op. cit.).
    

Why was it necessary for Engels, in the first half of the
      quotation, to repeat Feuerbach almost literally and, in the
      second, to recall the struggle which Feuerbach fought

    

so
      successfully against the gross absurdities of theism? Because
      Dühring, as one sees from this same chapter of
      Engels’, could not get the ends of his philosophy to meet
      without resorting now to the “final cause”  of the
      world, now to the “initial impulse”  (which is
      another expression for the concept “God,”  Engels
      says). Dühring no doubt wanted to be a materialist and
      atheist no less sincerely than our Machians want to be Marxists,
      but he was unable consistently to develop the
      philosophical point of view that would really cut the ground
      from under the idealist and theist absurdity. Since he did not
      recognise, or, at least, did not recognise clearly and
      distinctly (for he wavered and was muddled on this question),
      the objective reality of time and space, it was not accidental
      but inevitable that Dühring should slide down an inclined
      plane to “final causes”  and “initial
      impulses"; for he had deprived himself of the objective
      criterion which prevents one going beyond the bounds of time and
      space. If time and space are only concepts, man, who
      created them is justified in going beyond their bounds,
      and bourgeois professors are justified in receiving salaries
      from reactionary governments for defending the right to go
      beyond these bounds, for directly or indirectly defending
      medieal “absurdity.”
    

Engels pointed out to Dühring that denial of the objective
      reality of time-and space is theoretically philosophical
      confusion, while practically it is capitulation to, or impotence
      in face of, fideism.
    

Behold now the “teachings”  of “recent
      positivism”  on this subject. We read in Mach:
      “Space and time are well ordered (wohlgeordnete)
      systems of series of sensations”  (Mechanik,
      3. Auflage, S. 498). This is palpable idealist nonsense, such as
      inevitably follows from the doctrine that bodies are complexes
      of sensations. According to Mach, it is not man with his
      sensations that exists in space and time, but space and time
      that exist in man, that depend upon man and are generated by
      man. He feels that he is falling into idealism, and
      “resists”  by making a host of reservations and,
      like Dühring, burying the question under lengthy
      disquisitions (see especially Knowledge and Error) on
      the mutability of our conceptions of space and time, their
      relativity, and so forth. But this does not save

    

him, and cannot
      save him, for one can really overcome the idealist position on
      this question only by recognising the objective reality of space
      and time. And this Mach will not do at any price. He constructs
      his epistemological theory of time and space on the principle of
      relativism, and that is all. In the very nature of things such a
      construction can lead to nothing but subjective idealism, as we
      have already made clear when speaking of absolute and relative
      truth.
    

Resisting the idealist conclusions which inevitably follow from
      his premises, Mach argues against Kant and insists that our
      notion of space is derived from experience (Knowledge
      and Error, 2nd Germ. ed., pp. 350, 385). But if
      objective reality is not given us in experience (as
      Mach teaches), such an objection to Kant does not in the least
      destroy the general position of agnosticism in the case
      either of Kant or of Mach. If our notion of
      space is taken from experience without being a
      reflection of objective reality outside us, Mach’s theory
      remains idealistic. The existence of nature in time,
      measured in millions of years, prior to the appearance
      of man and human experience, shows how absurd this idealist
      theory is.
    

      “In the physiological respect,”  writes Mach,
      “time and space are systems of sensations of orientation
      which together with sense-perceptions determine the discharge
      (Auslösung) of biologically purposive reactions of
      adaptation. In the physical respect, time and space are
      interdependencies of physical elements”  (ibid.,
      p. 434).
    

The relativist Mach confines himself to an examination of the
      concept of time in its various aspects! And like
      Dühring he gets nowhere. If “elements”  are
      sensations, then the dependence of physical elements upon each
      other cannot exist outside of man, and could not have existed
      prior to man and prior to organic matter. If the sensations of
      time and space can give man a biologically purposive
      orientation, this can only be so on the condition that these
      sensations reflect an objective reality outside man:
      man could never have adapted himself biologically to the
      environment if his sensations had not given him an
      objectively correct presentation of that
      environment. The theory of space and time is inseparably
      connected with the answer to the fundamental question of
      epistemology: are our sensations images of bodies and things,
      or are bodies

    

complexes of our sensations? Mach merely blunders
      about beiween t’ne two answers.
    

In modern physics, he says, Newton’s idea of absolute time
      and space prevails (pp. 442-44), of time and space as such. This
      idea seems “to us”  senseless, Mach
      continues—apparently not suspecting the existence of
      materialists and of a materialist theory of knowledge. But
      in practice, he claims, this view was harmless
      (unschädlich, p. 442) and therefore for a long time
      escaped criticism.
    

This naïve remark regarding the harmlessness of the
      materialist view betrays Mach completely. Firstly, it is not
      true that for a “long time”  the idealists did not
      criticise this view. Mach simply ignores the struggle between
      the idealist and materialist theories of knowledge on this
      question; he evades giving a plain and direct statement of these
      two views. Secondly, by recognising “the
      harmlessness”  of the materialist views he contests, Mach
      thereby in fact admits their correctness. For if they were
      incorrect, how could they have remained harmless throughout the
      course of centuries? What has become of the criterion of
      practice with which Mach attempted to flirt? The materialist
      view of the objective reality of time and space can be
      “harmless”  only because natural science does
      not transcend the bounds of time and space, the bounds of
      the material world, leaving this occupation to the professors of
      reactionary philosophy. Such “harmlessness”  is
      equivalent to correctness.
    

It is Mach’s idealist view of space and time that is
      “harmful,”  for, in the first place, it opens the
      door wide for fideism and, in the second place, seduces
      Mach himself into drawing reactionary conclusions. For instance,
      in 1872 Mach wrote that “one does not have to conceive of
      the chemical elements in a space of three dimensions”
      (Erhaltung der Arbeit, S. 29, repeated on S. 55). To do
      so would be “to impose an unnecessary restriction upon
      ourselves. There is no more necessity to think of what is mere
      thought (das bloss Gedachte) spatially, that is to say,
      in relation to the visible and tangible, than there is to think
      of it in a definite pitch”  (p. 27). “The reason why
      a satisfactory theory of electricity has not yet been
      established is perhaps because we have insisted on explaining
      electrical phenomena in terms of molecular processes in a
      three-dimensional space”  (p. 30).
    
 

From the standpoint of the straightforward and unmuddled Machism
      which Mach openly advocated in 1872, it is indisputable that if
      molecules, atoms, in a word, chemical elements, cannot be
      perceived, they are “mere thought”  (das bloss
      Gedachte). If so, and if space and time have no objective
      reality, it is obvious that it is not essential to think of
      atoms spatially! Let physics and chemistry
      “restrict themselves”  to a three-dimensional space
      in which matter moves; for the explanation of electricity,
      however, we may seck its elements in a space which is
      not three-dimensional!
    

That our Machians should circumspectly avoid all reference to
      this absurdity of Mach’s, although he repeats it in 1906
      (Knowledge and Error, 2. Auflage, S. 418), is
      understandable, for otherwise they would have to raise the
      question of the idealist and materialist views of space
      point-blank, without evasions and without attempting to
      “reconcile”  these antagonistic positions. It is
      likewise understandable that in the ‘seventies, when Mach
      was still entirely unknown and when “orthodox
      physicists”  even refused to publish his articles, one of
      the chiefs of the immanentist school, Anton von Leclair, should
      eagerly have seized upon precisely this
      argument of Mach’s as a noteworthy renunciation of
      materialism and recognition of idealism! For at that time
      Leclair had not yet invented, or had not yet borrowed from
      Schuppe and Schubert-Soldern, or J. Rehmke, the
      “new”  sobriquet, “immanentist school,”
      but plainly called himself a critical
      idealist.[1]

      This unequivocal advocate of fideism, who openly preached it in
      his philosophical works, immediately proclaimed Mach a great
      philosopher because of these statements, a “revolutionary
      in the best sense of the word”  (p. 252); and he was
      absolutely right. Mach’s argument amounts to deserting
      science for fideism. Science was seeking, both in 1872 and in
      1906, is now seeking, and is discovering—at least it
      is groping its way towards—the atom of electricity,
      the electron, in three-dimensional space. Science does not doubt
      that the substance

    

it is investigating exists in
      three-dimensional space and, hence, that the particles of that
      substance, although they be so small that we cannot see them,
      must also “necessarily”  exist in this
      three-dimensional space. Since 1872, during the course of three
      decades of stupendous and dazzling scientific successes in the
      problem of the structure of matter, the materialist view of
      space and time has remained “harmless,”
      i.e.., compatible, as heretofore, with science, while
      the contrary view of Mach and Co. was a “harmful”
      capitulation to the position of fideism.
    

In his Mechanik, Mach defends the mathematicians who
      are investigating the problem of conceivable spaces with
      n dimensions; he defends them against the charge of
      drawing “preposterous”  conclusions from their
      investigations. The defence is absolutely and undoubtedly just,
      but see the epistemological position Mach takes up in
      this defence. Recent mathematics, Mach says, has raised the very
      important and useful question of a space of n
      dimensions as a conceivable space; nevertheless,
      three-dimensional space remains the only “real case”
      (ein wirklicher Fall) (3rd German ed., pp. 483-85). In
      vain, therefore, “have many theologians, who experience
      difficulty in deciding where to place hell,”  as well as
      the spiritualists, sought to derive advantage from the fourth
      dimension (ibid.).
    

Very good! Mach refuses to join company with the theologians and
      the spiritualists. But how does he dissociate himself from them
      in his theory of knowledge? By stating that
      three-dimensional space alone is real! But what sort of defence
      is it against the theologians and their like when you deny
      objective reality to space and time? Why, it comes to this, that
      when you have to dissociate yourself from the spiritualists you
      resort to tacit borrowings from the materialists. For the
      materialists, by recognising the real world, the matter we
      perceive, as an objective reality, have the right to
      conclude therefrom that no human concept, whatever its
      purpose, is valid if it goes beyond the bounds of time and
      space. But you Machian gentlemen deny the objective validity of
      “reality”  when you combat materialism, yet secretly
      introduce it again when you have to combat an idealism that is
      consistent, fearless and frank throughout! If in the
      relative conception of time and space there is

    

nothing
      but relativity, if there is no objective reality
      (i.e.., reality independent of man and mankind)
      reflected by these relative concepts, why should mankind, why
      should the majority of mankind, not be entitled to conceive of
      beings outside time and space? If Mach is entitled to seek atoms
      of electricity, or atoms in general, outside
      three-dimensional space, why should the majority of mankind not
      be entitled to seek the atoms, or the foundations of morals,
      outside three-dimensional space?
    

      “There has never been an accoucheur who has helped a
      delivery by means of the fourth dimension,”  Mach goes on
      to say.
    

An excellent argument—but only for those who regard the
      criterion of practice as a confirmation of the
      objective truth and objective reality of our
      perceptual world. If our sensations give us an objectively true
      image of the external world, existing independently of us, the
      argument based on the accoucheur, on human practice generally,
      is valid. But if so, Machism as a philosophical trend is not
      valid.
    

      “I hope, however,”  Mach continues, referring to his
      work of 1872, “that nobody will defend ghost-stories
      (die Kosten einer Spukgeschichte bestreiten) with the
      help of what I have said and written on this subject.”
      One cannot hope that Napoleon did not die on May 5, 1821.
    

One cannot hope that Machism will not be used in the service of
      “ghost-stories”  when it has already served and
      continues to serve the immanentists!
    

And not only the immanentists, as we shall see
      later. Philosophical idealism is nothing but a disguised and
      embellished ghost-story. Look at the French and English
      representatives of empirio-criticism, who are less flowery than
      the German representatives of this philosophical
      trend. Poincaré says that the concepts space and time are
      relative and that it follows (for non-materialists “it
      follows”  indeed) that “nature does not impose them
      upon us, but we impose them upon nature, for we find them
      convenient”  (op. cit., p. 6). Does this
      not justify the exultation of the German Kantians? Does this not
      confirm Engels’ statement that consistent philosophical
      doctrines must take either nature or human thought as primary?
    
 

The views of the English Machist Karl Pearson are quite
      definite. He says: “Of time as of space we cannot assert a
      real existence: it is not in things but in our mode of
      perceiving them”  (op. cit.,
      p. 184). This is idealism, pure and simple. “Like space,
      it [time] appears to us as one of the plans on which that great
      sorting-machine, the human perceptive faculty, arranges its
      material”  (ibid.). Pearson’s final
      conclusion, expounded as usual in clear and precise theses, is
      as follows: “Space and time are not realities of the
      phenomenal world, but the modes under which we perceive things
      apart. They are not infinitely large nor infinitely divisible,
      but are essentially limited by the contents of our
      perception”  (p. 191, summary of Chapter V on Space and
      Time).
    

This conscientious and scrupulous foe of materialism, with whom,
      we repeat, Mach frequently expresses his complete agreement and
      who in his turn explicitly expresses his agreement with Mach,
      invents no special signboard for his philosophy, and without the
      least ambiguity names Hume and Kant as the classics from whom he
      derives his philosophical trend! (p. 192).
    

And while in Russia there are naïve people who believe that
      Machism has provided a “new”  solution of the
      problem of space and time, in English writings we find that
      scientists, on the one hand, and idealist philosophers, on the
      other, at once took up a definite position in regard to Karl
      Pearson the Machian. Here, for example, is the opinion of Lloyd
      Morgan, the biologist: “Physics as such accepts the
      phenomenal world as external to, and for its purposes
      independent of, the mind of the investigator. . . . He
      [Professor Pearson] is forced to a position which is largely
      idealistic. . . ."[2]

      “Physics, as a science, is wise, I take it, in dealing
      with space and time in frankly objective terms, and I think the
      biologist may still discuss the distribution of organisms in
      space and the geologist their distribution in time, without
      pausing to remind their readers that after all they are only
      dealing with sense-impressions and stored sense-impressions and
      certain forms of perception. . . . All this may be true enough,
      but it is out of place either in physics

    

or biology”
      (p. 304). Lloyd Morgan is a representative of the kind of
      agnosticism that Engels calls “shamefaced
      materialism,”  and however “conciliatory”  the
      tendencies of such a philosophy are, nevertheless it proved
      impossible to reconcile Pearson’s views with science. With
      Pearson “the mind is first in space, and then space in
      it,”  says another
critic.[3]

 “There can be no doubt,”  remarked a
      defender of Pearson, R. J. Ryle, “that the doctrine as to
      the nature of space and time which is associated with the name
      of Kant is the most important positive addition which has been
      made to the idealistic theory of human knowledge since the days
      of Bishop Berkeley; and it is one of the noteworthy features of
      the Grammar of Science that here, perhaps for the first
      time in the writings of English men of science, we find at once
      a full recognition of the general truth of Kant’s
      doctrine, a short but clear exposition of
it...."[4]


Thus we find that in England the Machians themselves, their
      adversaries among the scientists, and their adherents
among the professional philsophers have not even a shadow of doubt
as to the idealistic character of Mach’s doctrine of time and space. Only
some Russian writers, would-be Marxists, "failed to notice" it.
    

      “Many of Engels’ particular views,”
      V. Bazarov, for instance, writes, in the Studies
      (p. 67), “as for example, his conception of
      ‘pure’ time and space, are now obsolete.”
    

Indeed! The views of the materialist Engels are now obsolete,
      but the views of the idealist Pearson and the muddled idealist
      Mach are very modern! The most curious thing of all is that
      Bazarov does not even doubt that the views of space and time,
      viz., the recognition or denial of their objective
      reality, can be classed among “particular
      views,”  in contradistinction to the
      “starting point of the world outlook”
      spoken of by this author in his next sentence. Here you have a
      glaring example of that “eclectic pauper’s
      broth”  of which Engels was wont to speak in reference to
      German philosophy of the ‘eighties. For to contrast the
      “starting point”  of Marx’s and Engels’
      materialist world outlook

    

with their “particular
      view”  of the objective reality of time and space is as
      utterly nonsensical as though you were to contrast the
      “starting point”  of Marx’s economic theory
      with his “particular view”  of surplus value. To
      sever Engels’ doctrine of the objective reality of time
      and space from his doctrine of the transformation of
      “things-in-themselves”  into
      “things-for-us,”  from his recognition of objective
      and absolute truth, viz., the objective reality given
      us in our sensations, and from his recognition of objective law,
      causality and necessity in nature—is to reduce an integral
      philosophy to an utter jumble. Like all the Machians, Bazarov
      erred in confounding the mutability of human conceptions of time
      and space, their exclusively relative character, with the
      immutabil-ity of the fact that man and nature exist only in time
      and space, and that beings outside time and space, as invented
      by the priests and maintained by the imagination of the ignorant
      and downtrodden mass of humanity, are disordered fantasies, the
      artifices of philosophical idealism—rotten products of a
      rotten social system. The teachings of science on the structure
      of matter, on the chemical composition of food, on the atom and
      the electron, may and constantly do become obsolete, but the
      truth that man is unable to subsist on ideas and to beget
      children by platonic love alone never becomes obsolete. And a
      philosophy that denies the objective reality of time and space
      is as absurd, as intrinsically rotten and false as is the denial
      of these latter truths. The artifices of the idealists and the
      agnostics are on the whole as hypocritical as the sermons on
      platonic love of the pharisees!
    

In order to illustrate this distinction between the relativity
      of our concepts of time and space and the absolute
      opposition, within the bounds of epistemology, between the
      materialist and idealist lines on this question, I shall further
      quote a characteristic passage from a very old and very pure
      “empirio-criticist,”  namely, the Humean
      Schulze-Aenesidemus who wrote in 1792:
    

      “If we infer ‘things outside us’ from ideas
      and thoughts within us, [then] space and time are something real
      and actually existing outside us, for the existence of bodies
      can be conceived only in an existing (vorhandenen)
      space, and the existence of changes only in an existing
      time”  (op. cit., p. 100).
    
 

Exactly! While firmly rejecting materialism, and even the
      slightest concession to materialism, Schulze, the follower of
      Hume, described in 1792 the relation between the question of
      space and time and the question of an objective reality out-side
      us just as the materialist Engels described it in 1894 (the last
      preface to Anti-Dühring is dated May
      23,1894). This does not mean that during these hundred years our
      ideas of time and space have undergone no change, or that a vast
      amount of new material has not been gathered on the
      development of these ideas (material to which both
      Voroshilov-Chernov and Voroshilov-Valentinov refer as supposedly
      refuting Engels). This does mean that the relation
      between materialism and agnosticism, as the fundamental
      lines in philosophy, could not have changed, in spite of all the
      “new”  names paraded by our Machians.
    

And Bogdanov too contributes absolutely nothing but
      “new”  names to the old philosophy of idealism and
      agnosticism. When he repeats the arguments of Hering and Mach on
      the difference between physiological and geometrical space, or
      between perceptual and abstract space (Empirio-Monism,
      Bk. I, p. 26), he is fully repeating the mistake of
      Dühring. It is one thing, how, with the help of various
      sensc organs, man perceives space, and how, in the course of a
      long historical development, abstract ideas of space are derived
      from these perceptions; it is an entirely different thing
      whether there is an objective reality independent of mankind
      which corresponds to these perceptions and conceptions of
      mankind. This latter question, although it is the only
      philosophical question, Bogdanov “did not notice”
      beneath the mass of detailed investigations on the former
      question, and he was therefore unable clearly to distinguish
      between Engels’ materialism and Mach’s confusion.
    

Time, like space, is “a form of social co-ordination of
      the experiences of different people,”  their
      “objectivity”  lies in their “general
      significance”  (ibid., p. 34).
    

This is absolutely false. Religion also has general significance
      as expressing the social co-ordination of the experience of the
      larger section of humanity. But there is no objective reality
      that corresponds

    

to the teachings of religion, for example, on
      the past of the earth and the creation of the world. There
      is an objective reality that corresponds to
      the teaching of science (although it is as relative at every
      stage in the development of science as every stage in the
      development of religion is relative) that the earth existed
      prior to any society, prior to man, prior
      to organic matter, and that it bas existed for a
      definite time and in a definite space in
      relation to the other planets. According to Bogdanov, various
      forms of space and time adapt themselves to man’s
      experience and his perceptive faculty. As a matter of fact, just
      the reverse is true: our “experience”  and our
      perception adapt themselves more and more to objective
      space and time, and reflect them ever more correctly
      and profoundly.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Three: The Theory of Knowledge of Dialectical Materialism and of Empirio-Criticism. III )
6. Freedom and Necessity

On pages 140–41 of the Studies, A. Lunacharsky quotes
      the argument given by Engels in Anti-Dühring on
      this question and fully endorses the “remarkably precise
      and apt”  statement of the problem made by Engels in that
      “wonderful
page”[1]
[1]
Lunacharsky says: “. . . a wonderful page
      of religious economics. I say this at the risk of provoking a
      smile from the irreligious reader.”  However good your
      intentions may be, Comrade Lunacharsky, it is not a smile, but
      disgust your flirtation with religion
provokes.[10]
—Lenin


of the work mentioned.
    

There is, indeed, much that is wonderful here. And even more
      “wonderful”  is the fact that neither Lunacharsky,
      nor the whole crowd of other Machian would-be Marxists,
      “noticed”  the epistemological significance of
      Engels’ discussion of freedom and necessity. They read it
      and they copied it, but they did not make head or tail of it.
    

Engels says: “Hegel was the first to state correctly the
      relation between freedom and necessity. To him, freedom is the
      appreciation of necessity. ‘Necessity is blind
      only in so far as it is not understood.’ Freedom
      does not consist in the dream of independence from natural laws,
      but in the knowledge of these laws, and in the possibility this
      gives of systematically making them work towards definite
      ends. This holds good in relation both to the laws of external
      nature and to those which govern the bodily and mental existence
      of men themselves—two classes of laws which we can
      separate from each other at most only in thought but

    

not in
      reality. Freedom of the will therefore means nothing but the
      capacity to make decisions with knowledge of the
      subject. Therefore the freer a man’s judgment is
      in relation to a definite question, the greater is the
      necessity with which the content of this judgment will
      be determined. . . . Freedom therefore consists in the control
      over ourselves and over external nature, a control founded on
      knowledge of natural necessity
      (Naturnotwendigkeiten).”  (5th Germ. ed.,
      pp. 112–13.)[8]


Let us examine the epistemological premises upon which this
      argument is based.
    

Firstly, Engels at the very outset of his argument recognises
      laws of nature, laws of external nature, the necessity of
      nature—i.e.., all that Mach, Avenarius, Petzoldt
      and Co. characterise as “metaphysics.”  If
      Lunacharsky had really wanted to reflect on Engels’
      “wonderful”  argument he could not have helped
      noticing the fundamental difference between the materialist
      theory of knowledge and agnosticism and idealism, which deny law
      in nature or declare it to be only “logical,”  etc.,
      etc.
    

Secondly, Engels does not attempt to contrive
      “definitions”  of freedom and necessity, the kind of
      scholastic definition with which the reactionary professors
      (like Avenarius) and their disciples (like Bogdanov) are most
      concerned. Engels takes the knowledge and will of man, on the
      one hand, and the necessity of nature, on the other, and instead
      of giving definitions, simply says that the necessity of nature
      is primary, and human will and mind secondary. The latter must
      necessarily and inevitably adapt themselves to the
      former. Engels regards this as so obvious that he does not waste
      words explaining his view. It needs the Russian Machians to
      complain of Engels’ general definition
      of materialism (that nature is primary and mind secondary;
      remember Bogdanov’s “perplexity”  on this
      point!), and at the same time to regard one of the
      particular applications by Engels of this general and
      fundamental definition as “wonderful”  and
      “remarkably apt"!
    

Thirdly, Engels does not doubt the existence of “blind
      necessity.”  He admits the existence of a necessity
      unknown to man. This is quite obvious from the passage
      just quoted. But how, from the standpoint of the Machians, can
      man know
    

of the existence of what he does not
      know? Is it not “mysticism,”
      “metaphysics,”  the admission of
      “fetishes”  and “idols,”  is it not the
      “Kantian unknowable thing-in-itself”  to say that we
      know of the existence of an unknown necessity? Had the Machians
      given the matter any thought they could not have failed to
      observe the complete identity between Engels’
      argument on the knowability of the objective nature of things
      and on the transformation of “things-in-themselves”
      into “things-for-us,”  on the one hand, and his
      argument on a blind, unknown necessity, on the other. The
      development of con-sciousness in each human individual and the
      development of the collective knowledge of humanity at large
      presents us at every step with examples of the transformation of
      the unknown “thing-in-itself”  into the known
      “thing-for-us,”  of the transformation of blind,
      unknown necessity, “necessity-in-itself,”  into the
      known “necessity-for-us.”  Epistemologically, there
      is no difference whatever between these two transformations, for
      the basic point of view in both cases is the same,
      viz., materialistic, the recognition of the objective
      reality of the external world and of the laws of external
      nature, and of the fact that this world and these laws are fully
      knowable to man but can never be known to him with
      finality. We do not know the necessity of nature in the
      phenomena of the weather, and to that extent we are inevitably
      slaves of the weather. But while we do not know this
      necessity, we do know that it exists. Whence this
      knowledge? From the very source whence comes the knowledge that
      things exist outside our mind and independently of it, namely,
      from the development of our knowledge, which provides millions
      of examples to every individual of knowledge replacing ignorance
      when an object acts upon our sense-organs, and conversely of
      ignorance replacing knowledge when the possibility of such
      action is eliminated.
    

Fourthly, in the above-mentioned argument Engels plainly employs
      the salto vitale method in philosophy, that is to say,
      he makes a leap from theory to practice. Not a single
      one of the learned (and stupid) professors of philosophy, in
      whose footsteps our Machians follow, would permit himself to
      make such a leap, for this would be a disgraceful thing for a
      devotee of “pure science”  to do. For them the

    

theory of knowledge, which demands the cunning concoction of
      “definitions,”  is one thing, while practice is
      another. For Engels all living human practice permeates the
      theory of knowledge itself and provides an objective
      criterion of truth. For until we know a law of nature, it,
      existing and acting independently and outside our mind, makes us
      slaves of “blind necessity.”  But once we come to
      know this law, which acts (as Marx pointed out a thousand times)
      independently of our will and our mind, we become the
      masters of nature. The mastery of nature manifested in human
      practice is a result of an objectively correct reflection within
      the human head of the phenomena and processes of nature, and is
      proof of the fact that this reflection (within the limits of
      what is revealed by practice) is objective, absolute, and
      eternal truth.
    

What is the result? Every step in Engels’ argument,
      literally almost every phrase, every proposition, is constructed
      entirely and exclusively upon the epistemology of dialectical
      materialism, upon premises which stand out in striking contrast
      to the Machian nonsense about bodies being complexes of
      sensations, about “elements,”  “the
      coincidence of sense-perceptions with the reality that exists
      outside us,”  etc., etc., etc. Without being the least
      deterred by this, the Machians abandon materialism and repeat
      (à la Berman) the vulgar banalities about
      dialectics, and at the same time welcome with open arms
      one of the applications of dialectical materialism!
      They have taken their philosophy from an eclectic pauper’s
      broth and are continuing to offer this hotchpotch to the
      reader. They take a bit of agnosticism and a morsel of idealism
      from Mach, add to it slices of dialectical materialism from
      Marx, and call this hash a development of Marxism. They
      imagine that if Mach, Avenarius, Petzoldt, and all the
      authorities of theirs have not the slightest inkling of how
      Hegel and Marx solved the problem (of freedom and necessity),
      this is purely acci-dental: why, it was simply because they
      overlooked a certain page in a certain book, and not because
      these “authorities”  were and are utter ignoramuses
      on the subject of the real progress made by philosophy
      in the nineteenth century and because they were and are
      philosophical obscurantists.
    
 

Here is the argument of one such obscurantist, the philosophy
      professor-in-ordinary at the University of Vienna, Ernst Mach:
    

      “The correctness of the position of determinism or
      indeterminism cannot be demonstrated. Only a perfect science or
      a provedly impossible science could decide this question. It is
      a matter of the presuppositions which we bring (man
      heranbringt) to the consideration of things, depending upon
      whether we ascribe to previous successes or failures of the
      investigation a greater or lesser subjective weight
      (subjektives Gewicht). But during the investigation
      every thinker is of necessity a theoretical determinist”
      (Knowledge and Error, 2nd Germ. ed., pp. 282-83).
    

Is this not obscurantism, when pure theory is carefully
      partitioned off from practice; when determinism is confined to
      the field of “investigation,”  while in the field of
      morality, social activity, and all fields other than
      “investigation”  the question is left to a
      “subjective”  estimate? In my workroom, says the
      learned pedant, I am a determinist; but that the philosopher
      should seek to obtain an integral conception of the world based
      on determinism, embracing both theory and practice—of that
      there is no mention. Mach utters banalities because on the
      theoretical problem of freedom and necessity he is entirely at
      sea.
    

      “. . . Every new discovery discloses the defects of our
      knowledge, reveals a residue of dependencies hitherto
      un-heeded. . .”  (p. 283). Excellent! And is this
      “residue”  the “thing-in-itself,”  which
      our knowledge reflects ever more deeply? Not at all:
      “. . . Thus, he also who in theory defends extreme
      determinism, must nevertheless in practice remain an
      indeterminist. . .”  (p. 283). And so things have been
      amicably
divided[2]

:

theory for the
      professors, practice for the theologians! Or, objectivism
      (i.e.., “shamefaced”  materialism) in
      theory and the “subjective method in
sociology”[9] in
      practice. No wonder the Russian ideologists of philistinism, the
      Narodniks, from Lessevich to Chernov, sympathise with this banal
      philosophy. But it is very sad that would-be Marxists

    

have been
      captivated by such nonsense and are embarrassedly covering up
      the more absurd of Mach’s conclusions.
    

But on the question of the will Mach is not content with
      confusion and half-hearted agnosticism: he goes much
      further. “. . . Our sensation of hunger,”  we read
      in the Mechenik, “is not so essentially different
      from the affinity of sulphuric acid for zinc, and our will is
      not so very different from the pressure of the stone on its
      support. . . . We shall thus find ourselves [that is, if we hold
      such a view] nearer to nature without it being necessary to
      resolve ourselves into an incomprehensible nebula of atoms, or
      to resolve nature into a system of phantoms”  (French
      trans., p. 434). Thus there is no need for materialism (“nebula
      of atoms”  or electrons, i.e.., the recognition
      of the objective reality of the material world), there is no
      need for an idealism which would recognise the world as
      “the otherness”  of spirit; but there is a possible
      idealism which recognises the world as will! We are
      superior not only to materialism, but also to the idealism of a
      Hegel; but we are not averse to coquetting with an idealism like
      Schopenhauer’s! Our Machians, who assume an air of injured
      innocence at every reminder of Mach’s kinship to
      philosophical idealism, preferred to keep silent on this
      delicate question too. Yet it is difficult to find in
      philosophical writings an exposition of Mach’s views which
      does not mention his tendency towards
      Willensmetaphysik, i.e.., voluntaristic
      idealism. This was pointed out by
J. Baumann,[3]

and in replying to him
      the Machian Kleinpeter does not take exception to this point,
      but declares that Mach is, of course, “nearer to Kant and
      Berkeley than to the metaphysical empiricism prevailing in
      science”  (i.e.., instinctive materialism;
      ibid., Bd. 6, S. 87). This is also pointed out by
      E. Becher, who remarks that if Mach in some places advocates
      voluntaristic metaphysics, and in others renounces it, it only
      testifies to the arbitrariness of his terminology; in fact,
      Mach’s kinship to voluntarist metaphysics is beyond
      doubt.[4]

      Even Lucka admits

    

the admixture of this metaphysics
      (i.e.., idealism) to “phenomenalism”
      (i.e..,
agnosticism).[5]

      W. Wundt also points this
out.[6]

 That Mach is a phenomenalist who is “not
      averse to voluntaristic idealism”  is attested also in
      Ueberweg-Heinze’s textbook on the history of modern
      philosophy.[7]


In short, Mach’s eclecticism and his tendency to idealism
      are clear to everyone except perhaps the Russian Machians.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

Chapter Four:

The Philosophical Idealists as Comrades-In-Arms and Successors of
Empirio-Criticism

So far we have examined
empirio-criticism taken by itself. We must now examine it in its
      historical development and in its connection and relation with
      other philosophical trends. First comes the question of the
      relation of Mach and Avenarius to Kant.

1. The Criticism of Kantianism
      from the Left and From the Right

Both Mach and Avenarius began their philosophical careers in
the seventies, when the fashionable cry in German
professorial circles was “Back to Kant” And,
indeed, both founders of empirio-criticism in their
philosophical development started from Kant. “His
[Kant’s] critical idealism,” says Mach,
“was, as I acknowledge with the deepest gratitude, the
starting point of all my critical thought. But I found it
impossible to remain faithful to it. Very soon I began to
return to the views of Berkeley . . . [and then] arrived at
views akin to those of Hume. . . . And even today I cannot
help regarding Berkeley and Hume as far more consistent
thinkers than Kant” (Analysis of Sensations,
p. 292).
      

Thus Mach quite definitely admits that having begun with Kant
he soon followed the line of Berkeley and Hume. Let us turn to
Avenarius.       
 

In his Prolegomena to a “Critique of Pure
Experience” (1876), Avenarius already in the
foreword states that the words Kritik der reinen Erfahrung
(Critique of Pure Experience) are indicative of his
attitude towards Kant’s “Critique of Pure
Reason,” and “of course, of an antagonistic
attitude” towards Kant (1876 ed., p. iv). In what does
Avenarius’ antagonism to Kant consist? In the fact that
Kant, in Avenarius’ opinion, had not sufficiently
“purified experience.” It is with this
“purification of experience” that Avenarius deals
in his Prolegomena (§§ 56, 72 and many
other places). Of what does Avenarius “purify” the
Kantian doctrine of experience? In the first place, of
apriorism. In § 56 he says: “The question as to
whether the superfluous ‘a priori conceptions
of reason’ should and could be eliminated from the
content of experience and thereby pure experience par
excellence established is, as far as I know, raised here,
as such, for the first time.” We have already seen that
Avenarius in this way “purified” Kantianism of the
recognition of necessity and causality.       

Secondly, he purifies Kantianism of the assumption of
substance (§ 95), i.e.,the thing-in-itself,
which, in Avenarius’ opinion “is not given in the
stuff of actual experience but is imported into it by
thought.”       

We shall presently see that Avenarius’ definition of his
philosophical line entirely coincides with that of Mach,
differing only in pompousness of formulation. But we must
first note that Avenarius is telling a plain untruth
when he asserts that it was he who in 1876 for the first
time raised the question of “purifying
experience,” i.e., of purifying the Kantian
doctrine of apriorism and the assumption of the
thing-in-itself. As a matter of fact, the development of
German classical philosophy immediately after Kant gave rise
to a criticism of Kantianism exactly along the very
line followed by Avenarius. This line is represented in
German classical philosophy by Schulze-Aenesidemus, an
adherent of Humean agnosticism, and by J. G. Fichte, an
adherent of Berkeleianism, i.e., of subjective
idealism. In 1792 Schulze-Aenesidemus criticised Kant for
this very recognition of apriorism (op. cit.,
pp. 56,141, etc.) and of the thing-in-itself. We sceptics, or
followers of Hume, says Schulze, reject the thing-in-itself as
being “beyond the bounds of all experience”
(p. 57). We reject objective knowledge (p. 25);

    

we
deny that space and time really exist outside us (p. 100); we
reject the presence in our experience of necessity (p. 112),
causality, force, etc. (p. 113). One cannot attribute to them
any “reality outside our conceptions”
(p. 114). Kant proves apriority “dogmatically,”
saying that since we cannot think otherwise there is therefore
an a priori law of thought. “This
argument,” Schulze replies to Kant, “has long been
utilised in philosophy to prove the objective nature of what
lies outside our ideas” (p. 141), Arguing thus, we may
attribute causality to things in-themselves
(p. 142). “Experience never tells us (wir erfahren
niemals) that the action on us of objective things
produces ideas,” and Kant by no means proved that
“this something (which lies outside our reason) must be
regarded as a thing in-itself, distinct from our sensation
(Gemut). But sensation also may be thought of as the
sole basis of all our knowledge” (p. 265). The
Kantian critique of pure reason “bases its argument on
the proposition that every act of cognition begins with the
action of objective things on our organs of sensation
(Gemüt), but it then disputes the truth and
reality of this proposition” (p. 266). Kant in no way
refuted the idealist Berkeley (pp. 268-72).       

It is evident from this that the Humean Schulze rejects
Kant’s doctrine of the thing-in-itself as an
inconsistent concession to materialism, i.e.,to the
“dogmatic” assertion that in our sensations we are
given objective reality, or, in other words, that our ideas
are caused by the action of objective things (independent of
our mind) on our sense-organs. The agnostic Schulze reproaches
the agnostic Kant on the grounds that the latter’s
assumption of the thing-in-itself contradicts agnosticism and
leads to materialism. In the same way, but even more
vigorously, Kant is criticised by the subjective idealist
Fichte, who maintains that Kant’s assumption of the
thing-in-itself independent of the self is
“realism” (Werke, I, S. 483),
and that Kant makes “no clear” distinction between
“realism” and “idealism.” Fichte sees
a crying inconsistency in the assumption of Kant and the
Kantians that the thing-in-itself is the “basis of
objective reality” (p. 480), for this is in
contradiction to critical idealism. “With you,”
exclaims Fichte, addressing the realist expositors of Kant,
“the earth rests on the

    

great elephant, and the great
elephant rests on the earth. Your thing-in-itself, which is
only thought, acts on the self!” ( p. 483).       

Thus Avenarius was profoundly mistaken in imagining that he
“for the first time” undertook a
“purification of the experience” of Kant from
apriorism and from the thing-in-itself and that he was thereby
giving rise to a “new” trend in philosophy. In
reality he was continuing the old line of Hume and
Berkeley, Schulze-Aenesidemus and J. G. Fichte. Avenarius
imagined that he was “purifying experience” in
general. In reality he was only purifying agnosticism of
Kantianism. He fought not against the agnosticism of Kant
(agnosticism is a denial of objective reality given in
sensation), but for a purer agnosticism, for the
elimination of Kant’s assumption, which is contradictory
to agnosticism, that there is a thing-in itself, albeit
unknowable, noumenal and other-sided, that there is necessity
and causality, albeit a priori, given in our
understanding, and not in objective reality. He fought Kant
not from the Left, as the materialists fought Kant,
but from the Right, as the sceptics and idealists
fought Kant. He imagined that he was advancing, when in
reality he was retreating to the programme of criticising Kant
which Kuno Fischer, speaking of Schulze-Aenesidemus, aptly
characterised in the following words: “The critique of
pure reason with pure reason [i.e., apriorism] left
out is scepticism. The critique of pure reason with the
thing-in-itself left out is Berkeleian idealism”
(History of Modern Philosophy, German ed., 1869,
Vol. V, p. 115).       

This brings us to one of the most curious episodes in our
whole “Machiad,” in the whole campaign of the
Russian Machians against Engels and Marx. The latest discovery
by Bogdanov and Bazarov, Yushkevich and Valentinov, trumpeted
by them in a thousand different keys, is that Plekhanov is
making a “luckless attempt to reconcile Engels with Kant
by the aid of a compromise—a thing-in-itself which is
just a wee bit knowable” (Studies,
etc., p. 67 and many other places). This discovery of
our Machians discloses a veritable bottomless pit of utter
confusion and monstrous misunderstanding both of Kant and of
the whole course of development of German classical
philosophy.       
 

The principal feature of Kant’s philosophy is the
reconciliation of materialism with idealism, a compromise
between the two, the combination within one system of
heterogeneous and contrary philosophical trends. When Kant
assumes that something outside us, a thing-in-itself,
corresponds to our ideas, he is a materialist. When he
declares this thing-in-itself to be unknowable,
transcendental, other-sided, he is an idealist. Recognising
experience, sensations, as the only source of our knowledge,
Kant is directing his philosophy towards sensationalism, and
via sensationalism, under certain conditions, towards
materialism. Recognising the apriority of space, time,
causality, etc., Kant is directing his philosophy towards
idealism. Both consistent materialists and consistent
idealists (as well as the “pure” agnostics, the
Humeans) have mercilessly criticised Kant for this
inconsistency. The materialists blamed Kant for his idealism,
rejected the idealist features of his system, demonstrated the
knowability, the this-sidedness of the thing-in-itself, the
absence of a fundamental difference between the
thing-in-itself and the phenomenon, the need of deducing
causality, etc., not from a priori laws of thought,
but from objective reality. The agnostics and idealists blamed
Kant for his assumption of the thing-in-itself as a concession
to materialism, “realism” or “naïve
realism”. The agnostics, moreover, rejected not only the
thing-in-itself, but apriorism as well; while the idealists
demanded the consistent deduction from pure thought not only
of the a priori forms of perception, but of the world
as a whole (by magnifying human thought to an abstract
Self, or to an “Absolute Idea”, or to a
“Universal Will”  etc., etc.). And here
our Machists, “without noticing” that they have
taken as their teachers people who had criticised Kant from
the standpoint of scepticism and idealsim, began to rend their
cloathes and to cover their heads with ashes at the sight of
monstrous people who criticised Kant from a diametrically
opposite point of view, who rejected the slightest
element of agnosticism (scepticism) and idealism in his
system, who demonstrated that the thing-in-itself is
objectively real, fully knowable and this-sided, that it does
not differ fundamentally from appearance, that it becomes
transformed into appearance at every step in the

    

development
of the individual consciouness of man and the collective
consciousness of mankind. Help!—they cried— this
is an illegitimate mixture of materialism and Kantianism!       

When I read the assurances of our Machists that they criticise
Kant for more consistently and thoroughly than any of the
antiquated materialists, it always seems to me as though
Purishkevich[1]

had joined our company and was
shouting: I criticised the
Constitutional-Democrats[4] far
more consistently and thoroughly than you Marxist gentlemen!
There is no question about it, Mr. Purishkevich, politically
consistent people can and always will criticise the
Constitutional-Democrats from diametrically opposite points of
view, but after all it must not be forgotten that you
criticised the Constitutional-Democrats for being
excessively democratic, while we criticised them for
being insufficiently democratic! The Machians
criticise Kant for being too much of a materialist, while we
criticise him for not being enough of a materialist. The
Machians criticise Kant from the Right, we from the Left.       

The Humean Schulze and the subjective idealist Fichte may be
taken as examples of the former category of critics in the
history of classical German philosophy. As we have already
seen, they try to obliterate the “realistic”
elements of Kantianism. Just as Schulze and Fichte criticised
Kant himself, so the Humean empirio-criticists and the
subjective idealist-immanentists criticised the German
Neo-Kantians of the second half of the nineteenth century. The
line of Hume and Berkeley reappeared in a slightly renovated
verbal garb. Mach and Avenarius reproached Kant not because
his treatment of the thing-in-itself was not sufficiently
realistic, not sufficiently materialistic, but because he
assumed its existence; not because he refused to
deduce causality and necessity in nature from objective
reality, but because he assumed causality and necessity at all
(except perhaps purely “logical” necessity). The
immanentists were at one with the empirio-criticists, also
criticising Kant from the Humean and Berkeleian
standpoint. For instance, Leclair in 1879, in the work in
which he praised Mach as a remarkable philosopher, reproached
Kant for his “inconsistency and connivance at
realism” as expressed in the concept of the
“thing-in-itself”—that

    

“nominal residuum of vulgar realism” (Der
Realismus der modernen Naturwissenschaft, usw.,
S. 9). Leclair calls materialism “vulgar
realism”—in order “to make it stronger.”
“In our opinion,” writes Leclair, “all those
parts of the Kantian theory which gravitate towards
realismus vulgaris should be vanquished and
eliminated as being inconsistencies and bastard
(zwitterhaft) products from the idealist point of
view” (p. 41). “The inconsistencies and
contradictions in the Kantian theory of knowledge [arise from]
the amalgamation (Verquickung) of idealist criticism
with still unvanquished remnants of realistic dogmatism”
(p. 170). By realistic dogmatism Leclair means materialism.       

Another immanentist, Johannes Rehmke, reproached Kant because
he realistically walled himself off from Berkeley
with the thing-in-itself (Johannes Rehmke, Die Welt als
Wahrnehmung und Begriff, Berlin, 1880, S. 9). “The
philosophical activity of Kant bore an essentially polemical
character: with the thing-in-itself he turned against German
rationalism [i.e., the old fideism of the eighteenth
century], and with pure contemplation against English
empiricism” (p. 25). “I would compare the Kantian
thing-in-itself with a movable lid placed over a pit: the
thing looks so innocent and safe; one steps on it and suddenly
falls into . . . the ‘world-in-itself’”
(p. 27). That is why Kant is not liked by the
associates of Mach and Avenarius, the immanentists; they do
not like him because in some respects he approaches the
“pit” of materialism!       

And here are some examples of the criticism of Kant from the
Left. Feuerbach reproaches Kant not for his
“realism,” but for his idealism, and
describes his system as “idealism based on
empiricism” (Werke, II, 296).       

Here is a particularly important remark on Kant by
Feuerbach. “Kant says: If we regard—as we
should—the objects of our perceptions as mere
appearances, we thereby admit that at the bottom of
appearances is a thing-in-itself, although we do not know how
it is actually constructed, but only know its appearance,
i.e.,the manner in which our senses are affected
(affiziert) by this unknown something. Hence, our
reason, by the very fact that it accepts appearances, also
admits the existence of things-in-themselves;

    

and to that
extent we can say that to entertain an idea of such entities
which lie at the bottom of appearances, and consequently are
but thought entities, is not only permissible, but
unavoidable. . . .” Having selected a passage from Kant
where the thing-in-itself is regarded merely as a mental
thing, a thought entity, and not a real thing, Feuerbach
directs his whole criticism against
it. “. . . Therefore,” he says, “the objects
of the senses [the objects of experience] are for the mind
only appearances, and not truth. . . . Yet the thought
entities are not actual objects for the mind! The Kantian
philosophy is a contradiction between subject and object,
between entity and existence, thinking and being. Entity is
left to the mind, existence to the senses. Existence without
entity [i.e., the existence of appearances without
objective reality] is mere appearance—the sensible
things—while entity without existence is mere
thought—the thought entities, the noumena; they are
thought of, but they lack existence—at least for
us—and objectivity; they are the things-in-themselves,
the true things, but they are not real things. . . . But what
a contradiction, to sever truth from reality, reality from
truth!” (Werke, II, S. 302-03). Feuerbach
reproaches Kant not because he assumes things-in-themselves,
but because he does not grant them reality,
i.e.,objective reality, because he regards them as
mere thought, “thought entities,” and not as
“entities possessing existence,”
i.e.,real and actually existing. Feuerbach rebukes
Kant for deviating from materialism.       

“The Kantian philosophy is a contradiction,”
Feuerbach wrote to Bolin on March 26, 1858, “it
inevitably leads either to Fichtean idealism or to
sensationalism.” The former conclusion “belongs to
the past,” the latter “to the present and the
future” (Grün, op. cit., II,
49). We have already seen that Feuerbach advocates objective
sensationalism, i.e.,materialism. The new turn from
Kant to agnosticism and idealism, to Hume and Berkeley, is
undoubtedly reactionary, even from Feuerbach’s
standpoint. And his ardent follower, Albrecht Rau, who
together with the merits of Feuerbach also adopted his faults,
which were eliminated by Marx and Engels, criticised Kant
wholly in the spirit of his teacher: “The Kantian
philosophy is an amphibole [ambiguity]; it is both materialism
and idealism, and the key

    

to its essence lies in its dual
nature. As a materialist or an empiricist, Kant cannot help
conceding things an existence (Wesenheit) outside
us. But as an idealist he could not rid himself of the
prejudice that the soul is an entity totally different from
sensible things. Hence there are real things and a human mind
which apprehends those things. But how can the mind approach
things totally different from itself? The way out adopted by
Kant is as follows: the mind possesses certain a
priori knowledge, in virtue of which things must appear
to it as they do. Hence, the fact that we understand things as
we do is a fact of our creation. For the mind which lives
within us is nothing but the divine mind, and just as God
created the world out of nothing, so the human mind creates
out of things something which they are not in themselves. Thus
Kant guarantees real things their existence as
‘things-in-themselves.’ Kant, however, needed the
soul, because immortality was for him a moral postulate. The
‘thing-in-itself,’ gentle men [says Rau,
addressing the Neo-Kantians in general and the muddleheaded
A. Lange in particular, who falsified the History of
Materialism], is what separates the idealism of Kant from
the idealism of Berkeley; it spans the gap between materialism
and idealism. Such is my criticism of the Kantian philosophy,
and let those who can refute it. . . .” “For the
materialist a distinction between a priori knowledge
and the ‘thing-in-itself’ is absolutely
superfluous, for since he nowhere breaks the continuity of
nature, since he does not regard matter and mind as two
fundamentally different things, but as two aspects of one and
the same thing, he need not resort to artifice in order to
bring the mind and the thing into
conjunction.”[2]


Further, Engels as we have seen, rebuked Kant for being an
agnostic, but not for his deviation from consistent
agnosticism. Lafargue, Engels’ disciple, argued in 1900
against the Kantians (amongst whom at that time was Charles
Rappoport) as follows:       

“. . . At the beginning of the nineteenth century our
bourgeoisie,

    

having completed its task of revolutionary
destruction, began to repudiate its Voltairean and
free-thinking philosophy. Catholicism, which the master
decorator Chateaubriand painted in romantic colours
(peinturlurait), was restored to fashion, and
Sebastian Mercier imported the idealism of Kant in order to
give the coup de grâce to the materialism of the
Encyclopaedists, whose protagonists had been guillotined by
Robespierre.       

“At the end of the nineteenth century, which will go
down in history as the ‘bourgeois century,’ the
intellectuals attempted to crush the materialism of Marx and
Engels beneath the philosophy of Kant. The reactionary
movement started in Germany—without offence to the
socialist integralistes  who would like to ascribe
the honour to their chief, Malon. But Malon himself had been
to the school of Höchberg, Bernstein and the other
disciples of Dühring, who were reforming Marxism in
Zurich. [Lafargue is referring to the ideological movement in
German socialism in the later
seventies.[5]] It is
to be expected that Jaurès, Fournière and our other
intellectuals will also treat us to Kant as soon as they have
mastered his terminology. . . . Rappoport is mistaken when he
assures us that for Marx the ‘ideal and the real are
identical.’ In the first place we never employ such
metaphysical phraseology. An idea is as real as the object of
which it is the reflection in the brain. . . . To provide a
little recreation for the comrades who have to acquaint
themselves with bourgeois philosophy, I shall explain the
substance of this famous problem which has so much exercised
spiritualist minds.       

“The workingman who eats sausage and receives a hundred
sous a day knows very well that he is robbed by the employer
and is nourished by pork meat, that the employer is a robber
and that the sausage is pleasant to the taste and nourishing
to the body. Not at all, say the bourgeois sophists, whether
they are called Pyrrho, Hume or Kant. His opinion is personal,
an entirely subjective opinion; he might with equal reason
maintain that the employer is his benefactor and that the
sausage consists of chopped leather, for he cannot know
things-in-themselves.       

“The question is not properly put, that is the whole
trouble. . . . In order to know an object, man must first
verify

    

whether his senses deceive him or not. . . . The
chemists have gone still further—they have penetrated
into bodies, they have analysed them, decomposed them into
their elements, and then performed the reverse procedure, they
have recomposed them from their elements. And from the moment
that man is able to produce things for his own use from these
elements, he may, as Engels says, assert that he knows the
things-in-themselves. The God of the Christians, if he
existed and if he created the world, could do no
more.”[3]


We have taken the liberty of making this long quotation in
order to show how Lafargue understood Engels and how he
criticised Kant from the Left, not for those aspects of
Kantianism which distinguish it from Humism, but for those
which are common to both Kant and Hume; not for his assumption
of the thing-in-itself, but for his inadequately materialist
view of it.       

And lastly, Karl Kautsky in his Ethics also
criticises Kant from a standpoint diametrically opposed to
that of Hume and Berkeley. “That I see green, red and
white,” he writes, arguing against Kant’s
epistemology, “is grounded in my faculty of sight. But
that green is something different from red testifies to
something that lies outside of me, to real differences between
the things. . . . The relations and differences between the
things themselves revealed to me by the individual space and
time concepts . . . are real relations and differences of the
external world, not conditioned by the nature of my perceptive
faculty. . . . If this were really so [if Kant’s
doctrine of the ideality of time and space were true], we
could know nothing about the world outside us, not even that
it exists.” (Russian Translation, pp. 33-34.)       

Thus the entire school of Feuerbach, Marx and Engels
turned from Kant to the Left, to a complete rejection of all
idealism and of all agnosticism. But our Machians followed the
reactionary trend in philosophy, Mach and Avenarius,
who criticised Kant from the standpoint of Hume and
Berkeley. Of course, it is the sacred right of every citizen,
and particularly of every intellectual, to follow any
ideological

    

reactionary he likes. But when people who have
radically severed relations with the very foundations of
Marxism in philosophy begin to dodge, confuse matters,
hedge and assure us that they “too” are Marxists
in philosophy, that they are “almost” in agreement
with Marx, and have only slightly “supplemented”
him—the spectacle is a far from pleasant one.

Constitutional-Democrats
(Cadets)——members of the
Constitutional—Democratic Party, the leading party of
the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie in Russia. The Cadet Party
was founded in October 1905; it included representatives of
the bourgeoisie, landlord Zemstvo members and bourgeois
intellectuals. Prominent lenders of the Cadets were
P. N. Milyukov, S. A. Muromtsev, V.A. Moklakov, A, I, Shin
garev, P. B. Struve, F. I. Bodichey and others. To deceive the
working people the Cadets falsely entitled themselves the
“party of people’s freedom”, but actually did not
go beyond the demand for a constitutional monarchy. The Cadets
made the struggle against the revolutionary movement their
chief aim and endeavoured to share power with the tsar and
feudal landlords. During the First World War the Cadets
actively supported the annexationist foreign policy of the
tsarist government. During the February bourgeois-democratic
revolution they tried to save the monarchy. Occupying a
leading position in the bourgeois Provisional Government., the
Cadets pursued an anti-popular, counter-revolutionary policy
convenient to the American-Anglo-French imperialists. After
the victory of the October Socialist Revolution the Cadets

   

came out as irreconcilable enemies of Soviet power and took an
active part in all the armed actions of the
counter-revolutionaries and the campaigns of the
interventionists. After the rout of the interventionists and
white-guards the Cadets became émigrés but did
not cease their anti-Soviet counter-revolutionary activity.

This refers to the opportunist trend that developed within the
German Social-Democratic Party in the second half of the
seventies of the nineteenth century. Its chief ideologists
were Karl Höchberg, Eduard Bernstein and Karl August
Schramm, who were influenced by Duhringism. Bernstein and
Louis Viereck, along with Johann Most and others, actively
helped to spread the eclectic views of Eugen Duhring among the
German Social-Democrats. Höchberg, who, as Marx expressed
it, had “bought” his way into the Party by his
money, demanded that socialism should be made a movement of
“humanity in general” based on the “sense of
justice” of both the oppressed and the representatives
of the “upper classes”.


In Berlin, Viereck took the initiative in forming the
Mauritanian Club, in which Dürhringism prevailed and
which set itself the task of bringing  “educated
people” to  “socialism” and achieving class
collaboration between the workers and the bourgeoisie. After
the promulgation of the Anti-Socialist Law in Germany (1878),
the leaders of the Mauritanian Club migrated to Zurich where
they continued their efforts to win over the bourgeoisie to
“socialism”.
      

The opportunist, anti-Marxist character of
Höchberg’s group was clearly shown in regard to the
founding in Zurich of a central organ of the German
Social-Democratic Party. fl6chberg and his co-thinkers
considered that the newspaper should not carry out the
revolutionary policy of the Party but should limit itself to
the abstract preaching of socialist ideals. The Party
leadership—August Bebel, Wilhelm Liebknecht and
others—in fact underestimated the opportunist danger by
entrusting the publication of the newspaper to the Zurich
group.
      

In July 1879 the .Jahrbuch für Sozialissenschaft und
Social-politik (Annals of Social Science end Social
Politics), the journal edited by Höchberg, published
an article entitled  “A Retrospective Review of the
Socialist Movement in Germany”, which discussed the
revolutionary tactics of the Party. The authors of the
article—Höchberg, Schramm and
Bernstein—accused the Party of having provoked the
Anti-Socialist Law by its attacks on the bourgeoisie, and
called for alliance with and subordination to the bourgeoisie,
on the grounds that the working class was not able to
emancipate itself by its own efforts. These opportunist,
reformist views evoked sharp protest from Marx and Engels, who
rightly regarded them as a betrayal of the Party, and in
September 1879 they came out with their famous
“Circular Letter” (see K. Marx and F. Engels,

   

Selected Correspondence, Moscow, 1955, pp. 388-95).
“The result of Marx’s ‘furious’
attack,” wrote Lenin in describing the struggle of the
founders of Marxism against opportunism,  “was that the
opportunists retreated and—tade themselves scarce. In a
letter dated November 19, 1879, Marx announced that
Höchberg had been removed from the editorial committee
and that all the influential leaders of the Party—Bebel,
Liebknecht, Bracke, etc.—had repudiated his
ideas” (present edition, Vol. 12, p. 367).
      

Subsequently Hocbberg and Schramm left the workers’
movement, but Bernstein, who temporarily refrained from
advocating opportunism, became one of the leaders of German
Social-Democracy. The theoretical confusion, however, and the
opportunist position adopted by Bernstein at the end of the
seventies, were not accidental. After Engels’ death,
Bernstein openly came out with a revision of Marxism, putting
forward the opportunist slogan;  “The movement is
everything, the final goal is nothing”, which was a further
development of the basic propositions of the 1879 article.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Four: The Philosophical Idealists as Comrades-In-Arms and Successors of Empirio-Criticism )
2. How the “Empirio-Symbolist”

Yushkevich
Ridiculed the “Empirio-Criticist” Chernov


“It is, of course, amusing,” writes
Mr. P. Yushkevich, “to see how Mr. Chernov tries to make
the agnostic positivist Comtean and Spencerian, Mikhailovsky,
a forerunner of Mach and Avenarius” (op. cit., p. 73).       

First of all, what is amusing here is Mr. Yushkevich’s
astonishing ignorance. Like all Voroshilovs, he conceals this
ignorance under a display of erudite words and names. The
passage quoted is from a paragraph devoted to the relation
between Machism and Marxism. And although he undertakes to
treat of this subject, Mr. Yushkevich does not know that for
Engels (as for every materialist) the adherents of the Humean
line and the adherents of the Kantian line are equally
agnostics. Therefore, to contrast agnosticism generally with
Machism, when even Mach himself confesses to being a follower
of Hume, is simply to prove oneself an ignoramus in
philosophy. The phrase “agnostic positivism” is
also absurd, for the adherents of Hume in fact call themselves
positivists. Mr. Yushkevich, who has taken Petzoldt as his
teacher, should have known that Petzoldt definitely regards
empirio-criticism as positivism. And finally, to drag in the
names of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer is again absurd,
for Marxism rejects not what distinguishes one positivist from
another, but what is common to both and what makes a
philosopher a positivist instead of a materialist.       

Our Voroshilov needed this display of words so as to
“mesmerise” his reader, to stun him with a
cacophony of words, to distract his attention away from
the essence of the matter to empty trifles. And the
essence of the matter is the radical difference between
materialism and the broad current of positivism, which
includes Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer,

    

Mikhailovsky, a
number of Neo-Kantians, and Mach and Avenarius. The essence of
the matter has been very accurately expressed by Engels in his
Ludwig Feuerbach, where he places all the Kantians
and Humeans of that period (i.e., the eighties
of the last century) in the camp of wretched eclectics,
pettifoggers (Flohknacker : literally,
flea-crackers), and so
on.[2] To whom this
characterisation can and must apply is a question on which our
Voroshilovs did not wish to reflect. And since they are
incapable of reflecting, we shall cite one illuminating
comparison. Engels, speaking both in 1888 and 1892 of the
Kantians and Humeans in general, mentions no
names.[3] The only reference Engels makes to a
book is his reference to the work of Starcke on Feuerbach,
which Engels analysed. “Starcke,” says Engels,
“takes great pains to defend Feuerbach against the
attacks and doctrines of the vociferous lecturers who today go
by the name of philosophers in Germany. For people who are
interested in this afterbirth of German classical philosophy
this is a matter of importance; for Starcke himself it may
have appeared necessary. We, however, will spare the reader
this” (Ludwig Feuerbach,
S. 25).[4] 

Engels wanted to “spare the reader,” that is, to
save the Social-Democrats from a pleasant acquaintance with
the degenerate chatterboxes who call themselves
philosophers. And who are implied by this “afterbirth”?       

We open Starcke’s book (C. N. Starcke, Ludwig
Feuerbach, Stuttgart, 1885), and find constant references
to the adherents of Hume and Kant. Starcke
dissociates Feuerbach from these two trends. Starcke quotes in
this connection A. Riehl, Windelband and A. Lange
(pp. 3, 18-19, 127, etc., in Starcke).       

We open Avenarius’ The Human Concept of the
World, which appeared in 1891, and on page 120 of the
first German edition we read: “The final result of our
analysis concurs—although not absolutely
(durchgehend) in the measure of the various points of
view—with that reached by other investigators, for
example, E. Laas, E. Mach,
A. Riehl, W. Wundt. See
also Schopenhauer.”       

Whom was our Voroshilov-Yushkevich jeering at?       

Avenarius has not the slightest doubt as to his kinship in
principle—not regarding any particular question, but

    



regard ing the “final result” of
empirio-criticism—to the Kantians Riehl and
Laas and to the idealist Wundt. He mentions Mach
between the two Kantians. And, indeed, are they not all one
company, since Riehl and Laas purified Kant à la
Hume, and Mach and Avenarius purified Hume à la
Berkeley?       

Is it surprising that Engels wished to “spare” the
German workers, to save them from a close acquaintance with
this whole company of “flea-cracking” university
lecturers?       

Engels could spare the German workers, but the Voroshilovs do
not spare the Russian reader.       

It should be noted that an essentially eclectic combination of
Kant and Hume, or Hume and Berkeley, is possible, so to speak,
in varying proportions, by laying principal stress now on one,
now on another element of the mixture. We saw above, for
instance, that only one Machian, H. Kleinpeter, openly admits
that he and Mach are solipsists (i.e., consistent
Berkeleians). On the other hand, the Humean trend in the views
of Mach and Avenarius is emphasised by many of their disciples
and followers: Petzoldt, Willy, Pearson, the Russian
empirio-criticist Lessevich, the Frenchman Henri
Delacroix,[1]

and others. We shall cite one example—an especially
emincllt scientist who in philosophy also combined Hume with
Berkeley, but who emphasised the materialist elements of this
mixture. He is Thomas Huxley, the famous English scientist,
who gave currency to the term “agnostic” and whom
Engels undoubtedly had chiefly and primarily in mind when he
spoke of English agnosticism. Engels in 1892 called this type
of agnostics “shamefaced
materialists.”[5] James
Ward, the English spiritualist, in his book Naturalism and
Agnosticism, wherein he chiefly attacks the
“scientific champion of agnosticism,” Huxley
(Vol. II, p. 229), bears out Engels’ opinion when he
says: “In Huxley’s case indeed the leaning towards
the primacy of the physical side [“series of
elements” Mach calls it] is often so pronounced that it
can hardly be called parallelism at all. In spite

    

of his
vehement repudiation of the title of materialist as an affront
to his untarnished agnosticism, I know of few recent writers
who on occasion better deserve the title” (Vol. II,
pp. 30-3l). And James Ward quotes the following statements by
Huxley in confirmation of his opinion: “‘Anyone
who is acquainted with the history of science will admit, that
its progress has, in all ages, meant, and now more than ever
means, the extension of the province of what we call matter
and causation, and the concomitant gradual banishment from all
regions of human thought of what we call spirit and
spontaneity.’” Or: “‘It
is in itself
of little moment whether we express the phenomena of matter in
terms of spirit, or the phenomena of spirit in terms of
matter—each statement has a certain relative truth
[“relatively stable complexes of elements,”
according to Mach]. But with a view to the progress of
science, the materialistic terminology is in every way to be
preferred. For it connects thought with the other phenomena of
the universe. . . whereas the alternative, or spiritualistic,
terminology is utterly barren, and leads to nothing but
obscurity and confusion of ideas. . . . Thus there can be
little doubt, that the further science advances, the more
extensively and consistently will all the phenomena of Nature
be represented by materialistic formulae and
symbols’” (Vol. I, p. 17-19).       

So argued the “shamefaced materialist” Huxley, who
refused to accept materialism, regarding it as
“metaphysics” that illegitimately goes beyond
“groups of sensations.” And this same Huxley
wrote: “‘If I were obliged to choose between
absolute materialism and absolute idealism I should feel
compelled to accept the latter alternative. . . . Our one
certainty is the existence of the mental world’”
(J. Ward, Vol. II, p. 216).       

Huxley’s philosophy is as much a mixture of Hume and
Berkeley as is Mach’s philosophy. But in Huxley’s
case the Berkeleian streaks are incidental, and agnosticism
serves as a fig-leaf for materialism. With Mach the
“colouring” of the mixture is a different one, and
Ward, the spiritualist, while bitterly combating Huxley, pats
Avenarius and Mach affectionately on the back.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Four: The Philosophical Idealists as Comrades-In-Arms and Successors of Empirio-Criticism )
3.The Immanentists as Comrades-In-Arms of
      Mach and Avenarius

In speaking of empirio-criticism we could not avoid repeatedly
mentioning the philosophers of the so-called immanentist
school, the principal representatives of which are Schuppe,
Leclair, Rehmke, and Schubert-Soldern. It is now necessary to
examine the relation of empirio-criticism to the immanentists
and the nature of the philosophy preached by the latter.       

In 1902 Mach wrote: “. . . Today I see that a host of
philosophers—positivists, empirio-criticists, adherents
of the immanentist philosophy—as well as a very few
scientists, have all, without knowing anything of each other,
entered on new paths which, in spite of their individual
differences, converge almost towards one point”
(Analysis of Sensations, p. 9). Here we must first
note Mach’s unusually frank admission that very
few scientists are followers of the supposedly
“new,” but in truth very old, Humean-Berkeleian
philosophy. Secondly, extremely important is Mach’s
opinion that this “new” philosophy is a broad
current in which the immanentists are on the same
footing as the empirio-criticists and the
positivists. “Thus”—repeats Mach in the
introduction to the Russian translation of the Analysis of
Sensations (1906)—“there is a common
movement. . .” (p. 4). “My position [Mach says in
another place], moreover, borders closely on that of the
representatives of the immanentist philosophy. . . . I found
hardly anything in this book [i.e., W. Schuppe,
Outline of the Theory of Knowledge and Logic] with
which, with perhaps a very slight change, I would not gladly
agree” (p. 46). Mach considers that Schubert-Soldern is
also “following close paths” (p. 4), and as to
Wilhelm Schuppe, Mach even dedicates to him his
latest work, the summary so to speak of his philosophical
labours, Knowledge and Error.       

Avenarius, the other founder of empirio-criticism, wrote in
1894 that he was “gladdened” and
“encouraged” by Schuppe’s sympathy for
empirio-criticism, and that the “differences”
between him and Schuppe “exist, perhaps, only
temporarily” (vielleicht nur einstweilen noch
bestehend).[1]

And,

    

finally, J. Petzoldt, whose teachings Lessevich
regards as the last word in empirio-criticism, openly
acclaims the trio—Schuppe, Mach and
Avenarius—as the leaders of the “new”
trend. (Einführung in die Philosophie der reinen
Erfahrung, Bd. II, 1904, S. 295; Das
Weltproblem, 1906, S. v. und 146). On this point Petzoldt
is definitely opposed to Willy (Einf., II, 321),
probably the only outstanding Machian who felt ashamed of such
a kinship as Schuppe’s and who tried to dissociate
himself from him fundamentally, for which this disciple was
reprimanded by his beloved teacher Avenarius. Avenarius wrote
the words about Schuppe above quoted in a comment on
Willy’s article against Schuppe, adding that
Willy’s criticism perhaps “was put more strongly
than was really necessary” (Vierteljahrsschrift
für wissenschaftliche Philosophie, 18. Jahrg., 1894,
S. 29; which also contains Willy’s article against
Schuppe).       

Having acquainted ourselves with the empirio-criticists’
opinion of the immanentists, let us examine the
immanentists’ opinion of the empirio-criticists. We have
already mentioned the opinion uttered by Leclair in
1879. Schubert-Soldern in 1882 explicitly expressed his
“agreement” “in part with the elder
Fichte” (i.e., the distinguished representative
of subjective idealism, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, whose son was
as inept in philosophy as was the son of Joseph Dietzgen), and
“with Schuppe, Leclair, Avenarius and partly
with Rehmke,” while Mach (Die Geschichte und die
Wurzel des
Satzes von der Erhaltung der Arbeit) is cited with
particular gusto in opposition to “natural-historical
metaphysics”[2]

—the

term given to natural-historical
materialism by all the reactionary university lecturers and
professors in Germany. In 1893, after the appearance of
Avenarius’ The Human Concept of the World,
W. Schuppe hailed this work in An Open Letter to
Prof. Avenarius as a “confirmation of the
naïve realism” which he (Schuppe) himself
advocated. “My conception of thought,” Schuppe
wrote, “excellently harmonises with your
[Avenarius’] pure

    

experience.”[3]

Then, in 1896, Schubert-Soldern, summarising the
“methodological trend in philosophy” on which he
“bases himself,” traces his genealogy from
Berkeley and Hume down through F. A. Lange (“the real
beginning of our movement in Germany dates from Lange”), and
then through Laas, Schuppe and Co., Avennrius and
Mach, Riehl (among the Neo-Kantians),
Ch. Renouvier (among the Frenchmen),
etc.[4]

 Finally, in their programmatic
“Introduction” printed in the first issue of the
philosophical organ of the immanentists, alongside a
declaration of war on materialism and an expression of
sympathy with Charles Renouvier, we read: “Even in the
camp of the scientists themselves voices of individual
thinkers are being raised sermonising against the growing
arrogance of their colleagues, against the unphilosophical
spirit which has taken possession of the natural
sciences. Thus the physicist Mach. . . . On all hands fresh
forces are stirring and are working to destroy the blind faith
in the infallibility of the natural sciences, and once again
people are beginning to seek for other paths into the
profundities of the mysterious, a better entrance to the house
of
truth.”[5]


A word or two about Ch. Renouvier. He is the head of the
influential and widespread school in France known as the
neo-criticists. His theoretical philosophy is a combination of
the phenomenalism of Hume and the apriorism of Kant. The
thing-in-itself is absolutely rejected. The connection of
phenomena, order and law is declared to be a priori ;
law is written with a capital letter and is converted into the
basis of religion. The Catholic priests go into raptures over
this philosophy. The Machian Willy scornfully refers to
Renouvier as a “second apostle Paul,” as “an
obscurantist of the first water” and as a
“casuistic preacher of free will” (Gegen die
Schulweisheit, S. 129). And it is such co-thinkers of the
immanentists who warmly greet Mach’s
philosophy. When his Mechanics appeared in a French
translation, the

    

organ of the
neo-criticists—L’Année
philosophique[11]—edited by Pillon, a
collaborator and disciple of Renouvier, wrote: “It is
unnecessary to speak of the extent to which, in this criticism
of substance, the thing, the thing-in-itself, Mach’s
positive science agrees with neo-critical idealism”
(Vol. XV, 1904, p. 179).       

As for the Russian Machians, they are all ashamed of their
kinship with the immanentists, and one of course could not
expect anything else of people who did not deliberately adopt
the path of Struve, Menshikov, and the like. Bazarov alone
refers to “certain representatives of the immanentist
school” as
“realists.”[6]

Bogdanov briefly
(and in fact falsely) declares that “the
immanentist school is only an intermediate form between
Kantianism and empirio-criticism”
(Empirio-Monism, Bk. III, p. xxii). V. Chernov
writes: “Generally speaking, the immanentists approach
positivism in only one aspect of their theory, in other
aspects they go far beyond it” (Philosophical and
Sociological Studies, p. 37). Valentinov says that
“the immanentist school clothed these [Machian] ideas in
an unsuitable form and found themselves in the blind alley of
solipsism” (op. cit., p. 149). As you see, you pay your
money and take your choice: constitution and salmon
mayonnaise, realism and solipsism. Our Machians are afraid to
tell the plain and clear truth about the immanentists.       

The fact is that the immanentists are rank reactionaries, I
open advocates of fideism, unadulterated in their
obscurantism. There is not one of them who has not
frankly made his more theoretical works on
epistemology a defence of religion and a justification of
medievalism of one kind or another. Leclair, in 1879,
advocated his philosophy as one that satisfies “all the
needs of a religiously inclined mind” (Der
Realismus, etc., S. 73). J. Rehmke, in 1880,
dedicated his “theory of knowledge” to the
Protestant pastor Biedermann and closed his book by preaching
not a supersensible God, but God as a “real
concept” (it was for this reason presumably,

    

that
Bazarov ranked “certain” immanentists among the
“realists”?), and moreover the “objectivisation of
this real concept is relegated to practical life,” while
Biedermann’s “Christian dogmatism” is
declared to be a model of “scientific theology”
(J. Rehmke, Die Welt als Wahrnehmung und Begriff,
Berlin, 1880, S. 312). Schuppe in the Zeitschrift für
immanente Philosophie assures us that though the
immanentists deny the transcendental, God and the future life
do not come under this concept (Zeitschrift für
immanente Philosophie, II. Band, S. 52). In his
Ethik he insists on the “connection of the
moral law . . . with the metaphysical world conception”
and condemns the separation of the church from the state as a
“senseless phrase” (Dr. Wilhelm Schuppe,
Grundzüge der Ethik und Rechtsphilosophie [Principles
of Ethics and the Philosophy of Law], Breslau, 1881,
S. 181, 325). Schubert-Soldern in his Foundations of the Theory
of
Cognition[7]

deduces both the pre-existence of the
self before the body and the after-existence of the
self after the body, i.e.,the immortality of
the soul (op. cit., p. 82), etc. In The Social

Question,[8]

arguing against Bebel, he defends,
together with “social reforms,” suffrage based on
class distinction, and says that the “Social-Democrats
ignore the fact that without the divine gift of unhappiness
there could be no happiness” (p. 330), and thereupon
laments the fact that materialism “prevails”
(p. 242): “he who in our time believes in a life beyond,
or even in its possibility, is considered a fool”
(ibid.).       

And German Menshikovs like these, no less obscurantists of the
first water than Renouvier, live in lasting concubinage with
the empirio-criticists. Their theoretical kinship is in
contestable. There is no more Kantianism in the immanentists
than in Petzoldt or Pearson. We saw above that they themselves
regard themselves as disciples of Hume and Berkeley, an
opinion of the immanentists that is generally recognised in
philosophical literature. In order to show clearly what
epistemological premises these comrades-in-arms of Mach and
Avenarius proceed from, we shall quote some fundamental
theoretical propositions from the works of immanentists.       
 

Leclair in 1879 had not yet invented the term
“immanent,” which really signifies
“experiential,” “given in experience,”
and which is just as spurious a label for concealing
corruption as the labels of the European bourgeois parties. In
his first work, Leclair frankly and explicitly calls himself a
“critical idealist” (Der
Realismus, etc., S. 11, 21, 206, etc.). In this
work he criticises Kant, as we have already seen, for his
concessions to materialism, and clearly indicates his
wn path away from Kant to Fichte and
Berkeley. Leclair fights materialism in general and the
tendency towards materialism displayed by the majority of
scientists in particular as mercilessly as Schuppe,
Schubert-Soldern and Rehmke.       

“If we return,” Leclair says, “to the
standpoint of critical idealism, if we do not attribute a
transcendental existence [i.e., an existence outside
of human consciousness] to nature or the processes of nature,
then for the subject the aggregate of bodies and his own body,
in so far as he can see and feel it, together with all its
changes, will be a directly given phenomenon of spatially
connected co-existences and successions in time, and the whole
explanation of nature will reduce itself to stating the laws
of these co-existences and successions” (p. 21).       

Back to Kant!—said the reactionary Neo-Kantians. Back to
Fichte and Berkeley!—is essentially what the
reactionary immanentists are saying. For Leclair, all that
exists consists of “complexes of sensations”
(p. 38), while certain classes of properties
(Eigenschaften), which act upon our sense-organs, he
designates, for example, by the letter M, and other classes,
which act upon other objects of nature, by the letter N
(p. 150, etc.). Moreover, Leclair speaks of nature as the
“phenomena of the consciousness”
(Bewusstseinsphänomen) not of a single person, but of
“mankind” (pp. 55-56). If we remember that Leclair
published his book in Prague, where Mach was professor of
physics, and that Leclair cites with rapture only Mach’s
Erhaltung der Arbeit, which appeared in 1872, the
question involuntarily arises: ought we not to regard the
advocate of fideism and frank idealist Leclair as the true
progenitor of the “original” philosophy of Mach?       
 

As for Schuppe, who, according to
Leclair,[9]

 arrived at
the “same results,” he, as we have seen, really
claims to defend “naïve realism,” and in his
Open Letter to Prof. Avenarius bitterly
complains of the “established perversion of my
[Schuppe’s] theory of knowledge to subjective
idealism.” The true nature of the crude forgery which
the immanentist Schuppe calls a defence of realism is quite
clear from his rejoinder to Wundt, who did not hesitate to
class the immanentists with the Fichteans, the subjective
idealists (Philosophische Studien,
loc. cit., S. 386, 397, 407).       

“In my case,” Schuppe retorts to Wundt,
“the proposition ‘being is consciousness’
means that consciousness without the external world is
inconceivable, that the latter belongs to the former,
i.e.,the absolute connection
(Zusammengehörigkeit) of the one with the other,
which I have so often asserted and explained and in which the
two constitute the primary whole of
being.”[10]


One must be extremely naïve not to discern unadulterated
subjective idealism in such “realism”! Just think: the
external world “belongs to consciousness” and is
in absolute connection with it! The poor professor
was indeed slandered by the “established” practice
of ranking him with the subjective idealists! Such a
philosophy completely coincides with Avenarius’
“principal co-ordination”; no reservations and protests
on the part of Chernov and Valentinov can sunder them; both
philosophies will be consigned together to the museum of
reactionary fabrications of German professordom. As a
curiosity once more testifying to Valentinov’s lack of
judgment, let us note that he calls Schuppe a solipsist (it
goes without saying that Schuppe vowed and swore that he was
not a solipsist—and wrote special articles to this
effect—just as vehemently as did Mach, Petzoldt, and
Co.), yet is highly delighted with Bazarov’s article in
the Studies ! I should like to translate into German
Bazarov’s dictum that “sense-perception is the
reality existing outside us” and forward it to some more
or less intelligent immanentist. He would embrace and kiss
Bazarov as heartily as the Schuppes, Leclairs

    

and
Schubert-Solderns embraced Mach and Avenarius. For
Bazarov’s dictum is the alpha and omega of the
doctrines of the immanentist school.       

And here, lastly, is Schubert-Soldern. “The materialism
of natural science,” the “metaphysics” of
recognising the objective reality of the external world, is
the chief enemy of this philosopher (Grundlagen einer
Erkenntnistheorie, 1884, p. 31 and the whole of Chapter
II: “The Metaphysics of Natural
Science”). “Natural science abstracts from all relations
of consciousness” (p. 52)—that is the chief evil
(and that is just what constitutes materialism!). For the
individual cannot escape from “sensations and, hence,
from a state of consciousness” (pp. 33-34). Of course,
Schubert-Soldern admitted in 1896, my standpoint is
epistemological solipsism (Die soziale Frage, S. x),
but not “metaphysical,” not
“practical” solipsism. “What is given us
immediately is sensations, complexes of constantly changing
sensations” (Ueber Transcendenz des Objekts und
Subjekts, S. 73).       

“Marx took the material process of production,”
says Schubert-Soldern, “as the cause of inner processes
and motives, in the same way (and just as falsely) as natural
science regards the common [to humanity] external world as the
cause of the individual inner worlds” (Die soziale
Frage, S. xviii). That Marx’s historical
materialism is connected with natural-historical materialism
and philosophical materialism in general, it does not even
occur to this comrade in-arms of Mach to doubt.       

“Many, perhaps the majority, will be of the opinion that
from the standpoint of epistemological solipsism no
metaphysics is possible, i.e.,that metaphysics is
always transcendental. Upon more mature reflection I cannot
concur with this opinion. Here are my reasons. . . . The
immediate foundation of all that is given is the spiritual
(solipsist) connection, the central point of which is the
individual self (the individual realm of thought)
with its body. The rest of the world is inconceivable without
this self, just as this self is
inconceivable without the rest of the world. With the
destruction of the individual self the world is also
annihilated, which appears impossible—and with the
destruction of the rest of the world, nothing remains for my
individual self, for the latter can be separated from
the world

    

only logically, but not in time and space. Therefore
my individual self must continue to exist after my
death also, if the entire world is not to be annihilated with
it. . .” (ibid., p. xxiii).       

The “principal co-ordination,” “complexes of
sensations” and the rest of the Machian banalities
render faithful service to the proper people!       

“. . . What is the hereafter (das Jenseits)
from the solipsist point of view? It is only a possible future
experience for me. . .”
(ibid.). “Spiritualism . . . would be obliged
to prove the existence of the Jenseits. But at any rate the
materialism of natural science cannot be brought into the
field against spiritualism, for this materialism, as we have
seen, is only one aspect of the world process within the
all-embracing spiritual connection” ( = the
“principal co-ordination”) (p. xxiv).       

All this is said in that philosophical introduction to Die
soziale Frage (1896) wherein Schubert-Soldern all the
time appears arm in arm with Mach and Avenarius. Only for
the handful of Russian Machians does Machism serve exclusively
for purposes of intellectual prattle. In its native country
its role as a flunkey to fideism is openly proclaimed!

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Four: The Philosophical Idealists as Comrades-In-Arms and Successors of Empirio-Criticism )
4. Whither is Empirio-Criticism
Tending?

Let us now cast a glance at the development of Machism after
Mach and Avenarius. We have seen that their philosophy is a
hash, a pot-pourri of contradictory and disconnected
epistemological propositions. We must now examine how and
whither, i.e.,in what direction, this philosophy is
developing, for this will help us to settle certain
“disputable” questions by referring to
indisputable historical facts. And indeed, in view of the
eclecticism and incoherence of the initial philosophical
premises of the trend we are examining, varying
interpretations of it and sterile disputes over particulars
and trifles are absolutely inevitable. But empirio-criticism,
like every ideological current, is a living thing, which grows
and develops, and the fact that it is growing in one direction
or another will help us more than long arguments to settle the
basic question as to what the real essence of this
philosophy is. We judge a person not by what

    

he says or thinks
of himself but by his actions. And we must judge philosophers
not by the labels they give themselves (“positivism,”
the philosophy of “pure experience,”
“monism” or “empirio-monism,” the
“philosophy of natural science,” etc.) but by the
manner in which they actually settle fundamental theoretical
questions, by their associates, by what they are teaching and
by what they have taught their disciples and followers.       

It is this last question which interests us now. Everything
essential was said by Mach and Avenarius more than twenty
years ago. It was bound to become clear in the interval
how these “leaders” were
understood by those who wanted to understand them,
and whom they themselves (at least Mach, who has outlived his
colleague) regard as their successors. To be specific, let us
take those who themselves claim to be disciples of Mach and
Avenarius (or their adherents) and whom Mach himself ranks as
such. We shall thus obtain a picture of empirio-criticism as a
philosophical current, and not as a collection of
literary oddities.       

In Mach’s Introduction to the Russian translation of the
Analysis of Sensations, Hans Cornelius is recommended
as a “young investigator” who is following
“if not quite the same, at least very close paths”
(p. 4). In the text of the Analysis of Sensations
Mach once again “mentions with pleasure the works”
of Cornelius and others, “who have disclosed the kernel
of Avenarius’ ideas and have developed them
further” (p. 48). Let us take Cornelius’
Introduction to the
Philosophy[1]

and we find that its author
also speaks of his endeavour to follow in the footsteps of
Mach and Avenarius (pp. viii, 32). We have before us then a
disciple acknowledged by the teacher. This disciple
also begins with sensations-elements (pp. 17, 24),
categorically declares that he confines himself to experience
(p. vi), calls his views “consistent or epistemological
empiricism” (p. 335), emphatically condemns the
“one sidedness” of idealism and the
“dogmatism” of both the idealists and the
materialists (p. 129), vehemently denies the possible
“misconception” (p. 123) that his philosophy
implies the recognition of the world as existing in the mind
of man, flirts with naïve realism no

    

less skilfully than
Avenarius, Schuppe or Bazarov (“a visual, as well as every
other sense perception, is located where we find it, and only
where we find it, that is to say, where the
naïvenaïve mind, untouched by a false philosophy,
localises it”—p. 125)—and this disciple,
acknowledged as such by his teacher, arrives at
immortality and
God. Materialism—thunders this police sergeant
in a professorial chair, I beg your pardon, this disciple of
the “recent positivists”—converts man into an
automaton. “It need hardly be said that together with
the belief in the freedom of our decisions it destroys all
considerations of the moral value of our actions and our
responsibility for them. Just as little room is left for the
idea of the continuation of our life after death”
(p. 116). The final note of the book is:

Education (or the youth stultified by this man of science
presumably) is necessary not only for action but “above
all . . . to inculcate veneration (Ehrfurcht) not for
the transitory values of a fortuitous tradition, but for the
imperishable values of duty and beauty, for the divine
(dem Göttlichen) within us and without”
(p. 357).       

Compare this with Bogdanov’s assertion that “there
is absolutely no room” (Bogdanov’s
italics) and “there cannot be any room” for the
idea of God, freedom of the will and immortality of the soul
in Mach’s philosophy in view of his denial of every
“thing-in-itself” (p. xii). While Mach in this
same book (p. 293) declares that “there is no Machian
philosophy,” and recommends not only the immanentists,
but also Cornelius who had disclosed the kernel of
Avenarius’ ideas! Thus, in the first place, Bogdanov
absolutely does not know the “Machian
philosophy” as a current which not only nestles under
the wing of fideism, but which itself goes to the length of
fideism. In the second place, Bogdanov absolutely does not
know the history of philosophy; for to associate a denial
of the ideas mentioned above with a denial of the
thing-in-itself is to insult the history of philosophy. Will
Bogdanov take it into his head to deny that all consistent
followers of Hume, by rejecting every kind of thing-in-itself,
do leave room for these ideas? Has Bogdanov never
heard of the subjective idealists, who reject every kind of
thing in-itself and thereby make room for these ideas?
“There can be no room” for

    

these ideas
solely in a philosophy that teaches that nothing
exists but perceptual being, that the world is matter in
motion, that the external world, the physical world familiar
to all, is the sole objective reality—i.e.,in
the philosophy of materialism. And it is for this, precisely
for this, that materialism is combated by the immanentists
recommended by Mach, by Mach’s disciple Cornelius, and
by modern professorial philosophy in general.       

Our Machians began to repudiate Cornelius only after this
indecency had been pointed out to them. Such repudiations are
not worth much. Friedrich Adler evidently has not been
“warned,” and therefore recommends this Cornelius
in a socialist journal (Der Kampf, 1908, 5, S. 235:
“a work that is easy to read and highly to be
commended”). Through the medium of Machism, downright
philosophical reactionaries and preachers of fideism are
palmed off on the workers as teachers!       

Petzoldt, without having been warned, detected the falsity in
Cornelius: but his method of combating this falsity is a
gem. Listen to this: “To assert that the world is idea
[as is asserted by the idealists—whom we are combating,
no joke!] has sense only when it implies that it is the idea
of the predicator, or, if you like, of all predicators,
i.e.,that its existence depends exclusively upon the
thought of that individual or of those individuals; it exists
only inasmuch as he thinks about it, and what he does not
think of does not exist. We, on the contrary, make the world
dependent not upon the thought of an individual or
individuals, or, to put it better and clearer, not upon the
act of thinking, or upon any actual thought, but—and
exclusively in the logical sense—upon thought in
general. The idealist confuses one with the other, and the
result is agnostic semi-solipsism, as we observe it in
Cornelius” (Einführung, II, 317).       

Stolypin denied the existence of the cabinets
noirs![5]
Petzoldt annihilates the idealists! It is truly astonishing
how much this annihilation of idealism resembles a
recommendation to the idealists to exercise more skill in
concealing their idealism. To say that the world depends upon
man’s thought is perverted idealism. To say that the
world depends upon thought in general is recent positivism,
critical realism—in a word, thoroughgoing bourgeois
charlatanism!

    

If Cornelius is an agnostic semi-solipsist,
Petzoldt is a solipsist semi-agnostic. You are cracking a
flea, gentlemen!       

Let us proceed. In the second edition of his Erkenntnis
und Irrtum, Mach says: “A systematic exposition [of
Mach’s views], one to which in all its essentials I can
subscribe, is given by Professor Dr. Hans Kleinpeter”
(Die Erkenntnistheorie der Naturforschung der
Gegenwart, Leipzig, 1905: The Theory of Knowledge of
Modern Natural Science). Let us take Hans Number
Two. This professor is an accredited disseminator of Machism:
a pile of articles on Mach’s views in philosophical
journals, both in German and in English, translations of works
recommended by Mach with introductions by Mach—in a
word, the right hand of the “teacher.” Here are
his views: “. . . All my (outer and inner) experience,
all my thoughts and aspirations are given me as a psychical
process, as a part of my consciousness”
(op. cit. p. 18). “That which we call physical is a
construction of psychical elements”
(p. 144). “Subjective conviction, not
objective certainty (Gewissheit) is the only
attainable goal of any science” (p. 9). (The
italics are Kleinpeter’s, who adds the following remark:
“Something similar was already said by Kant in the
Critique of Practical Reason.”) “The assumption
that there are other minds is one which can never be confirmed
by experience” (p. 42). “I do not
know. . . whether, in general, there exist other
selves outside of myself” (p. 43). In § 5,
entitled “Activity (Spontaneity) in
Consciousness,” we read that in the case of the
animal-automaton the succession of ideas is purely
mechanical. The same is true of us when we dream. “The
quality of our consciousness in its normal state essentially
differs from this. It possesses a property which these [the
automata] entirely lack, and which it would be very difficult,
to say the least, to explain mechanically or automatically:
the so-called self-activity of the self. Every person
can dissever himself from his states of consciousness, he can
manipulate them, can make them stand out more clearly or force
them into the background, can analyse them, compare various
parts, etc. All this is a fact of (immediate) experience. Our
self is therefore essentially different from the
sum-total of the states of consciousness and cannot be put as
an equivalent of it. Sugar consists of carbon, hydrogen

    

and
oxygen; were we to attribute a soul to it, then by analogy it
would have to possess the faculty of directing the movement of
the hydrogen, oxygen and carbon at will”
(pp. 29–30). § 4 of the following chapter is headed:
“The Act of Cognition—an Act of Will
(Willenshandlung).” “It must be regarded
as definitely established that all my psychical experiences
are divisible into two large main groups: compulsory acts and
deliberate acts. To the former belong all impressions of the
external world” (p. 47). “That it is possible to
advance several theories regarding one and the same realm of
facts . . . is as well known to physicists as it is
incompatible with the premises of an absolute theory of
knowledge. And this fact is also linked with the volitional
character of our thought; it also implies that our volition is
not bound by external circumstances” (p. 50).       

Now judge how bold Bogdanov was in asserting that in
Mach’s philosophy “there is absolutely no room for
free will,” when Mach himself recommends such a specimen
as Kleinpeter! We have already seen that the latter does not
attempt to conceal either his own idealism or Mach’s. In
1898-99 Kleinpeter wrote: “Hertz proclaims the same
subjectivist view [i.e., as Mach] of the nature of
our concepts. . . . If Mach and Hertz [with what justice
Kleinpeter here implicates the famous physicist we shall soon
see] deserve credit from the standpoint of idealism for having
emphasised the subjective origin of all our concepts
and of the connections between them—and not only of
certain individual ones—from the standpoint of
empiricism they deserve no less credit for having acknowledged
that experience alone, as a court entirely independent of
thought, can solve the question of their correctness”
(Archiv für systematische Philosophie, Bd. V,
1898-99, S. 169-70). In 1900 he wrote that in spite of all the
points on which Mach differs from Kant and Berkeley,
“they at any rate are more akin to him than the
metaphysical empiricism prevailing in natural science
[i.e., materialism! The professor does not like to
call the devil by name] which is indeed the main target of
Mach’s attacks” (op. cit., Bd. VI, S. 87). In 1903
he wrote: “The starting point of Berkeley and Mach is
irrefutable. . . . Mach completed what Kant began”
(Kantstudien, Bd. VIII, 1903, S. 314, 274).       
 

In the preface to the Russian edition of the Analysis of
Sensations Mach also mentions T. Ziehen, “who is
following, if not the same, at least very close paths.”
We take Professor Theodor Ziehen’s book The
Psychophysiological Theory of Knowledge (Psychophysiologische
Erkenntnistheorie, Jena, 1898) and hnd that the author
refers to Mach, Avenarius, Schuppe, and so forth in the very
introduction. Here therefore we again have a case of a
disciple acknowledged by the teacher. Ziehen’s
“recent” theory is that only the “mob”
is capable of believing that “real objects evoke our
sensations” (p. 3), and that “over the portals of
the theory of knowledge there can be no other inscription than
the words of Berkeley: ‘The external objects subsist not
by themselves, but exist in our minds!’”
(p. 5). “What is given us is sensations and ideas. Both
are embraced by the word psychical. Non-psychical is a word
devoid of meaning” (p. 100). The laws of nature are
relations not of material bodies but of “reduced
sensations” (p. 104. This “new”
concept—“reduced sensations”—contains everything
that is original in Ziehen’s Berkeleianismt).       

Petzoldt repudiated Ziehen as an idealist as far back as 1904
in the second volume of his Introduction
(S. 298-301). By 1906 he had already included Cornelius,
Kleinpeter, Ziehen and Verworn (Das Weltproblem,
etc., S. 137 Fussnote) in the list of idealists
or psychomonists. In the case of all these worthy
professors, you see, there is a “misconception” in
their interpretations “of the views of Mach and
Avenarius” (ibid .).       

Poor Mach and Avenarius! Not only were they slandered by their
enemies for idealism and “even” (as Bogdanov
expresses it) solipsism, but their very friends, disciples and
followers, expert professors, also understood their teachers
pervertedly, in an idealist sense. If empirio-criticism is
developing into idealism, that by no means demonstrates the
radical falsity of its muddled Berkeleian basic premises. God
forbid! It is only a slight “misconception,” in
the
Nozdriev-Petzoldt[6] sense of the term.       

The funniest thing of all perhaps is that Petzoldt himself,
the guardian of purity and innocence, firstly,
“supplemented” Mach and Avenarius with his
“logical a priori” and, secondly,
coupled them with Wilhelm Schuppe, the vehicle of fideism.

 

Had Petzoldt been acquainted with Mach’s English
adherents he would have had very considerably to extend the
list of Machians who had lapsed (because of a
“misconception”) into idealism. We have already referred
to Karl Pearson, whom Mach praised, as an unadulterated
idealist. Here are the opinions of two other
“slanderers” who say the same thing of Pearson:
“Professor Pearson is merely echoing a doctrine first
given clear utterance by the truly great Berkeley”
(Howard V. Knox, Mind, Vol. VI, 1897,
p. 205). “There can be no doubt that Mr. Pearson is an
idealist in the strictest sense of the word” (Georges
Rodier, Revue
philosophique,[7] 1888, II, Vol. 26,
p. 200). The English idealist, William Clifford, whom Mach regards
as “coming very
close” to his philosophy (Analysis of
Sensations, p. 8), must be considered a teacher rather
than a disciple of Mach, for Clifford’s philosophical
works appeared in the seventies. Here the
“misconception” is due to Mach himself, who in
1901 “failed to notice” the idealism in
Clifford’s doctrine that the world is
“mind-stuff,” a “social object,” a
“highly organised experience,” and so
forth.[2]

For
a characterisation of the charlatanism of the German Machians,
it is sufficient to note that Kleinpeter in 1905 elevated this
idealist to the rank of founder of the “epistemology of
modern science”!       

On page 284 of the Analysis of Sensations, Mach
mentions the “kindred” (to Buddhism and Machism)
American philosopher, Paul Carus. Carus, who calls himself an
“admirer and personal friend” of Mach, edits in
Chicago The Monist, a journal devoted to philosophy,
and The Open
Court,[8] a journal devoted to the
propagation of religion. “Science is divine
revelation,” say the editors of this popular little
journal, and they express the opinion that science can bring
about a reform of the church that will retain “all that
is true and good in religion.” Mach is a regular
contributor to The Monist and publishes in it
individual chapters from his latest works. Carus corrects Mach
“ever so little” à la Kant, and
declares that Mach “is an idealist or, as we would

    

say,
a subjectivist.” “There are, no doubt, differences
between Mach’s views and mine,” although “I
at once recognised in him a kindred
spirit”.[3]

“Our Monism,” says
Carus, “is not materialistic, not spiritualistic, not
agnostic; it merely means consistency . . . it takes
experience as its basis and employs as method the systematic
forms of the relations of cxperience” (evidently a
plagiarism from Bogclanov’s Empirio-Monism !)
. Carus’ motto is: “Not agnosticism, but positive
science, not mysticism, but clear thinking, not
supernaturalism, not materialism, but a monistic view of the
world, not a dogma, but religion, not creed, but faith.”
And in conformity with this motto Carus preaches a “new
theology,” a “scientific theology,” or
theonomy, which denies the literalness of the bible but
insists that “all truth is divine and God reveals
himself in science as he does in
history.”[4]

It should be remarked that Kleinpeter, in his book on
the theory of knowledge of modern science already referred to,
recommends Carus, together with Ostwald, Avenarius and the
immanentists (pp. 151-52). When Haeckel issued his theses for
a Monistic Alliance, Carus vigorously opposed him on the
ground that, first, Haeckel vainly attempts to refute
apriorism, which is “quite in keeping with scientific
philosophy”; second, that Haeckel’s doctrine of
determinism “excludes the possibility of free will”;
third, that Haeckel is mistaken “in emphasising the
one-sided view of the naturalist against the traditional
conservatism of the churches. Thus he appears as an enemy to
the existing churches instead of rejoicing at their higher
development into a new and truer interpretation of their
dogmas . . .” (ibid., Vol. XVI, 1906,
p. 122). Carus himself admits that “I appear reactionary
to many freethinkers who blame me for not joining their chorus
in denouncing all religion as superstition” (p. 355).       

It is quite evident that we have here a leader of a gang of
American literary fakers who are engaged in doping the people
with religious opium. Mach and Kleinpeter joined this gang
evidently as the result of a slight
“misconception.”

Lenin: 1908/mec: 5. A. Bogdanov's 'Empirio-Monism'







V.I. Lenin
MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Four: The Philosophical Idealists as Comrades-In-Arms and Successors of Empirio-Criticism )
5. A. Bogdanov’s “Empirio-Monism”

“I personally,” writes Bogdanov of himself,
“know so far of only one empirio-monist in
literature—a certain A. Bogdanov. But I know him very
well and can answer for it that his views fully accord with
the sacramental formula of the primacy of nature over mind. To
wit, he regards all that exists as a continuous chain of
development, the lower links of which are lost in the chaos of
elements, while the higher links, known to us, represent the
experience of men [Bogdanov’s
italics]—psychical and, still higher, physical
experience. This experience, and the knowledge resulting
therefrom, correspond to what is usually called mind”
(Empirio-Monism, III, xii).       


The “sacramental” formula here ridiculed by
Bogdanov is the well-known proposition of Engels, whom
Bogdanov, however, diplomatically avoids mentioning! We do not
differ from Engels, oh, no!       

But let us examine more carefully Bogdanov’s own summary
of his famous “empirio-monism” and
“substitution.” The physical world is called the
experience of men and it is declared that physical
experience is “higher” in the chain of
development than psychical. But this is utter nonsense! And it
is precisely the kind of nonsense that is characteristic of
all idealist philosophies. It is simply farcical for Bogdanov
to class this “system” as materialism. With me,
too, he says, nature is primary and mind secondary. If
Engels’ definition is to be thus construed, then Hegel
is also a materialist, for with him, too, psychical experience
(under the title of the Absolute Idea) comes first, then
follow, “higher up,” the physical world, nature,
and, lastly, human knowledge, which through nature apprehends
the Absolute Idea. Not a single idealist will deny the primacy
of nature taken in this sense for it is not a genuine primacy,
since in fact nature is not taken as the immediately
given, as the starting point of epistemology. Nature is in
fact reached as the result of a long process through
abstraction of the “psychical.” It is
immaterial what these abstractions are called: whether
Absolute Idea, Universal Self, World Will, and so on and so
forth. These terms distinguish the different varieties of
idealism, and such varieties exist in countless

    

numbers. The
essence of idealism is that the psychical is taken as the
starting point; from it external nature is deduced, and
only then is the ordinary human consciousness deduced
from nature. Hence, this primary “psychical”
always turns out to be a lifeless abstraction
concealing a diluted theology. For instance, everybody knows
what a human idea is; but an idea independent of man
and prior to man, an idea in the abstract, an Absolute Idea,
is a theological invention of the idealist Hegel. Everybody
knows what human sensation is; but sensation independent of
man, sensation prior to man, is nonsense, a lifeless
abstraction, an idealist artifice. And it is precisely to such
an idealistic artifice that Bogdanov resorts when he erects
the following ladder.       

1)The chaos of “elements” (we know that no other
          human concept lies back of the term “element”
          save sensation).       

2)The psychical experience of men.       

3)The physical experience of men.       

4) “The knowledge emerging therefrom.”       

There are no sensations (human) without man. Hence, the first
rung of this ladder is a lifeless idealist abstraction. As a
matter of fact, what we have here is not the usual and
familiar human sensations, but fictitious sensations,
nobody’s sensations, sensations in
general, divine sensations—just as the ordinary
human idea became divine with Hegel when it was divorced from
man and man’s brain.       

So away with the first rung!       

Away also with the second rung, for the psychical
before the physical (and Bogdanov places the second rung
before the third) is something unknown to man or
science. The physical realm existed before the psychical could
have appeared, for the latter is the highest product of the
highest forms of organic matter. Bogdanov’s second rung
is also a lifeless abstraction, it is thought without brain,
human reason divorced from man.       

Only when we throw out the hrst two rungs, and only then, can
we obtain a picture of the world that truly corresponds to
science and materialism. To wit: 1) the physical world exists
independently of the mind of man and existed long
prior to man, prior to any “human
experience”;

    

2) the psychical, the mind, etc., is the highest
product of matter (i.e., the physical), it is a
function of that particularly complex fragment of matter
called the human brain.       

“The realm of substitution,” writes Bogdanov,
“coincides with the realm of physical phenomena; for the
psychical phenomena we need substitute nothing, because they
are immediate complexes” (p. xxxix).       

And this precisely is idealism; for the psychical,
i.e.,consciousness, idea, sensation, etc., is taken
as the immediate and the physical is deduced from it,
substituted for it. The world is the non-ego created
by the ego, said Fichte. The world is absolute idea,
said Hegel. The world is will, said Schopenhauer. The world is
conception and idea, says the immanentist Rehmke. Being is
consciousness, says the immanentist Schuppe. The physical is a
substitution for the psychical, says Bogdanov. One must be
blind not to perceive the identical idealist essence under
these various verbal cloaks.       

“Let us ask ourselves the following question,”
writes Bogdanov in Book I of Empirio-Monism
(pp. 128-29): “What is a ‘living being,’ for
instance, ‘man’?” And he answers:
“‘Man’ is primarily a definite complex of
‘immediate experiences.’ [Mark,
“primarily”!] Then, in the
further development of experience, ‘man’ becomes
both for himself and for others a physical body amidst other
physical bodies.”       

Why, this is a sheer “complex” of absurdities, fit
only for deducing the immortality of the soul, or the idea of
God, and so forth. Man is primarily a complex of immediate
experiences and in the course of further development
becomes a physical body! That means that there are
“immediate experiences” without a
physical body, prior to a physical body! What a pity
that this magnificent philosophy has not yet found acceptance
in our theological seminaries! There its merits would have
been fully appreciated.       

“. . . We have admitted that physical nature itself is a
product [Bogdanov’s italics] of complexes of an
immediate character (to which psychical co-ordinations also
belong), that it is the reflection of such complexes in
others, analogous to them, but of the most complex type (in
the socially organised experience of living beings)”
(p. 146).       
 

A philosophy which teaches that physical nature itself is a
product, is a philosophy of the priests pure and simple. And
its character is in no wise altered by the fact that
personally Bogdanov emphatically repudiates all
religion. Dühring was also an atheist; he even proposed
to prohibit religion in his “socialitarian”
order. Nevertheless, Engels was absolutely right in pointing
out that Dühring’s “system” could not
make ends meet without
religion.[1] The same is true of
Bogdanov, with the essential difference that the quoted
passage is not a chance inconsistency but the very essence of
his “empirio-monism” and of all his
“substitution.” If nature is a product, it is
obvious that it can be a product only of some thing that is
greater, richer, broader, mightier than nature, of something
that exists; for in order to “produce” nature, it
must exist independently of nature. That means that something
exists outside nature, something which moreover
produces nature. In plain language this is called
God. The idealist philosophers have always sought to change
this latter name, to make it more abstract, more vague and at
the same time (for the sake of plausibility) to bring it
nearer to the “psychical,” as an “immediate
complex,” as the immediately given which requires no
proof. Absolute Idea, Universal Spirit, World Will,
“general substitution” of the psychical
for the physical, are different formulations of one and the
same idea. Every man knows, and science investigates, idea,
mind, will, the psychical, as a function of the normally
operating human brain. To divorce this function from substance
organised in a definite way, to convert this function into a
universal, general abstraction, to “substitute”
this abstraction for the whole of physical nature, this is the
raving of philosophical idealism and a mockery of science.       

Materialism says that the “socially-organised experience
of living beings” is a product of physical nature, a
result of a long development of the latter, a development from
a state of physical nature when no society, organisation,
experience, or living beings existed or could have
existed. Idealism says that physical nature is a product of
this experience of living beings, and in saying this, idealism
is equating (if not subordinating) nature to God. For God is
undoubtedly a product of the socially-organised experience

    

of
living beings. No matter from what angle you look at it,
Bogdanov’s philosophy contains nothing but a reactionary
muddle.       

Bogdanov thinks that to speak of the social organisation of
experience is “cognitive socialism” (Bk. III,
p. xxxiv). This is insane twaddle. If socialism is thus
regarded, the Jesuits are ardent adherents of “cognitive
socialism,” for the basis of their epistemology is
divinity as “socially-organised experience.” And
there can be no doubt that Catholicism is a socially-organised
experience; only, it reflects not objective truth (which
Bogdanov denies, but which science reflects), but the
exploitation of the ignorance of the masses by definite social
classes.
    

But why speak of the Jesuits! We find Bogdanov’s
“cognitive socialism” in its entirety among the
immanentists, so beloved of Mach. Leclair regards nature as
the consciousness of “mankind” (Der
Realismus, etc., S. 55), and not of the
individual. The bourgeois philosophers will serve you up any
amount of such Fichtean cognitive socialism. Schuppe also
emphasises das generische, das
gattungsmässige Moment des Bewusstseins
(Vierteljahrsschrift für wissenschaftliche
Philosophie, Bd. XVII, S. 379-80), i.e.,the
general, the generic factor of consciousness. To think that
philosophical idealism vanishes when the consciousness of
mankind is substituted for the consciousness of the
individual, or the socially-organised experience for the
experience of one person, is like thinking that capitalism
vanishes when one capitalist is replaced by a joint-stock
company.       

Our Russian Machians, Yushkevich and Valentinov, echo the
materialist Rakhmetov in asserting that Bogdanov is an
idealist (at the same time foully abusing Rakhmetov
himself). But they could not stop to think where this idealism
came from. They make out that Bogdanov is an individual and
chance phenomenon, an isolated case. This is not
true. Bogdanov personally may think that he has invented an
“original” system, but one has only to compare him
with the afore mentioned disciples of Mach to realise the
falsity of such an opinion. The difference between Bogdanov
and Cornelius is far less than the difference between
Cornelius and Carus. The difference between Bogdanov and Carus
is less (as far as their philosophical systems are

    

concerned,
of course, and not the deliberateness of their reactionary
implications) than the difference between Carus and Ziehen,
and so on. Bogdanov is only one of the manifestations of that
“socially-organised experience” which testifies to
the growth of Machism into idealism. Bogdanov (we are here, of
course, speaking exclusively of Bogdanov as a philosopher)
could not have come into God’s world had the doctrines
of his teacher Mach contained no “elements”. . . of
Berkeleianism. And I cannot imagine a more “terrible
vengeance” on Bogdanov than to have his
Empirio-Monism translated, say, into German and
presented for review to Leclair and Schubert-Soldern,
Cornelius and Kleinpeter, Carus and Pillon (the French
collaborator and disciple of Renouvier). The compliments that
would be paid by these outright comrades-in-arms and, at
times, direct followers of Mach to the
“substitution” would be much more eloquent than
their arguments.       

However, it would scarcely be correct to regard
Bogdanov’s philosophy as a finished and static
system. In the nine years from 1899 to 1908, Bogdanov has gone
through four stages in his philosophical peregrinations. At
the beginning he was a “natural-historical”
materialist (i.e., semi-consciously and instinctively
faithful to the spirit of science). His Fundamental
Elements of the Historical Outlook on Nature bears
obvious traces of that stage. The second stage was the
“energetics” of Ostwald, which was so fashionable
in the latter nineties, a muddled agnosticism which at
times stumbled into idealism. From Ostwald (the title page of
Ostwald’s Lectures on Natural Philosophy bears
the inscription: “Dedicated to E. Mach”) Bogdanov went
over to Mach, that is, he borrowed the fundamental premises of
a subjective idealism that is as inconsistent and muddled as
Mach’s entire philosophy. The fourth stage is an attempt
to eliminate some of the contradictions of Machism, and to
create a semblance of objective idealism. “The theory of
general substitution” shows that Bogdanov has described
a curve of almost 180&degr from his starting position. Is this
stage of Bogdanov’s philosophy more remote or less
remote from dialectical materialism than the previous stages?
If Bogdanov remains in one place, then he is, of course, more
remote. If he keeps moving along the same curve in

    

which he
has been moving for the last nine years, he is less remote. He
now has only one serious step to make in order to
return once more to materialism, namely, universally to
discard his whole universal substitution. For this universal
substitution gathers into one Chinese pigtail all the
transgressions of half-hearted idealism and all the weaknesses
of consistent subjective idealism, just as (si licet parva
componere magnis !—if it is permissible to compare
the great with the small) Hegel’s “Absolute
Idea” gathered together all the contradictions of
Kantian idealism and all the weaknesses of
Fichteanism. Feuerbach had to make only one serious
step in order to return to materialism, namely, universally to
discard, absolutely to eliminate, the Absolute Idea, that
Hegelian “substitution of the psychical” for
physical nature. Feuerbach cut off the Chinese pigtail of
philosophical idealism, in other words, he took nature as the
basis without any “substitution” whatever.       

We must wait and see whether the Chinese pigtail of Machian
idealism will go on growing for much longer.

Lenin: 1908/mec: 6. The 'Theory of Symbols' (or Hieroglyphs) and the Criticism of Helmholtz







V.I. Lenin
MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Four: The Philosophical Idealists as Comrades-In-Arms and Successors of Empirio-Criticism )
6. The “Theory of Symbols” (or
      Hieroglyphs) and the Criticism of Helmholtz

As a supplement to what has been said above of the idealists
as the comrades-in-arms and successors of empirio-criticism,
it will be appropriate to dwell on the character of the
Machian criticism of certain philosophical propositions
touched upon in our literature. For instance, our Machian
would-be Marxists fastened with glee on Plekhanov’s
“hieroglyphs,” that is, on the theory that
man’s sensations and ideas are not copies of real things
and processes of nature, not their images, but conventional
signs, symbols, hieroglyphs, and so
on.[4] Bazarov ridicules this
hieroglyphic materialism; and, it should be stated, he
would be right in doing so if he rejected hieroglyphic
materialism in favour of non-hieroglyphic
materialism. But Bazarov here again resorts to a
sleight-of-hand and palms off his renunciation of materialism
as a criticism of “hieroglyphism.” Engels speaks
neither of symbols nor of hieroglyphs, but of copies,
photographs, images, mirror-reflections of things. Instead of
pointing out the erroneousness of Plekhanov’s

    

deviation
from Engels’ formulation of materialism, Bazarov uses
Plekhanov’s error in order to conceal Engels’
truth from the reader.       

To make clear both Plekhanov’s error and Bazarov’s
confusion we shall refer to an important advocate of the
“theory of symbols” (calling a symbol a hieroglyph
changes nothing), Helmholtz, and shall see how he was
criticised by the materialists and by the idealists in
conjunction with the Machians.       

Helmholtz, a scientist of the first magnitude, was as
inconsistent in philosophy as are the great majority of
scientists. He tended towards Kantianism, but in his
epistemology he did not adhere even to these views
consistently. Here for instance are some passages on the
subject of the correspondance of ideas and objects from his
Handbook of Physiological
Optics:[1]

“I have
. . . designated sensations as merely symbols for the
relations of the external world and I have denied that they
have any similarity or equivalence to what they
represent” (French translation, p. 579; German original,
p. 442).  This is agnosticism,

      

but on the same further on we read: “Our concepts and ideas
      are effects wrought on our nervous system and our
      consciousness by the objects that are perceived and
      apprehended.”

      This is materialism. But Helmholtz is not clear as to the
      relation between absolute and relative truth, as is evident from
      his subsequent remarks. For instances, a little further on he
      says: “I therefore think that there can be no possible meaning
      in speaking of the truth of our ideas save as a
      practical truth. Our ideas of things cannot be
      anything but symbols, naturally given signs for things, which we
      learn to use in order to regulate our movements and
      actions. When we have learned to read these symbols rightly we
      are in a position with their aid to direct our actions so as to
      achieve the desired result...”

      This is not correct. Helmholtz here lapses into subjectivism,
      into a denial of objective reality and objective truth. And he
      arrives at a flagrant untruth when he concludes the paragraph
      with the words: “An idea and the object it represents obviously
      belong to two entirely different worlds....” Only the Kantians
      thus divorce idea from reality, consciousness

    

from
      nature. However, a little further on we read: “As to the
      properties of the objects of the external world, a little
      reflection will show that all the properties we may attribute to
      them merely signify the effects wrought by them either
      on our senses or on other natural objects” (French ed., p. 581;
      German original, p. 445; I translate from the French).

      

Here again Helmholtz reverts to the materialist
position. Helmholtz was an inconsistent Kantian, now
recognising a priori laws of thought, now tending
towards the “transcendental reality” of time and
space (i.e., to a materialist conception of them);
now deriving human sensations from external objects, which act
upon our sense organs, and now declaring sensations to be only
symbols, i.e.,certain arbitrary signs divorced from
the “entirely different” world of the things
signified (cf. Viktor Heyfelder, Ueber den
Begriff der Erfahrung bei Helmholtz [Helmholtz’s
Conception of Experience], Berlin 1897).       

This is how Helmholtz expressed his views in a speech
delivered in 1878 on “Facts in Perception” (“a
noteworthy pronouncement from the realistic camp,” as
Leclair characterised this speech): “Our sensations are
indeed effects wrought by external causes in our organs, and
the manner in which such effects manifest themselves, of
course, depends very essentially on the nature of the
apparatus on which these effects are wrought. Inasmuch as the
quality of our sensation informs us of the properties of the
external action by which this sensation is produced, the
latter can be regarded as its sign (Zeichen), but not
as its image. For a certain resemblance to the object
imaged is demanded of an image. . . . But a sign need not
resemble that of which it is a sign. . .”
(Vorträge und Reden [Lectures and Speeches],
1884, Bd. II, S. 226). If sensations are not images of things,
but only signs or symbols which do “not resemble”
them, then Helmholtz’s initial materialist premise is
undermined; the existence of external objects becomes subject
to doubt; for signs or symbols may quite possibly indicate
imaginary objects, and everybody is familiar with instances of
such signs or symbols. Helmholtz, following Kant,
attempts to draw something like an absolute boundary between
the “phenomenon” and the “thing-in
itself.” Helmholtz harbours an insuperable prejudice
against straightforward, clear, and open materialism. But a
little further on he says: “I do not see how one could
refute

    

a system even of the most extreme subjective idealism
that chose to regard life as a dream. One might declare it to
be highly improbable and unsatisfactory—I myself would
in this case subscribe to the severest expressions of
dissent—yet it could be constructed
consistently. . . . The realistic hypothesis, on the contrary,
trusts the evidence (Aussage) of ordinary
self-observation, according to which the changes of perception
that follow a certain action have no psychical connection with
the preceding impulse of volition. This hypothesis regards
everything that seems to be substantiated by our everyday
perception, viz., the material world outside of us,
as existing independently of our ideas.” (pp. 242-43.)
“Undoubtedly, the realistic hypothesis is the simplest
we can construct; it has been tested and verified in an
extremely broad field of application; it is sharply defined in
its several parts and, therefore, it is in the highest degree
useful and fruitful as a basis of action”
(p. 243). Helmholtz’s agnosticism also resembles
“shamefaced materialism,” with certain Kantian
twists, in distinction to Huxley’s Berkeleian twists.       

Albrecht Rau, a follower of Feuerbach, therefore vigorously
criticises Helmholtz’s theory of symbols as an
inconsistent deviation from “realism.”
Helmholtz’s basic view, says Rau, is a realistic
hypothesis, according to which “we apprehend the
objective properties of things with the help of our
senses”.[2]

The
theory of symbols cannot be reconciled with such a view
(which, as we have seen, is wholly materialist), for it
implies a certain distrust of perception, a distrust of the
evidence of our sense-organs. It is beyond doubt that an image
cannot wholly resemble the model, but an image is one thing, a
symbol, a conventional sign, another. The image
inevitably and of necessity implies the objective reality of
that which it “images.” “Conventional
sign,” symbol, hieroglyph are concepts which introduce
an entirely unnecessary element of agnosticism. Albrecht Rau,
therefore, is perfectly right in saying that Helmholtz’s
theory of symbols pays tribute to Kantianism. “Had
Helmholtz,” says Rau, “remained true to his
realistic conception, had he consistently adhered to the basic
principle that the

    

properties of bodies express the relations
of bodies to each other and also to us, he obviously would
have had no need of the whole theory of symbols; he could then
have said, briefly and clearly: the sensations which are
produced in us by things are reflections of the nature of
those things” (ibid., p. 320).       

That is the way a materialist criticises Helmholtz. He rejects
Helmholtz’s hieroglyphic or symbolic materialism or
semi-materialism in favour of Feuerbach’s consistent
materialism.       

The idealist Leclair (a representative of the
“immanentist school,” so dear to Mach’s
heart and mind) also accuses Helmholtz of inconsistency, of
wavering between materialism and spiritualism. (Der
Realismus, etc., S. 154.) But for Leclair the
theory of symbols is not insufficiently materialistic but too
materialistic. Leclair says: “Helmholtz thinks that the
perceptions of our consciousness offer sufficient support for
the cognition of sequence in time as well as of the identity
or non-identity of transcendental causes. This in
Helmholtz’s opinion is sufficient for the assumption and
cognition of law in the realm of the transcendental”
(i.e., in the realm of the objectively real)
(p. 33). And Leclair thunders against this “dogmatic
prejudice of Helmholtz’s”: “Berkeley’s
God,” he exclaims, “as the hypothetical cause of
the conformity to natural law of the ideas in our
mind is at least just as capable of satisfying our need of
causality as a world of external objects”
(p. 31). “A consistent application of the theory of
symbols. . . can achieve nothing without a generous admixture
of vulgar realism” (i.e., materialism)
(p. 35).       

This is how a “critical idealist” criticised
Helmholtz for his materialism in 1879. Twenty years later, in
his article “The Fundamental Views of Ernst Mach and
Heinrich Hertz on
Physics,”[3]

Kleinpeter, the
disciple of Mach so highly praised by his teacher, refuted in
the following way the “antiquated” Helmholtz with
the aid of Mach’s “recent” philosophy. Let
us for the moment leave aside Hertz (who, in fact, was as
inconsistent as Helmholtz) and examine Kleinpeter’s

    

comparison of Mach and Helmholtz. Having quoted a number of
passages from the works of both writers, and having
particularly stressed Mach’s well-known statements to
the effect that bodies are mental symbols for complexes of
sensations and so on, Kleinpeter says:       

“If we follow Helmholtz’s line of thought, we
shall encounter the following fundamental premises:       

“1) There exist objects of the external world.       

“2) A change in these objects is inconceivable without
the action of some cause (which is thought of as real).       

“3) ‘Cause, according to the original meaning of
the word, is the unchangeable residue or being behind the
changing phenomena, namely, substance and the law of its
action, force.’ [The quotation is taken by Kleinpeter
from Helmholtz.]       

“4)It is possible to deduce all phenomena from their
causes in a logically strict and uniquely determined manner.       

“5)The achievement of this end is equivalent to the
possession of objective truth, the acquisition
(Erlangung) of which is thus regarded as
conceivable” (p. 163).       

Rendered indignant by these premises, by their
contradictoriness and their creation of insoluble problems,
Kleinpeter remarks that Helmholtz does not hold strictly to
these views and sometimes employs “turns of speech which
are somewhat suggestive of Mach’s purely logical
understanding of such words” as matter, force,
causality, etc.       

“It is not difficult to find the source of our
dissatisfaction with Helmholtz, if we recall Mach’s
fine, clear words. The false understanding of the words mass,
force, etc., is the basic weakness of Helmholtz’s whole
argument. These are only concepts, products of our imagination
and not realities existing outside of thought. We are not even
in a position to know such things. From the observation of our
senses we are in general unable, owing to their imperfection,
to make even a single uniquely determined conclusion. We can
never assert, for instance, that upon reading a certain scale
(durch Ablesen einer Skala) we shall obtain a
definite figure: there are always, within certain limits, an
infinite number of possible figures all equally compatible
with the facts of the observation. And to have knowledge of
something real lying outside us—that is for us
impossible. Let us assume, however, that it were possible, and
that we did get to know

    

reality; in that case we would have no
right to apply the laws of logic to it, for they are
our laws, applicable only to our conceptions, to
our mental products [Kleinpeter’s
italics]. Between facts there is no logical connection, but
only a simple succession; apodictic assertions are here
unthinkable. It is therefore incorrect to say that one fact is
the cause of another and, consequently, the whole deduction
built up by Helmholtz on this conception falls to the
ground. Finally, the attainment of objective truth,
i.e.,truth existing independently of any subject, is
impossible, not only because of the nature of our senses, but
also because as men (als Menschen) we can in general
have no notion of what exists quite independently of us
(p. 164).       

As the reader sees, our disciple of Mach, repeating the
favourite phrases of his teacher and of Bogdanov, who does not
own himself a Machian, rejects Helmholtz’s whole
philosophy, rejects it from the idealist standpoint. The
theory of symbols is not even especially singled out by the
idealist, who regards it as an unimportant and perhaps
accidental deviation from materialism. And Helmholtz is chosen
by Kleinpeter as a representative of the “traditional
views in physics,” “views shared to this day by
the majority of phys icists” (p. 160).       

The result we have arrived at is that Plekhanov was guilty of
an obvious mistake in his exposition of materialism, but that
Bazarov completely muddled the matter, mixed up materialism
with idealism and advanced in opposition to the “theory
of symbols,” or “hieroglyphic materialism,”
the idealist nonsense that “sense-perception is the
reality existing out side us.” From the Kantian
Helmholtz, just as from Kant himself, the materialists went to
the Left, the Machians to the Right.

In Geneva in 1892 appeared the first Russian edition of
Engels’ work Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of
Classical German Philosophy, translated by
G. V. Plokhanov and with a foreword and notes by
him. Commenting on Engels’ formulation of the
fundamental question of philosophy and characterisation of
agnosticism, Plekhanov gave a critical exposition of the
theory of knowledge of a number of trends of idealist
philosophy (Hume, Kant, the neo-Kantians, etc.) and
counterposed to them the materialist theory of knowledge, in
doing so he committed an error by saying:
      

“Our sensations are in their way hieroglyphs which
inform us of what is taking place in reality. The hieroglyphs
do not resemble the events convoyed by them. But they can
with complete fidelity convey both the events
themselves, and—what is the main thing—the
relations existing between them” (G. V. Plekhanov,
Selected Philosophical Works, Vol. 1, Moscow,
p. 536). In 1905, in the notes to the second edition of
Engels’ work, Plekhanov admitted:  “I also failed
to express myself quite exactly” (ibid.,
p. 545). Plekhanov’s error, although appearing to be a
question of terminology, was a concession to agnosticism and
bore witness to his insufficiently profound understanding of
the dialectics of the process of cognition.

Lenin: 1908/mec: 7. Two Kinds of Criticism of Dühring







V.I. Lenin
MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Four: The Philosophical Idealists as Comrades-In-Arms and Successors of Empirio-Criticism )
7. Two Kinds of Criticism of
Dühring

Let us note another characteristic feature in the
Machians’ incredible perversion of
materialism. Valentinov endeavours to beat the Marxists by
comparing them to Büchner, who supposedly has much in
common with Plekhanov, although Engels sharply dissociated
himself from Buchner. Bogdanov, approaching the same question
from another angle,

    

defends, as it were, the
“materialism of the natural scientists,” which, he
says, “is usually spoken of with a certain
contempt” (Empirio-Monism, Bk. III, p. x). Both
Valentinov and Bogdanov are wretchedly muddled on this
question. Marx and Engels always “spoke
contemptuously” of bad socialists; but from this it
follows that they demanded the teaching of correct socialism,
scientific socialism, and not a flight from socialism to
bourgeois views. Marx and Engels always condemned bad
(and, particularly, anti-dialectical) materialism; but they
condemned it from the standpoint of a higher, more advanced
dialectical materialism, and not from the standpoint
of Humism or Berkeleianism. Marx, Engels and Dietzgen would
discuss the bad materialists, reason with them and seek to
correct their errors. But they would not even discuss the
Humeans and Berkeleians, Mach and Avenarius, confining
themselves to a single still more contemptuous remark about
their trend as a whole. Therefore, the endless faces
and grimaces made by our Machians over Holbach and Co.,
Büchner and Co., etc., are absolutely nothing but an
attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the public, a cover for
the departure of Machism as a whole from the very foundations
of materialism in general, and a fear to take up a
straightforward and clear position with regard to Engels.       

And it would be hard to express oneself more clearly on the
French materialism of the eighteenth century and on
Büchner, Vogt and Moleschott, than Engels does at the end
of Chapter II of his Ludwig Feuerbach. It is
impossible not to understand Engels, unless one deliberately
wishes to distort him. Marx and I are materialists—says
Engels in this chapter, explaining what fundamentally
distinguishes all schools of materialism from the whole
camp of the idealists, from all the Kantians and Humeans
in general. And Engels reproaches Feuerbach for a certain
pusillanimity, a certain frivolity of thought, as
expressed in his rejection at times of materialism in general
because of the mistakes of one or another school of
materialists. Feuerbach “should not have confounded the
doctrines of these hedge-preachers [Büchner and Co.] with
materialism in
general,”[2] says Engels
(p. 21). Only minds that are spoilt by reading and credulously
accepting the doctrines of the German reactionary professors

    

could have misunderstood the nature of such
reproaches levelled by Engels at Feuerbach.       

Engels says very clearly that Büchner and Co. “by
no means overcame the limitations of their teachers,”
i.e.,the materialists of the eighteenth century, that
they had not made a single step forward. And it is
for this, and this alone, that Engels took
Büchner and Co. to task; not for their materialism, as
the ignoramuses think, but because they did not
advance materialism, because “it was quite
outside their scope to develop the theory [of
materialism] any further.” It was for this
alone that Engels took Büchner and Co. to task. And
thereupon point by point Engels enumerates three fundamental
“limitations” (Beschränktheit) of
the French materialists of the eighteenth century, from which
Marx and Engels had emancipated themselves, but from which
Büchner and Co. were unable to emancipate themselves. The
first limitation was that the views of the old materialists
were “mechanical,” in the sense that they
believed in “the exclusive application of the standards
of mechanics to processes of a chemical and organic
nature” (p. 19). We shall see in the next chapter that
failure to understand these words of Engels’ caused
certain people to succumb to idealism through the new
physics. Engels does not reject mechanical
materialism for the faults attributed to it by physicists of
the “recent” idealist (alias Machian) trend. The
second limitation was the metaphysical character of the views
of the old materialists, meaning the
“anti-dialectical character of their
philosophy.” This limitation is fully shared with
Büchner and Co. by our Machians, who, as we have seen,
entirely failed to understand Engels’ application of
dialectics to epistemology (for example, absolute and relative
truth). The third limitation was the preservation of idealism
“up above,” in the realm of the social sciences, a
non-understanding of historical materialism.       

Having enumerated these three “limitations” and
explained them with exhaustive clarity (pp. 19-21), Engels
then and there adds that they (Büchner and Co.)
did not emerge “from these limits”
(über diese Schranken).       

Exclusively for these three things and exclusively
within these limits, does Engels refute both the materialism
of the eighteenth century and the doctrines of Büchner
and Co.!

    

On all other, more elementary, questions of
materialism (questions distorted by the Machians) there is
and can be no difference between Marx and Engels on the
one hand and all these old materialists on the other. It was
only the Russian Machians who brought confusion into this
perfectly clear question, since for their West-European
teachers and co-thinkers the radical difference between the
line of Mach and his friends and the line of the materialists
generally is perfectly obvious. Our Machians found it
necessary to confuse the issue in order to represent their
break with Marxism and their desertion to the camp of
bourgeois philosophy as “minor corrections” of
Marxism!       

Take Dühring. It is hard to imagine anything more
contemptuous than the opinion of him expressed by Engels. But
at the same time that Dühring was criticised by
Engels, just see how he was criticised by
Leclair, who praises Mach’s “revolutionising
philosophy.” Leclair regards Dühring as the
“extreme Left” of materialism, which
“without any evasion declares sensation, as well as
every activity of consciousness and intelligence in general,
to be the secretion, function, supreme flower, aggregate
effect, etc., of the animal organism” (Der
Realismus, etc., 1879, S. 23-24).       

Is it for this that Engels criticised Dühring? No. In
this he was in full agreement with Dühring, as
he was with every other materialist. He criticised
Dühring from the diametrically opposite standpoint,
namely, for the inconsistency of his materialism, for his
idealist fancies, which left a loophole for fideism.       

“Nature itself works both within ideating beings and
from without, in order to create the required knowledge of the
course of things by systematically producing coherent
views.” Leclair quotes these words of
Dühring’s and savagely attacks the materialism of
such a point of view, the “crude metaphysics” of
this materialism, the “self-deception,” etc.,
etc. (pp. 160 and 161-63).       

Is it for this that Engels criticised Dühring? No. He
ridiculed all florid language, but as regards the cognition of
objective law in nature, reflected by the consciousness,
Engels was fully in agreement with Dühring, as
he was with every other materialist.       
 

“Thought is a form of reality higher than the
rest. . . . A fundamental premise is the independence and
distinction of the materially real world from the groups of
manifestations of the consciousness.” Leclair quotes
these words of Dühring’s together with a number of
Dühring’s attacks on Kant, etc., and for this
accuses Dühring of “metaphysics”
(pp. 218-22), of subscribing to “a metaphysical
dogma,” etc.       

Is it for this that Engels criticised Dühring? No. That
the world exists independently of the mind and that every
deviation from this truth on the part of the Kantians,
Humeans, Berkeleians, and so forth, is false, on this point
Engels was fully in agreement with Dühring, as he was
with every other materialist. Had Engels seen from what
angle Leclair, in the spirit of Mach, criticised
Dühring, he would have called both these philosophical
reactionaries names a hundred times more contemptuous
than those he called Dühring. To Leclair Dühring was
the incarnation of pernicious realism and materialism
(cf. also Beiträge zu einer monistischen
Erkenntnistheorie, 1882, S. 45). In 1878, W. Schuppe,
teacher and comrade-in-arms of Mach, accused Dühring of
“visionary realism”
(Traumrealismus)[1]

in revenge for the epithet
“visionary idealism” which Dühring had hurled
against all idealists. For Engels, on the contrary,
Dühring was not a sufficiently steadfast, clear
and consistent materialist.       

Marx and Engels, as well as J. Dietzgen, entered the
philosophical arena at a time when materialism reigned among
the advanced intellectuals in general, and in working-class
circles in particular. It is therefore quite natural that they
should have devoted their attention not to a repetition of old
ideas but to a serious theoretical development of
materialism, its application to history, in other words, to
the completion of the edifice of materialist
philosophy up to its summit. It is quite natural that
in the sphere of epistemology they confined
themselves to correcting Feuerbach’s errors, to
ridiculing the banalities of the materialist Dühring, to
criticising the errors of Büchner (see J. Dietzgen), to
emphasising what these most widely known and popular writers

    

among the workers particularly lacked, namely,
dialectics. Marx, Engels and J. Dietzgen did not worry about
the elementary truths of materialism, which had been cried by
the hucksters in dozens of books, but devoted all their
attention to ensuring that these elementary truths should not
be vulgarised, should not be over-simplified, should not lead
to stagnation of thought (“materialism below, idealism
above”), to forgetfulness of the valuable fruit of
the idealist systems, Hegelian dialectics—that pearl
which those farmyard cocks, the Büchners, the
Dührings and Co. (as well as Leclair, Mach, Avenarius and
so forth), could not pick out from the dungheap of absolute
idealism.       

If one envisages at all concretely the historical conditions
in which the philosophical works of Engels and J. Dietzgen
were written, it will be perfectly clear why they were
more concerned to dissociate themselves from the
vulgarisation of the elementary truths of materialism than to
defend the truths themselves. Marx and Engels were
similarly more concerned to dissociate themselves from the
vulgarisation of the fundamental demands of political
democracy than to defend these demands.       

Only disciples of the philosophical reactionaries could have
“failed to notice” this circumstance, and could
have presented the case to their readers in such a way as to
make it appear that Marx and Engels did not know what being a
materialist means.

V.I. Lenin
MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Four: The Philosophical Idealists as Comrades-In-Arms and Successors of Empirio-Criticism )
8. How Could J. Dietzgen Have Found Favour
with the Reactionary Philosophers?

The previously cited example of Helfond already contains the
answer to this question, and we shall not examine the
innumerable instances in which J. Dietzgen receives Helfond
like treatment at the hands of our Machians. It is more
expedient to quote a number of passages from J. Dietzgen
himself in order to bring out his weak
points.[1] 

“Thought is a function of the brain,” says
Dietzgen (Das Wesen der menschlichen Kopfarbeit,
1903, S. 52; there is a Russian translation). “Thought
is a product of the brain. . . . My desk, as the content of my
thought, is identical with that thought, does not differ from
it. But my desk outside

    

of my head is a separate object quite
distinct from it” (p. 53). These perfectly clear
materialistic propositions are, however, supplemented by
Dietzgen thus: “Nevertheless, the non-sensible idea is
also sensible, material, i.e.,real. . . . The mind
differs no more from the table, light, or sound than these
things differ from each other” (p. 54). This is
obviously false. That both thought and matter are
“real,” i.e.,exist, is true. But to say
that thought is material is to make a false step, a step
towards confusing materialism and idealism. As a matter of
fact this is only an inexact expression of Dietzgen’s,
who elsewhere correctly says: “Mind and matter at least
have this in common, that they exist”
(p. 80). “Thinking,” says Dietzgen, “is a
work of the body. . . . In order to think I require a
substance that can be thought of. This substance is provided
in the phenomena of nature and life. . . . Matter is the
boundary of the mind, beyond which the latter cannot
pass. . . . Mind is a product of matter, but matter is more
than a product of mind. . .” (p. 64). The Machians
refrain from analysing materialist arguments of the
materialist Dietzgen such as these! They prefer to fasten on
passages where he is inexact and muddled. For example, he says
that scientists can be “idealists only outside their
field” (p. 108). Whether this is so, and why it is so,
on this the Machians are silent. But a page or so earlier
Dietzgen recognises the “positive side of modern
idealism” (p. 106) and the “inadequacy of the
materialist principle,” which should rejoice the
Machians. The incorrectly expressed thought of
Dietzgen’s consists in the fact that the difference
between matter and mind is also relative and not
excessive (p. 107). This is true, but what follows from
this is not that materialism as such is inadequate, but that
metaphysical, anti-dialectical materialism is inadequate.       

“Simple, scientific truth is not based on a person. It
has its foundation outside [i.e., of the person], in
its material; it is objective truth. . . . We call ourselves
materialists. . . . Philosophical materialists are
distinguished by the fact that they put the corporeal world at
the beginning, at the head, and put the idea, or spirit, as
the sequel, whereas their opponents, after the manner of
religion, derive things from the word. . . the material world
from the idea” (Kleinere philosophische
Schriften, 1903, S. 59, 62). The Machians avoid this
recognition of objective truth and repetition of
Engels’
    

definition of materialism. But Dietzgen
goes on to say: “We would be equally right in calling
ourselves idealists, for our system is based on the total
result of philosophy, on the scientific investigation of the
idea, on a clear insight into the nature of mind”
(p. 63). It is not difficult to seize upon this obviously
incorrect phrase in order to deny materialism. Actually,
Dietzgen’s formulation is more inexact than his basic
thought, which amounts to this, that the old materialism was
unable to investigate ideas scientifically (with the aid of
historical materialism).       

Here are Dietzgen’s ideas on the old
materialism. “Like our understanding of political
economy, our materialism is a scientific, historical
conquest. Just as definitely as we distinguish ourselves from
the socialists of the past, so we distinguish ourselves from
the old materialists. With the latter we have only this in
common, that we acknowledge matter to be the premise, or prime
base of the idea” (p. 140). This word “only”
is significant! It contains the whole epistemological
foundation of materialism, as distinguished from
agnosticism, Machism, idealism. But Dietzgen’s attention
is here concentrated on dissociating himself from vulgar
materialism.       

But then follows a little further on a passage that is quite
incorrect: “The concept matter must be broadened. It
embraces all the phenomena of reality, as well as our faculty
of knowing or explaining” (p. 141). This is a muddle
which can only lead to confusing materialism and idealism
under the guise of “broadening” the former. To
seize upon this “broadening” would be to forget
the basis of Dietzgen’s philosophy, the
recognition of matter as the primary, “the boundary of
the mind.” But, as a matter of fact, a few lines further
down Dietzgen corrects himself: “The whole governs the
part, matter the mind. . . . In this sense we may love and
honour the material world . . . as the first cause, as the
creator of heaven and earth” (p. 142). That the
conception of “matter” must also include thoughts,
as Dietzgen repeats in the Excursions  (op. cit.,
p. 214), is a muddle, for if such an inclusion is made, the
epistemological contrast between mind and matter, idealism and
materialism, a contrast upon which Dietzgen himself insists,
loses all meaning. That this contrast must not be made
“excessive,” exaggerated, metaphysical,

    

is beyond
dispute (and it is to the great credit of the
dialectical materialist Dietzgen that he emphasised
this). The limits of the absolute necessity and absolute truth
of this relative contrast are precisely those limits which
define the trend of epistemological
investigations. To operate beyond these limits with the
distinction between matter and mind, physical and mental, as
though they were absolute opposites, would be a great
mistake.       

Dietzgen, unlike Engels, expresses his thoughts in a vague,
unclear, mushy way. But apart from his defects of exposition
and his individual mistakes, he not unsuccessfully champions
the “materialist theory of knowledge”
(pp. 222 and 271), “dialectical materialism”
(p. 224). “The materialist theory of knowledge
then,” says Dietzgen, “amounts to the recognition
that the human organ of perception radiates no metaphysical
light, but is a piece of nature which reflects other pieces of
nature” (pp. 222-23). “Our perceptive faculty is
not a supernatural source of truth, but a mirror-like
instrument, which reflects the things of the world, or
nature” (p. 243). Our profound Machians avoid an
analysis of each individual proposition of Dietzgen’s
materialist theory of knowledge, but seize upon his
deviations from that theory, upon his vagueness and
confusion. J. Dietzgen could find favour with the reactionary
philosophers only because he occasionally gets muddled. And,
it goes without saying, where there is a muddle there you will
find Machians.       

Marx wrote to Kugelmann on December 5, 1868: “A fairly
long time ago he [Dietzgen] sent me a fragment of a manuscript
on the ‘faculty of thought’ which in spite of a
certain confusion and of too frequent repetition, contains
much that is excellent and—as the independent product of
a working man—admirable” (Russian translation.,
p. 53).[2] Mr. Valentinov quotes this opinion,
but it never dawned on him to ask what Marx regarded
as Dietzgen’s confusion, whether it was that
which brings Dietzgen close to Mach, or that which
distinguishes Dietzgen from Mach. Mr. Valentinov does not ask
this question because he read both Dietzgen and Marx’s
letters after the manner of Gogol’s Petrushka. Yet it is
not difficult to find the answer to this question. Marx
frequently called his world outlook dialectical materialism,
and Engels’ Anti-Dühring, the whole of
which Marx read through in
    

manuscript, expounds precisely
this world outlook. Hence, it should have been clear even to
the Valentinovs that Dietzgen’s confusion could
lie only in his deviation from a consistent
application of dialectics, from consistent
materialism, in particular from
Anti-Dühring.       

Does it now dawn upon Mr. Valentinov and his brethren that
what Marx could call Dietzgen’s confusion is only
what brings Dietzgen close to Mach, who went from Kant
not towards materialism, but towards Berkeley and Hume? Or was
it that the materialist Marx called Dietzgen’s
materialist theory of knowledge confused, yet approved his
deviations from materialism, that is, approved what differs
from Anti-Dühring, which was written with his
(Marx’s) participation?       

Whom are they trying to fool, our Machians, who desire to be
regarded as Marxists and at the same time inform the world
that “their” Mach approved of Dietzgen?
Have our heroes failed to guess that Mach could approve in
Dietzgen only that which Marx called confusion?       

But taken as a whole, J. Dietzgen does not deserve so severe a
censure. He is nine-tenths a materialist and never made any
claims either to originality or to possessing a special
philosophy distinct from materialism. He spoke of Marx
frequently, and invariably as the head of the trend
(Kleinere philosophische Schriften, S. 4—an opinion
uttered in 1873; on page 95—1876—he emphasises
that Marx and Engels “possessed the necessary
philosophical training”; on page 181—1886—he
speaks of Marx and Engels as the “acknowledged
founders” of the trend). Dietzgen was a Marxist, and
Eugene Dietzgen, and—alasl—Comrade P. Dauge are
rendering him left-handed service by their invention of
“Naturmonismus,” “Dietzgenism,”
etc. “Dietzgenism” as distinct from dialectical
materialism is confusion, a step towards
reactionary philosophy, an attempt to create a trend not from
what is great in Joseph Dietzgen (and in that
worker-philosopher, who discovered dialectical materialism in
his own way, there is much that is great!) but from his
weak points.       

I shall confine myself to two examples in order to illustrate
how Comrade P. Dauge and Eugene Dietzgen are sliding into
reactionary philosophy.       
 

In the second edition of the
Akquisit[3]
(p. 273), Dauge writes: “Even bourgeois criticism points
out the connection between Dietzgen’s philosophy and
empirio-criticism and also the immanentist school,” and,
further on, “especially Leclair” (a quotation from
a “bourgeois criticism”).       

That P. Dauge values and esteems J. Dietzgen cannot be
doubted. But it also cannot be doubted that he is
defaming him by citing without protest the
opinion of a bourgeois scribbler who classes the sworn enemy
of fideism and of the professors—the “graduated
flunkeys” of the bourgeoisie—with the outspoken
preacher of fideism and avowed reactionary, Leclair. It is
possible that Dauge repeated another’s opinion of the
immanentists and of Leclair without himself being familiar
with the writings of these reactionaries. But let this serve
him as a warning: the road away from Marx to the
peculiarities of Dietzgen—to Mach—to the
immanentists—is a road leading into a morass. To class
him not only with Leclair but even with Mach is to lay stress
on Dietzgen the muddlehead as distinct from Dietzgen the
materialist.       

I shall defend Dietzgen against Dauge. I assert that Dietzgen
did not deserve the shame of being classed with Leclair. And I
can cite a witness, a most authoritative one on such a
question, one who is as much a reactionary, as much a fideist
and “immanentist” philosopher as Leclair himself,
namely, Schubert-Soldern. In 1896 he wrote: “The
Social-Democrats willingly lean for support on Hegel with more
or less (usually less) justification, but they materialise the
Hegelian philosophy; cf. J. Dietzgen. . . . With
Dietzgen, the absolute becomes the universal, and this becomes
the thing-in-itself, the absolute subject, whose appearances
are its predicates. That he [Dietzgen] is thus converting a
pure abstraction into the basis of the concrete process, he
does not, of course, realise any more than Hegel himself
did. . . . He frequently chaotically lumps together Hegel,
Darwin, Haeckel, and natural-scientific materialism”
(Die soziale Frage, S. xxxiii). Schubert-Soldern is a
keener judge of philosophical shades than Mach, who praises
everybody indiscriminately, including the Kantian Jerusalem.       

Eugene Dietzgen was so simple-minded as to complain to the
German public that in Russia the narrow materialists

    

had
“insulted” Joseph Dietzgen, and he translated
Plekhanov’s and Dauge’s articles on Joseph
Dietzgen into German. (See Joseph Dietzgen, Erkenntnis und
Wahrheit [Knowledge and Truth], Stuttgart, 1908,
Appendix). The poor “Natur-monist’s”
complaint rebounded on his own head. Franz Mehring, who may be
regarded as knowing something of philosophy and Marxism, wrote
in his review that Plekhanov was essentially right as against
Dauge (Die Neue Zeit, 1908, No. 38, 19. Juni,
Feuilleton, S. 432). That J. Dietzgen got into
difficulties when he deviated from Marx and
Engels (p. 431) is for Mehring beyond question. Eugene
Dietzgen replied to Mehring in a long, snivelling note, in
which he went so far as to say that J. Dietzgen might be of
service “in reconciling” the “warring
brothers, the orthodox and the revisionists” (Die
Neue Zeit, 1908, No. 44, 31. Juli, S. 652).       

Another warning, Comrade Dauge: the road away from Marx to
“Dietzgenism” and “Machism” is a
road into the morass, not for individuals, not for
Tom, Dick and Harry, but for the trend.       

And do not complain, Messrs. Machians, that I quote the
“authorities”; your objections to the authorities are
but a screen for the fact that for the socialist authorities
(Marx, Engels, Lafargue, Mehring, Kautsky) you are
substituting bourgeois authorities (Mach, Petzoldt,
Avenarius and the immanentists). You would do better not to
raise the question of “authorities” and
“authoritarianism”!
      

    

     
Notes
 
 



[1]
The Institute of Marxism-Leninism has in its archives a copy
of Joseph Dietzgen’s book Kietnere philosophische
Sebriften. Eine Aoswohl (Minor Philosophical Writings. A
Selection), Stuttgart, Dietz, 1903, with annotations by
Lenin. The book includes seven articles published in 1870-78
in the newspapers Volksstaat (People’s State)
and Vorwarts (Forward) as well as a work entitled
Strcifzuge eines Solzialisten in das Gebiet der
Erkenntnistheorie (Excursions of a Socialist in the Field of
the Theory of Knowledge), which was published in 1887 as
a separate pamphlet.
      

Most of Lenin’s annotations were made while he was
working on the book Materialism and
Empirio-criticism. They consist of under linings and
remarks in the text and on the margins; in several cases Lenin
marks correct ideas of Dietzgen’s with the letter
“a” and departures from dialectical materialism with
the letter  “B”. Lenin’s annotations bring into
prominence Dietzgen’s description of the partisan
character of philosophy, the relations between philosophy and
natural science, the subject-matter of philosophy, the
fundamental philosophical categories, the problem of the
cognisability of the world, the appraisal of Kant, Hegel and
Feuerbach, the attitude to Marx and Engels, and
Dietzgen’s militant atheism. At the same time Lenin
notes Dietzgen’s confusion in regard to philosophical
categories, his attempt to  “widen” the concept of
matter by including in it  “all the phenomena of
reality, hence also our cognitive ability”, etc.

Chapter Five:

The Recent Revolution in Natural Science and Philosophical Idealism

A year ago, in Die
    Neue Zeit (1906–07, No. 52), there appeared an article by
    Joseph Diner-Dénes entitled “Marxism and the Recent
    Revolution in the Natural Sciences.” The defect of this
    article is that it ignores the epistemological conclusions which
    are being drawn from the “new” physics and in which we
    are especially interested at present. But it is precisely this
    defect which renders the point of view and the conclusions of the
    author particularly interesting for us. Joseph Diner-Dénes,
    like the present writer, holds the view of the
    “rank-and-file Marxist,” of whom our Machians speak
    with such haughty contempt. For instance, Mr. Yushkevich writes
    that “ordinarily, the average rank-and-file Marxist calls
    himself a dialectical materialist” (p. 1 of his book). And
    now this rank-and-file Marxist, in the person of
    J. Diner-Dénes, has directly compared the recent
    discoveries in science, and especially in physics (X-rays,
    Becquerel rays, radium,
etc.[1]), with Engels’
    Anti-Dühring. To what conclusion has this comparison
    led him? “In the most varied fields of natural
    science,” writes Diner-Dénes, “new knowledge has
    been acquired, all of which tends towards that single point which
    Engels desired to make clear, namely, that in nature ‘there
    are no irreconcilable contradictions, no forcibly fixed boundary
    lines and distinctions,’ and that if contradictions and
    distinctions are met with in nature, it is because we alone have
    introduced their rigidity and absoluteness into nature.” It
    was discovered, for instance, that light and electricity

    

are only
    manifestations of one and the same force of
nature.[2] Each day it
    becomes more probable that chemical affinity may be reduced to
    electrical processes. The indestructible and non-disintegrable
    elements of chemistry, whose number continues to grow as though in
    derision of the unity of the world, now prove to be destructible
    and disintegrable. The element radium has been converted into the
    element
helium.[3] “Just as all the forces of nature
    have been reduced to one force, so all substances in nature have
    been reduced to one substance”
    (Diner-Dénes’ italics). Quoting the opinion of one of
    the writers who regard the atom as only a condensation of the
    ether,[4]
    the author exclaims: “How brilliantly does this confirm the
    statement made by Engels thirty years ago that motion is the mode
    of existence of matter.” “All phenomena of nature are
    motion, and the differences between them lie only in the fact that
    we human beings perceive this motion in different forms. . . . It
    is as Engels said. Nature, like history, is subject to the
    dialectical law of motion.”
    

On the other hand, you cannot take up any of the writings of the
      Machians or about Machism without encountering pretentious
      references to the new physics, which is said to have refuted
      materialism, and so on and so forth. Whether these assertions
      are well-founded is another question, but the connection between
      the new physics, or rather a definite school of the new physics,
      and Machism and other varieties of modern idealist philosophy is
      beyond doubt. To analyse Machism and at the same time to ignore
      this connection—as Plekhanov
does[5]—is to scoff at the
      spirit of dialectical materialism, i.e., to sacrifice
      the method of Engels to the letter of Engels. Engels says
      explicitly that “with each epoch making discovery even in
      the sphere of natural science [“not to
      speak of the history of mankind”], materialism has to
      change its form” (Ludwig Feuerbach, Germ. ed.,
      p. 19).[6] Hence, a revision of the
      “form” of Engels’ materialism, a revision of
      his natural-philosophical propositions is not only not
      “revisionism,” in the accepted meaning of the term,
      but, on the contrary, is demanded by Marxism. We criticise the
      Machians not for making such a revision, but for their
      purely revisionist trick of betraying the
      essence of materialism under the guise of criticising
      its form and of adopting the fundamental precepts of
      reactionary

    

bourgeois philosophy without making the slightest
      attempt to deal directly, frankly and definitely with assertions
      of Engels’ which are unquestionably extremely important to
      the given question, as, for example, his assertion that
      “. . . motion without matter is unthinkable”
      (Anti-Dühring,
p. 50).[7]


It goes without saying that in examining the connection between
      one of the schools of modern physicists and the rebirth of
      philosophical idealism, it is far from being our intention to
      deal with specific physical theories. What interests us
      exclusively is the epistemological conclusions that follow from
      certain definite propositions and generally known
      discoveries. These epistemological conclusions are of themselves
      so insistent that many physicists are already reaching for
      them. What is more, there are already various trends among the
      physicists, and definite schools are beginning to be formed on
      this basis. Our object, therefore, will be confined to
      explaining clearly the essence of the difference between these
      various trends and the relation in which they stand to the
      fundamental lines of philosophy.
    

1. The Crisis in Modern Physics

In his book Valeur de la science [Value of Science],
      the famous French physicist Henri Poincaré says that there
      are “symptoms of a serious crisis” in physics, and
      he devotes a special chapter to this crisis (Chap. VIII,
      cf. p. 171). The crisis is not confined to the fact
      that “radium, the great revolutionary,” is
      undermining the principle of the conservation of
      energy. “All the other principles are equally
      endangered” (p. 180). For instance, Lavoisier’s
      principle, or the principle of the conservation of mass, has
      been undermined by the electron theory of matter. According to
      this theory atoms are composed of very minute particles called
      electrons, which are charged with positive or negative
      electricity and “are immersed in a medium which we call
      the ether.” The experiments of physicists provide data for
      calculating the velocity of the electrons and their mass (or the
      relation of their mass to their electrical charge). The velocity
      proves to be comparable

    

with the velocity of light (300,000
      kilometres per second), attaining, for instance, one-third of
      the latter. Under such circumstances the twofold mass of the
      electron has to be taken into account, corresponding to the
      necessity of over coming the inertia, firstly, of the electron
      itself and, secondly, of the ether. The former mass will be the
      real or mechanical mass of the electron, the latter the
      “electrodynamic mass which represents the inertia of the
      ether.” And it turns out that the former mass is equal to
      zero. The entire mass of the electrons, or, at least, of the
      negative electrons, proves to be totally and exclusively
      electrodynamic in its
origin.[8] Mass disappears. The foundations of
      mechanics are undermined. Newton’s principle, the equality
      of action and reaction, is undermined, and so on.
    

We are faced, says Poincaré, with the “ruins”
      of the old principles of physics, “a general debacle of
      principles.” It is true, he remarks, that all the
      mentioned departures from principles refer to infinitesimal
      magnitudes; it is possible that we are still ignorant of other
      infinitesimals counteracting the undermining of the old
      principles. Moreover, radium is very rare. But at any rate we
      have reached a “period of doubt.” We have
      already seen what epistemological deductions the author draws
      from this “period of doubt": “it is not nature which
      imposes on [or dictates to] us the concepts of space and time,
      but we who impose them on nature"; “whatever is not
      thought, is pure nothing.” These deductions are idealist
      deductions. The breakdown of the most fundamental principles
      shows (such is Poincaré’s trend of thought) that
      these principles are not copies, photographs of nature, not
      images of something external in relation to man’s
      consciousness, but products of his consciousness. Poincaré
      does not develop these deductions consistently, nor is he
      essentially interested in the philosophical aspect of the
      question. It is dealt with in detail by the French writer on
      philosophical problems, Abel Rey, in his book The Physical
      Theory of the Modern Physicists (La Théorie physique chez
      les physiciens contemporains, Paris, F. Alcan, 1907). True,
      the author himself is a positivist, i.e., a muddlehead
      and a semi-Machian, but in this case this is even a certain
      advantage, for he can not be suspected of a desire to
      “slander” our Machians’ idol. Rey cannot be

    

trusted when it comes to giving an exact philosophical
      definition of concepts and of materialism in particular, for
      Rey too is a professor, and as such is imbued with an utter
      contempt for the materialists (and distinguishes himself by
      utter ignorance of the epistemology of materialism). It goes
      without saying that a Marx or an Engels is absolutely
      non-existent for such “men of science.” But Rey
      summarises carefully and in general conscientiously the
      extremely abundant literature on the subject, not only French,
      but English and German as well (Ostwald and Mach in particular),
      so that we shall have frequent recourse to his work.
    

The attention of philosophers in general, says the author, and
      also of those who, for one reason or another, wish to criticise
      science generally, has now been particularly attracted towards
      physics. “In discussing the limits and value of physical
      knowledge, it is in effect the legitimacy of positive science,
      the possibility of knowing the object, that is criticised”
      (pp. i-ii). From the “crisis in modern physics”
      people hasten to draw sceptical conclusions (p. 14). Now, what
      is this crisis? During the first two-thirds of the nineteenth
      century the physicists agreed among themselves on everything
      essential. They believed in a purely mechanical explanation of
      nature: they assumed that physics is nothing but a more
      complicated mechanics, namely, a molecular mechanics. They
      differed only as to the methods used in reducing physics to
      mechanics and as to the details of the mechanism. . . . At
      present the spectacle presented by the physico-chemical sciences
      seems completely changed. Extreme disagreement has replaced
      general unanimity, and no longer does it concern details, but
      leading and fundamental ideas. While it would be an exaggeration
      to say that each scientist has his own peculiar tendencies, it
      must nevertheless be noted that science, and especially physics,
      has, like art, its numerous schools, the conclusions of which
      often differ from, and sometimes are directly opposed and
      hostile to each other. . . .
    

      “From this one may judge the significance and scope of
      what has been called the crisis in modern physics.
    

      “Down to the middle of the nineteenth century, traditional
      physics had assumed that it was sufficient merely to extend
      physics in order to arrive at a metaphysics of matter. This

    

physics ascribed to its theories an ontological value. And its
      theories were all mechanistic. The traditional mechanism [Rey employs
      this word in the specific sense of a
      system of ideas which reduces physics to mechanics] thus
      claimed, over and above the results of experience, a
      real knowledge of the material universe. This was not a
      hypothetical account of experience; it was a dogma. . .”
      (p. 16).
    

We must here interrupt the worthy “positivist.” It
      is clear that he is describing the materialist philosophy of
      traditional physics but does not want to call the devil
      (materialism) by name. Materialism to a Humean must appear to be
      metaphysics, dogma, a transgression of the bounds of experience,
      and so forth. Knowing nothing of materialism, the Humean Rey has
      no conception whatever of dialectics, of the difference between
      dialectical materialism and metaphysical materialism, in
      Engels’ meaning of the term. Hence, the relation between
      absolute and relative truth, for example, is absolutely unclear
      to Rey.
    

      “. . . The criticism of traditional mechanism made during
      the whole of the second half of the nineteenth century weakened
      the premise of the ontological reality of mechanism. On the
      basis of these criticisms a philosophical conception of physics
      was founded which became almost traditional in 7philosophy at
      the end of the nineteenth century. Science was nothing but a
      symbolic formula, a method of notation (repérage,
      the creation of signs, marks, symbols), and since the methods of
      notation varied according to the schools, the conclusion was
      soon reached that only that was denoted which had been
      previously designed (fa&ctailonné) by man for notation
      (or symbolisation). Science became a work of art for
      dilettantes, a work of art for utilitarians: views which could
      with legitimacy be generally interpreted as the negation of the
      possibility of science. A science which is a pure artifice for
      acting upon nature, a mere utilitarian technique, has no right
      to call itself science, without perverting the meaning of
      words. To say that science can be nothing but such an artificial
      means of action is to disavow science in the proper meaning of
      the term.
    

      “The collapse of traditional mechanism, or, more
      precisely, the criticism to which it was subjected, led to the
      proposition that science itself had also collapsed. From the

    

impossibility of adhering purely and simply to traditional
      mechanism it was inferred that science was impossible”
      (pp. 16-17).
    

And the author asks: “Is the present crisis in physics a
      temporary and external incident in the evolution of science, or
      is science itself making an abrupt right-about-face and
      definitely abandoning the path it has hitherto
      pursued?. . .”
    

      “If the [physical and chemical] sciences, which in history
      have been essentially emancipators, collapse in this crisis,
      which reduces them to the status of mere, technically useful
      recipes but deprives them of all significance from the stand
      point of knowledge of nature, the result must needs be a
      complete revolution both in the art of logic and the history of
      ideas. Physics then loses all educational value; the spirit of
      positive science it represents becomes false and
      dangerous.” Science can offer only practical recipes but
      no real knowledge. “Knowledge of the real must be sought
      and given by other means. . . . One must take another road, one
      must return to subjective intuition, to a mystical sense of
      reality, in a word, to the mysterious, all that of which one
      thought it had been deprived” (p. 19).
    

As a positivist, the author considers such a view wrong and the
      crisis in physics only temporary. We shall presently see how Rey
      purifies Mach, Poincaré and Co. of these conclusions. At
      present we shall confine ourselves to noting the fact of the
      “crisis” and its significance. From the last words
      of Rey quoted by us it is quite clear what reactionary elements
      have taken advantage of and aggravated this crisis. Rey
      explicitly states in the preface to his work that “the
      fideist and anti-intellectualist movement of the last years of
      the nineteenth century” is seeking “to base itself
      on the general spirit of modern physics” (p. ii). In
      France, those who put faith above reason are called fideists
      (from the Latin fides, faith). Anti-intellectualism is
      a doctrine that denies the rights or claims of reason. Hence, in
      its philosophical aspect, the essence of the “crisis in
      modern physics” is that the old physics regarded its
      theories as “real knowledge of the material world,”
      i.e., a reflection of objective reality. The new trend
      in physics regards theories only as symbols, signs, and marks
      for practice, i.e., it denies the existence of an
      objective reality independent of our mind and

    

reflected by
      it. If Rey had used correct philosophical terminology, he would
      have said: the materialist theory of knowledge, instinctively
      accepted by the earlier physics, has been replaced by an
      idealist and agnostic theory of knowledge, which, against the
      wishes of the idealists and agnostics, has been taken advantage
      of by fideism.
    

But Rey does not present this replacement, which constitutes the
      crisis, as though all the modern physicists stand opposed to all
      the old physicists. No. He shows that in their epistemological
      trends the modern physicists are divided into three schools: the
      energeticist or conceptualist school; the mechanistic or
      neo-mechanistic school, to which the vast majority of physicists
      still adhere; and in between the two, the critical school. To
      the first belong Mach and Duhem; to the third, Henri
      Poincaré to the second, Kirchhoff, Helmholtz, Thomson (Lord
      Kelvin), Maxwell—among the older physicists—and
      Larmor and Lorentz among the modern physicists. What the essence
      of the two basic trends is (for the third is not
      independent, but intermediate) may be judged from the following
      words of Rey’s:
    

      “Traditional mechanism constructed a system of the
      material world.” Its doctrine of the structure of matter
      was based on “elements qualitatively homogenous and
      identical"; and elements were to be regarded as
      “immutable, impenetrable,” etc. Physics
      “constructed a real edifice out of real
      materials and real cement. The physicist possessed
      material elements, the causes and modes of
      their action, and the real laws of their action”
      (pp. 33-38). “The change in this view consists in the
      rejection of the ontological significance of the theories and in
      an exaggerated emphasis on the phenomenological significance of
      physics.” The conceptualist view operates with “pure
      abstractions . . . and seeks a purely abstract theory which will
      as far as possible eliminate the hypothesis of matter. . . . The
      notion of energy thus becomes the substructure of the new
      physics. This is why conceptualist physics may most often be
      called energeticist physics,” although this
      designation does not fit, for example, such a representative of
      conceptualist physics as Mach (p. 46).
    

Rey’s identification of energetics with Machism is not
      altogether correct, of course; nor is his assurance that the

    

neo-mechanistic school as well is approaching a phenomenalist
      view of physics (p. 48), despite the profundity of its
      disagreement with the conceptualists. Rey’s
      “new” terminology does not clarify, but rather
      obscures matters; but we could not avoid it if we were to give
      the reader an idea of how a “positivist” regards the
      crisis in physics. Essentially, the opposition of the
      “new” school to the old views fully coincides, as
      the reader may have convinced himself, with Kleinpeter’s
      criticism of Helmholtz quoted above. In his presentation of the
      views of the various physicists Rey reflects the indefiniteness
      and vacillation of their philosophical views. The
      essence of the crisis in modern physics consists in the
      breakdown of the old laws and basic principles, in the rejection
      of an objective reality existing outside the mind, that is, in
      the replacement of materialism by idealism and
      agnosticism. “Matter has disappeared"—one may thus
      express the fundamental and characteristic difficulty in
      relation to many of the particular questions, which has created
      this crisis. Let us pause to discuss this difficulty.

X-rays, Becquerel rays,radium—discoveries which,
      laid the basis for the development of atomic physics.
    

X-rays (Rontgen rays) are extremely short-wave electromagnetic
      radiation ’which can pass through media impenetrable by visible

   

light. They were discovered by the German physicist Wilhelm
      Konrad R6ntgen in December 1895 who described their main
      properties; later the nature of this radiation was discovered.

    

In 1896 the French physicist Antoine-Henri Becquerel, while
      studying the action of various fluorescent substances on photo
      graphic film, discovered that uranium salts affect such film in
      the dark even without previous exposure to light. By further
      experiments he showed that this action was due to a new form of
      radiation distinct from X-rays.



Investigating this new form of radiation, Pierre and Marie Curie
      established that it was due to a hitherto unknown property of
      matter, which they called radioactivity. As a result of their
      experiments two new radioactive elements were discovered:
      polonium and radium (1898). Later it was found that Becquerel’s
      rays consist of three components (alpha-, beta- and
      gamma-rays).
    



[2]
This discovery was made by lames Clerk Maxwell. By generalising
      Michael Faraday’s experimental results in the study of
      electromagnetic phenomena he created the theory of the
      electromagnetic field, from which it followed that changes of
      the electromagnetic field are propagated with the speed of
      light. On the basis of his researches, Maxwell in 1805 concluded
      that light consists of electromagnetic vibrations. In 1886-89
      his theory was confirmed experimentally by Heinrich Hertz, who
      proved the existence of electromagnetic waves.
    



[3]
The study of radioactivity revealed the existence of a special kind
      of radiation: alpha-, beta- and gamma-rays. In 1903, Ernest
      Rutherford and Frederick Soddy suggested that radioactivity was
      the spontaneous transformation of one chemical element into
      another. This was speedily confirmed by William Ramsay and
      Frederick Soddy, who discovered that helium was one of the
      products of radioactive disintegration of radon (1903). Shortly
      afterwards it was discovered that helium was formed by the
      disintegration of radium and other radioactiye elements showing
      alpha-radioactivity. This formation of helium was an important
      argument in favour of the theory of radioactive transformations,
      and could only be explained by supposing that alpha-rays are the
      nuclei of helium atoms. This was confirmed in 1909 by the
      experiments of T. Rutherford and T. Royds.

Lenin uses the concept of the ether, which was still generally
      accepted in physics at the beginning of the twentieth
      century. The idea of the ether as a special material medium
      filling all space and acting as the carrier of light,
      gravitational forces, etc., was put forward in the seventeenth
      century. Later, the notion of different forms of the ether,
      independent of one another (electromagnetic, magnetic, etc.) was
      introduced to explain various phenomena. Owing to the success of
      the wave theory of light, the concept of the luminiferous ether
      (Christian Huygens, Austin Frosnel and others) was especially
      developed; subsequently the hypothesis of a

   

single ether
      arose. As science developed, however, the concept of the ether
      came into contradiction with new facts. The untenability of the
      hypothesis of the ether as a universal mechanical medium was
      proved by the theory of relativity; the rational elements
      contained in the hypothesis of the ether were reflected in the
      quantum field theory (tile vacuum concept).

Lenin repeatedly pointed out the limited nature of Plekhanov’s
      criticism of Machism. In 1905, in connection with his preface to
      the second Russian edition of Engels’ Ludwig Feuerbaeh and
      the End of Classical German Philosophy, Lenin wrote: “How
      petty are his sallies and ’pinpricks against the Machists! For
      me this is the more to be regretted since Plekhanov’s criticism
      of Mach seems to me essentially correct" (Lenin Miscellany
      XXVI, p. 21). In 1907-08, in the works Fundamental
      Problems of Marxism, Materialismus militais and others,
      Plekhnnov criticised Machism and its adherents in Russia
      (Bogdanov, Lunacharsky and others) and pointed out the fallacy
      of their attempts to combine Marxism with the
      subjective-idealist philosophy of Mach and Avenarius. In so
      doing, Plekhanov “was less concerned with refuting Mach than
      with dealing a factional blow at Bolshevism” (see p. 355 of this
      volume).

    

Plekhanov’s opposition to Machism played a positive part in
      defending Marxist philosophy from the attacks of the
      revisionists, but he did not give a deep theoretical analysis of
      empirio-criticism, and did not reveal the direct dependence of
      Machism on the crisis in natural science, confining himself to a
      criticism of the idealist epistemological views of some of its
      adherents.

The description of the concept of mass given by Henri
      Poincaré and quoted by Lenin was in accord with the level
      of development of physics at that time. The development of the
      electronic theory that followed the discovery of the electron
      made it possible to explain the nature of the mass of the
      electron. Joseph John Thom son advanced the hypothesis that the
      actual mass of the electron is determined by the energy of the
      electromagnetic field (i.e., the inertia of the electron is due
      to the inertia of the field). The concept of the electromagnetic
      mass of the electron was introduced, and this mass was found to
      depend on the velocity of motion of the electron. The mechanical
      mass of the electron, however, like that of any other particle,
      was regarded as unchanging. The existence of the mechanical mass
      should have been revealed by experiments on the dependence of
      the electromagnetic mass of the electron on its
      velocity. However, these experiments, performed by Walter
      Kaufmann in 1901-02, unexpectedly showed that the electron
      behaved as if all its mass was of an electromagnetic
      nature. Hence the conclusion was drawn that, in the case of the
      electron,

   

mechanical mass, which was formerly regarded as an
      inalienable property of matter, has disappeared. This
      circumstance gave rise to various kinds of philosophical
      speculations and statements about the "disappearance of matter’,
      the fallacy of which was demonstrated by Lenin. The further
      development of physics (relativity theory) showed that
      mechanical mass also depends on velocity of motion and that the
      mass of the electron cannot be reduced wholly to electromagnetic
      mass.

( Chapter Five: The Recent Revolution in Natural Science and Philosophical Idealism )
2. “Matter Has Disappeared”

Such, literally, is the expression that may be encountered in
      the descriptions given by modern physicists of recent
      discoveries. For instance, L. Houllevigue, in his book The
      Evolution of the Sciences, entitles his chapter on the new
      theories of matter: “Does Matter Exist?” He says:
      “The atom dematerialises, matter
disappears.”[1]

To see how easily fundamental
      philosophical conclusions are drawn from this by the Machians,
      let us take Valentinov. He writes: “The statement that the
      scientific explanation of the world can find a firm foundation
      only in materialism is nothing but a fiction, and what is more,
      an absurd fiction” (p. 67). He quotes as a destroyer of
      this absurd fiction Augusto Righi, the well-known Italian
      physicist, who says that the electron theory “is not so
      much a theory of electricity

    

as of matter; the new system simply
      puts electricity in the place of matter.” (Augusto Righi,
      Die moderne Theorie der physikalischen Erscheinungen,

[The Modern Theory of Physical Phenomena],

Leipzig, 1905, S. 131.
There is a Russian translation.)
      Having quoted these words (p. 64), Mr. Valentinov exclaims:
    

      “Why does Righi permit himself to commit this offence
      against sacred matter? Is it perhaps because he is a solipsist,
      an idealist, a bourgeois criticist, an empirio-monist, or even
      someone worse?”
    

This remark, which seems to Mr. Valentinov to annihilate the
      materialists by its sarcasm, only discloses his virgin innocence
      on the subject of philosophical materialism. Mr. Valentinov has
      no suspicion of the real connection between
      philosophical idealism and the “disappearance of
      matter.” The “disappearance of matter” of
      which he speaks, in imitation of the modern physicists, has
      no relation to the epistemological distinction between
      materialism and idealism. To make this clear, let us take one of
      the most consistent and clearest of the Machians, Karl
      Pearson. For him the physical universe consists of groups of
      sense-impressions. He illustrates “our conceptual model of
      the physical universe” by the following diagram,
      explaining, however, that it takes no account of relative sizes
      (The Grammar of Science, p. 282):–
    




In order to simplify his diagram, Karl Pearson entirely omits
      the question of the relation between ether and electricity, or
      positive electrons and negative electrons. But that is not
      important. What is important is that from Pearson’s
      idealist standpoint “bodies” are first regarded as
      sense-impressions, and then the constitution of these bodies out
      of

    

particles, particles out of molecules and so forth affects
      the changes in the model of the physical world, but in no way
      affects the question of whether bodies are symbols of
      perceptions, or perceptions images of bodies. Materialism and
      idealism differ in their respective answers to the question of
      the source of our knowledge and of the relation of
      knowledge (and of the “mental” in general) to the
      physical world; while the question of the structure of
      matter, of atoms and electrons, is a question that concerns only
      this “physical world.” When the physicists say that
      “matter is disappearing,” they mean that hitherto
      science reduced its investigations of the physical world to
      three ultimate concepts: matter, electricity and ether; whereas
      now only the two latter remain. For it has become
      possible to reduce matter to electricity; the atom can be
      explained as resembling an infinitely small solar system, within
      which negative
electrons[3] move around a positive
electron[4] with a
      definite (and, as we have seen, enormously large) velocity. It
      is consequently possible to reduce the physical world from
      scores of elements to two or three elements (inasmuch as
      positive and negative electrons constitute “two
      essentially distinct kinds of matter,” as the physicist
      Pellat says—Rey, op. cit.,
      pp. 294-95). Hence, natural science leads to the
      “unity of matter”
(ibid.)[2]

—such

      is the real meaning of the statement regarding the disappearance
      of matter, its replacement by electricity, etc., which is
      leading so many people astray. “Matter is
      disappearing” means that the limit within which we have
      hitherto known matter is vanishing and that our knowledge is
      penetrating deeper; properties of matter are likewise
      disappearing which formerly seemed absolute, immutable, and
      primary (impenetrability, inertia,
mass,[5] etc.) and which are now
      revealed to be relative and characteristic only of certain
      states of matter. For the sole “property”
      of matter with whose recognition philosophical

    

materialism is
      bound up is the property of being an objective reality,
      of existing outside our mind.
    

The error of Machism in general, as of the Machian new physics,
      is that it ignores this basis of philosophical materialism and
      the distinction between metaphysical materialism and dialectical
      materialism. The recognition of immutable elements, “of
      the immutable substance of things,” and so forth, is not
      materialism, but metaphysical, i.e.,
      anti-dialectical, materialism. That is why J. Dietzgen
      emphasised that the “subject-matter of science is
      endless,” that not only the in finite, but the
      “smallest atom” is immeasurable, unknowable to the
      end, inexhaustible, “for nature in all her parts
      has no beginning and no end” (Kleinere philosophische
      Schriften, S. 229-30). That is why Engels gave the example
      of the discovery of alizarin in coal tar and criticised
      mechanical materialism. In order to present the
      question in the only correct way, that is, from the dialectical
      materialist standpoint, we must ask: Do electrons, ether and
      so on exist as objective realities outside the human mind
      or not? The scientists will also have to answer this question
      unhesitatingly; and they do invariably answer it in the
      affirmative, just as they unhesitatingly recognise that
      nature existed prior to man and prior to organic matter. Thus,
      the question is decided in favour of materialism, for the
      concept matter, as we already stated, epistemologically implies
      nothing but objective reality existing independently of
      the human mind and renected by it.
    

But dialectical materialism insists on the approximate, relative
      character of every scientific theory of the structure of matter
      and its properties; it insists on the absence of absolute
      boundaries in nature, on the transformation of moving matter
      from one state into another, which is to us apparently
      irreconcilable with it, and so forth. However bizarre from the
      standpoint of “common sense” the transformation of
      imponderable ether into ponderable matter and vice
      versa may appear, however “strange” may seem
      the absence of any other kind of mass in the electron save
      electromagnetic mass, however extraordinary may be the fact that
      the mechanical laws of motion are confined only to a single
      sphere of natural phenomena and are subordinated to the more
      profound laws of electromagnetic phenomena, and so
      forth—all

    

this is but another corroboration of
      dialectical materialism. It is mainly because the physicists did
      not know dialectics that the new physics strayed into
      idealism. They combated metaphysical (in Engels’, and not
      the positivist, i.e., Humean, sense of the word)
      materialism and its one-sided “mechanism,” and in so
      doing threw the baby out with the bath-water. Denying the
      immutability of the elements and the properties of matter known
      hitherto, they ended in denying matter, i.e., the
      objective reality of the physical world. Denying the absolute
      character of some of the most important and basic laws, they
      ended in denying all objective law in nature and in declaring
      that a law of nature is a mere convention, “a limitation
      of expectation,” “a logical necessity,” and so
      forth. Insisting on the approximate and relative character of
      our knowledge, they ended in denying the object independent of
      the mind and reflected approximately-correctly and
      relatively-truthfully by the mind. And so on, and so forth,
      without end.
    

The opinions expressed by Bogdanov in 1899 regarding “the
      immutable essence of things,” the opinions of Valentinov
      and Yushkevich regarding “substance,” and so
      forth—are similar fruits of ignorance of dialectics. From
      Engels’ point of view, the only immutability is the
      reflection by the human mind (when there is a human mind) of an
      external world existing and developing independently of the
      mind. No other “immutability,” no other
      “essence,” no other “absolute
      substance,” in the sense in which these concepts were
      depicted by the empty professorial philosophy, exist for Marx
      and Engels. The “essence” of things, or
      “substance,” is also relative; it expresses
      only the degree of profundity of man’s knowledge of
      objects; and while yesterday the profundity of this knowledge
      did not go beyond the atom, and today does not go beyond the
      electron and ether, dialectical materialism insists on the
      temporary, relative, approximate character of all these
      milestones in the knowledge of nature gained by the
      progressing science of man. The electron is as
      inexhaustible as the atom, nature is infinite, but it
      infinitely exists. And it is this sole categorical,
      this sole unconditional recognition of nature’s
      existence outside the mind and perception of man that
      distinguishes dialectical materialism from relativist
      agnosticism and idealism.
    
 

Let us cite two examples of the way in which the new physics
      wavers unconsciously and instinctively between dialectical
      materialism, which remains unknown to the bourgeois scientists,
      and “phenomenalism,” with its inevitable
      subjectivist (and, subsequently, directly fideist) deductions.
    

This same Augusto Righi, from whom Mr. Valentinov was
      unable to get a reply on the question which interested
      him about materialism, writes in the introduction to his book:
      “What the electrons, or electrical atoms, really are
      remains even now a mystery; but in spite of this, the new theory
      is perhaps destined in time to achieve no small philosophical
      significance, since it is arriving at entirely new hypotheses
      regarding the structure of ponderable matter and is striving to
      reduce all phenomena of the external world to one common
      origin.
    

      “For the positivist and utilitarian tendencies of our time
      such an advantage may be of small consequence, and a theory is
      perhaps regarded primarily as a means of conveniently ordering
      and summarising facts and as a guide in the search for further
      phenomena. But while in former times perhaps too much confidence
      was placed in the faculties of the human mind, and it was
      considered too easy to grasp the ultimate causes of all things,
      there is nowadays a tendency to fall into the opposite
      error” (op. cit., p. 3).
    

Why does Righi dissociate himself here from the positivist and
      utilitatian tendencies? Because, while apparently he has no
      definite philosophical standpoint, he instinctively clings to
      the reality of the external world and to the recognition that
      the new theory is not only a “convenience”
      (Poincaré), not only an “empirio-symbol”
      (Yushkevich), not only a “harmonising of experience”
      (Bogdanov), or whatever else they call such subjectivist
      fancies, but a further step in the cognition of objective
      reality. Had this physicist been acquainted with
      dialectical materialism, his opinion of the error which
      is the opposite of the old metaphysical materialism might
      perhaps have become the starting point of a correct
      philosophy. But these people’s whole environment estranges
      them from Marx and Engels and throws them into the embrace of
      vulgar official philosophy.
    

Rey too is entirely unfamiliar with dialectics. But he too is
      compelled to state that among the modern physicists

    

there are
      those who continue the traditions of “mechanism”
      (i.e., materialism). The path of
      “mechanism,” says he, is pursued not only by
      Kirchhoff, Hertz, Boltzmann, Maxwell, Helmholtz and Lord
      Kelvin. “Pure mechanists, and in some respects more
      mechanist than anybody else, and representing the culmination
      (l’aboutissant) of mechanism, are those who
      follow Lorentz and Larmor in formulating an electrical theory of
      matter and who arrive at a denial of the constancy of mass,
      declaring it to be a function of motion. They are all
      mechanists because they take real motion as their starting
      point” (Rey’s italics, pp. 290-91).
    

      “. . . If, for example, the recent hypotheses of Lorentz,
      Larmor and Langevin were, thanks to certain experimental
      confirmation, to obtain a sufficiently stable basis for the
      systematisation of physics, it would be certain that the laws of
      present-day mechanics are nothing but a corollary of the laws of
      electromagnetism: they would constitute a special case of the
      latter within well-defined limits. Constancy of mass and our
      principle of inertia would be valid only for moderate velocities
      of bodies, the term ‘moderate’ being taken in
      relation to our senses and to the phenomena which constitute our
      general experience. A general recasting of mechanics would
      result, and hence also, a general recasting of the
      systematisation of physics.”
    

      “Would this imply the abandonment of mechanism? By no
      means. The purely mechanist tradition would still be followed,
      and mechanism would follow its normal course of
      development” (p. 295).
    

      “Electronic physics, which should be ranked among the
      theories of a generally mechanist spirit, tends at present to
      impose its systematisation on physics. Although the fundamental
      principles of this electronic physics are not furnished by
      mechanics but by the experimental data of the theory of
      electricity, its spirit is mechanistic, because: (1) It uses
      figurative (figurés), material elements
      to represent physical properties and their laws; it expresses
      itself in terms of perception. (2) While it no longer regards
      physical phenomena as particular cases of mechanical phenomena,
      it regards mechanical phenomena as particular cases of physical
      phenomena. The laws of mechanics thus retain their direct
      continuity with the laws of physics; and the concepts of

    

mechanics remain concepts of the same order as physico-chemical
      concepts. In traditional mechanism it was motions copied
      (calqués) from relatively slow motions,
      which, since they alone were known and most directly observable,
      were taken. . . as a type of all possible motions. Recent
      experiments, on the contrary, show that it is necessary to
      extend our conception of possible motions. Traditional
      mechanics remains entirely intact, but it now applies only to
      relatively slow motions. . . . In relation to large velocities,
      the laws of motion are different. Matter appears to be reduced
      to electrical particles, the ultimate elements of the
      atom. . . . (3) Motion, displacement in space, remains the only
      figurative (figuré) element of physical
      theory. (4) Finally, what from the standpoint of the general
      spirit of physics comes before every other consideration is the
      fact that the conception of physics, its methods, its theories,
      and their relation to experience remains absolutely
      identical with the conception of mechanism, with the
      conception of physics held since the Renaissance”
      (pp. 46-47).
    

I have given this long quotation from Rey in full because owing
      to his perpetual anxiety to avoid “materialist
      metaphysics,” it would have been impossible to expound his
      statements in any other way. But however much both Rey and the
      physicists of whom he speaks abjure materialism, it is
      nevertheless beyond question that mechanics was a copy of real
      motions of moderate velocity, while the new physics is a copy of
      real motions of enormous velocity. The recognition of theory as
      a copy, as an approximate copy of objective reality, is
      materialism. When Rey says that among modern physicists there
      “is a reaction against the conceptualist [Machian] and
      energeticist school,” and when he ranks the physicists of
      the electron theory among the representatives of this reaction
      (p. 46), we could desire no better corroboration of the fact
      that the struggle is essentially between the materialist and the
      idealist tendencies. But we must not forget that, apart from the
      general prejudices against materialism common to all educated
      philistines, the most outstanding theoreticians are handicapped
      by a complete ignorance of dialectics.

      first edited by Alfred Binet, and afterwards by H. Piéron
    



[3]
The idea of the compound nature of the atom arose at the end of the
      nineteenth century as a result of the discovery of the periodic
      system of elements by Mendeleyev, the electromagnetic nature of
      light, the electron, and the phenomena of radioactivity. Various
      models of the atom were proposed. Lenin regarded as most
      probable the planetary model, the idea of which ’was advanced as
      a guess at the end of the nineteenth century. It was
      experimentally confirmed by Ernest Rutherford, who investigated
      the penetration of various substances by alpha-particles
      (positively charged helium nuclei) and came to the conclusion
      that the positive charge is concentrated at the centre of the
      atom, occupying a very small part of the latter’s volume. In
      1911 he suggested a model of the atom having a positively
      charged nucleus at the centre, with a mass almost equal to the
      whole mass of the atom, around which electrons revolve in
      various orbits, like planets round the sun. This model, however,
      could not explain the stability of the atom. The first
      successful attempt to create a theory of atomic structure was
      based on Rutherford’s model and made use of the quantum
      postulates of Niels Bohr (1913). According to this first quantum
      theory of the atom, an electron moves in one of the “stable”
      orbits (corresponding to definite discrete energy values)
      without radiation; radiation or absorption of a definite portion
      of energy by the atom occurs only on the passage of the electron
      from one orbit to another.

    

Further advances in physics enriched the representation of the
      structure of the atom. An important part was played here by
      Louis de Broglie’s prediction of wave properties of
      micro-objects and the subsequent creation of quantum mechanics
      by Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg and
      others. According to modern ideas the atomic nucleus is
      surrounded by a cloud of electrons, which occupy various orbits
      corresponding to definite energy values, and which form with the
      nucleus a single interconnected system.

    

The development of physics has shown that the atomic nucleus
      consists of elementary particles—nucleons (protons and
      neutrons). New properties of the electron—besides its mass
      and charge, which were already known in the early twentieth
      century—have been discovered, including the possibility of
      its conversion into other particles. In addition to the
      electron, a number of new elementary

   

particles with diverse
      properties have been discovered (photons, protons, neutrons,
      neutrinos, various kinds of mesons and hype Ions). Particles
      have also been, discovered which possess characteristics equal
      in magnitude to those of other particles but of opposite sign
      (so-called anti-particles).

    

The development of knowledge of the structure of matter has led
      to man’s mastery over nuclear processes and the utilisation of
      nuclear energy, initiating a new technical revolution of
      tremendous significance for the future of mankind.

Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Five: The Recent Revolution in Natural Science and Philosophical Idealism )
3. Is Motion Without Matter Conceivable?

The fact that philosophical idealism is attempting to make use
      of the new physics, or that idealist conclusions are being drawn
      from the latter, is due not to the discovery of new kinds of
      substance and force, of matter and motion, but to the fact that
      an attempt is being made to conceive motion without matter. And
      it is the essence of this attempt which our Machians fail to
      examine. They were unwilling to take account of Engels’
      statement that “motion without matter is
      unthinkable.” J. Dietzgen in 1869, in his The Nature
      of tbe Workings of the Human Mind, expressed the same idea
      as Engels, although, it is true, not without his usual muddled
      attempts to “reconcile” materialism and
      idealism. Let us leave aside these attempts, which are to a
      large extent to be explained by the fact that Dietzgen is
      arguing against Büchner’s non-dialectical
      materialism, and let us examine Dietzgen’s own statements
      on the question under consideration. He says: “They [the
      idealists] want to have the general without the particular, mind
      without matter, force without substance, science without
      experience or material, the absolute without the relative”
      (Das Wesen der menschlichen Kopfarbeit, 1903,
      S. 108). Thus the endeavour to divorce motion from matter, force
      from substance, Dietzgen associates with idealism, compares with
      the endeavour to divorce thought from the
      brain. “Liebig,” Dietzgen continues, “who is
      especially fond of straying from his inductive science into the
      field of speculation, says in the spirit of idealism:
      ‘force cannot be seen’” (p. 109). “The
      spiritualist or the idealist believes in the spiritual,
      i.e., ghostlike and inexplicable, nature of
      force” (p. 110). “The antithesis between force and
      matter is as old as the antithesis between idealism and
      materialism” (p. 111). “Of course, there is no force
      without matter, no matter without force; forceless matter and
      matterless force are absurdities. If there are idealist natural
      scientists who believe in the immaterial existence of forces, on
      this point they are not natural scientists. . . but seers of
      ghosts” (p. 114).
    

We thus see that scientists who were prepared to grant that
      motion is conceivable without matter were to be encountered
      forty years ago too, and that “on this point”
      Dietzgen declared them to be seers of ghosts. What, then, is

    

the
      connection between philosophical idealism and the divorce of
      matter from motion, the separation of substance from force? Is
      it not “more economical,” indeed, to conceive motion
      without matter?
    

Let us imagine a consistent idealist who holds that the entire
      world is his sensation, his idea, etc. (if we take
      “nobody’s” sensation or idea, this changes
      only the variety of philosophical idealism but not its
      essence). The idealist would not even think of denying that the
      world is motion, i.e., the motion of his thoughts,
      ideas, sensations. The question as to what moves, the
      idealist will reject and regard as absurd: what is taking place
      is a change of his sensations, his ideas come and go, and
      nothing more. Outside him there is nothing. “It
      moves"—and that is all. It is impossible to conceive a
      more “economical” way of thinking. And no proofs,
      syllogisms, or definitions are capable of refuting the solipsist
      if he consistently adheres to his view.
    

The fundamental distinction between the materialist and the
      adherent of idealist philosophy consists in the fact that the
      materialist regards sensation, perception, idea, and the mind of
      man generally, as an image of objective reality. The world is
      the movement of this objective reality reflected by our
      consciousness. To the movement of ideas, perceptions, etc.,
      there corresponds the movement of matter outside me. The concept
      matter expresses nothing more than the objective reality which
      is given us in sensation. Therefore, to divorce motion from
      matter is equivalent to divorcing thought from objective
      reality, or to divorcing my sensations from the external
      world—in a word, it is to go over to idealism. The trick
      which is usually performed in denying matter, and in assuming
      motion without matter, consists in ignoring the relation of
      matter to thought. The question is presented as though this
      relation did not exist, but in reality it is introduced
      surreptitiously; at the beginning of the argument it remains
      unexpressed, but subsequently crops up more or less
      imperceptibly.
    

Matter has disappeared, they tell us, wishing from this to draw
      epistemological conclusions. But has thought remained?—we
      ask. If not, if with the disappearance of matter thought has
      also disappeared, if with the disappearance

    

of the brain and
      nervous system ideas and sensations, too, have
      disappeared—then it follows that everything has
      disappeared. And your argument has disappeared as a sample of
      “thought” (or lack of thought)! But if it has
      remained—if it is assumed that with the disappearance of
      matter, thought (idea, sensation, etc.) does not disappear, then
      you have surreptitiously gone over to the standpoint of
      philosophical idealism. And this always happens with people who
      wish, for “economy’s sake,” to conceive of
      motion without matter, for tacitly, by the very fact
      that they continue to argue, they are acknowledging the
      existence of thought after the disappearance of
      matter. This means that a very simple, or a very complex
      philosophical idealism is taken as a basis; a very simple one,
      if it is a case of frank solipsism (I exist, and the
      world is only my sensation); a very complex one, if
      instead of the thought, ideas and sensations of a living person,
      a dead abstraction is posited, that is, nobody’s thought,
      nobody’s idea, nobody’s sensation, but thought in
      general (the Absolute Idea, the Universal Will, etc.), sensation
      as an indeterminate “element,” the
      “psychical,” which is substituted for the whole of
      physical nature, etc., etc. Thousands of shades of varieties of
      philosophical idealism are possible and it is always possible to
      create a thousand and first shade; and to the author of this
      thousand and first little system (empirio-monism, for example)
      what distinguishes it from the rest may appear to be
      momentous. From the standpoint of materialism, however, the
      distinction is absolutely unessential. What is essential is the
      point of departure. What is essential is that the attempt to
      think of motion without matter smuggles in
      thought divorced from matter—and that is
      philosophical idealism.
    

Therefore, for example, the English Machian Karl Pearson, the
      clearest and most consistent of the Machians, who is averse to
      verbal trickery, directly begins the seventh chapter of his
      book, devoted to “matter,” with the characteristic
      heading “All things move—but only in
      conception.” “It is therefore, for the sphere of
      perception, idle to ask what moves and why it moves”
      (The Grammar of Science, p. 243).
    

Therefore, too, in the case of Bogdanov, his philosophical
      misadventures in fact began before his acquaintance with

    

Mach. They began from the moment he put his trust in the
      assertion of the eminent chemist, but poor philosopher, Ostwald,
      that motion can be thought of without matter. It is all the more
      fitting to pause on this long-past episode in Bogdanov’s
      philosophical development since it is impossible when speaking
      of the connection between philosophical idealism and certain
      trends in the new physics to ignore Ostwald’s
      “energetics.”
    

      “We have already said,” wrote Bogdanov in 1899,
      “that the nineteenth century did not succeed in ultimately
      ridding itself of the problem of ‘the immutable essence of
      things.’ This essence, under the name of
      ‘matter,’ even holds an important place in the world
      outlook of the foremost thinkers of the century”
      (Fundamental Elements of the Historical Outlook on
      Nature, p. 38).
    

We said that this is a sheer muddle. The recognition of the
      objective reality of the outer world, the recognition of the
      existence outside our mind of eternally moving and eternally
      changing matter, is here confused with the recognition of the
      immutable essence of things. It is hardly possible that Bogdanov
      in 1899 did not rank Marx and Engels among the “foremost
      thinkers.” But he obviously did not understand dialectical
      materialism.
    

      “. . . In the processes of nature two aspects are usually
      still distinguished: matter and-its motion. It cannot be said
      that the concept matter is distinguished by great clarity. It is
      not easy to give a satisfactory answer to the
      question—what is matter? It is defined as the ‘cause
      of sensations’ or as the ‘permanent possibility of
      sensation’; but it is evident that matter is here confused
      with motion. . . .”
    

It is evident that Bogdanov is arguing incorrectly. Not only
      does he confuse the materialist recognition of an objective
      source of sensations (unclearly formulated in the words
      “cause of sensations") with Mill’s agnostic
      definition of matter as the permanent possibility of
      sensation, but the chief error here is that the author, having
      boldly approached the question of the existence or non-existence
      of an objective source of sensations, abandons this question
      half-way and jumps to another question, the question of the
      existence or non-existence of matter without motion. The
      idealist may regard the world as the movement of our
      sensations (even

    

though “socially organised” and
      “harmonised” to the highest degree); the materialist
      regards the world as the movement of an objective source, of an
      objective model of our sensations. The metaphysical,
      i.e., anti-dialectical, materialist may accept the
      existence of matter without motion (even though temporarily,
      before “the first impulse,” etc.). The dialectical
      materialist not only regards motion as an inseparable property
      of matter, but rejects the simplified view of motion and so
      forth.
    

      “. . . The most exact definition would, perhaps, be the
      following: ‘matter is what moves’; but this is as
      devoid of content as though one were to say that matter is the
      subject of a sentence, the predicate of which is
      ‘moves.’ The fact, most likely, is that in the epoch
      of statics men were wont to see something necessarily solid in
      the role of the subject, an ‘object,’ and such an
      inconvenient thing for statical thought as ‘motion’
      they were prepared to tolerate only as a predicate, as one of
      the attributes of ‘matter.’”
 

This is something like the charge Akimov brought against the
      Iskra-ists, namely, that their programme did not
      contain the word proletariat in the nominative
case![2]
      Whether we say the world is moving matter, or that the world is
      material motion, makes no difference whatever.
    

      “ . . . But energy must have a vehicle—say those who
      believe in matter. Why?—asks Ostwald, and with
      reason. Must nature necessarily consist of subject and
      predicate?” (p. 39)
    

Ostwald’s answer, which so pleased Bogdanov in 1899, is
      plain sophistry. Must our judgments necessarily consist of
      electrons and ether?—one might retort to Ostwald. As a
      matter of fact, the mental elimination from “nature”
      of matter as the “subject” only implies the tacit
      admission into philosophy of thought as the
      “subject” (i.e., as the primary, the
      starting point, independent of matter). Not the subject, but the
      objective source of sensation is eliminated, and
      sensation becomes the “subject,”
      i.e., philosophy becomes Berke leian, no matter in what
      trappings the word “sensation” is afterwards
      decked. Ostwald endeavoured to avoid this inevitable
      philosophical alternative (materialism or idealism) by an
      indefinite use of the word “energy,” but this very
      endeavour only once again goes to prove the futility of such
      artifices. If energy is motion, you have only shifted

    

the
      difficulty from the subject to the predicate, you have only
      changed the question, does matter move? into the question, is
      energy material? Does the transformation of energy take place
      outside my mind, independently of man and mankind, or are these
      only ideas, symbols, conventional signs, and so forth? And this
      question proved fatal to the “energeticist”
      philosophy, that attempt to disguise old epistemological errors
      by a “new” terminology.
    

Here are examples of how the energeticist Ostwald got into a
      muddle. In the preface to his Lectures on Natural
      Philosophy[1]

he declares that he regards
      “as a great gain the simple and natural removal of the old
      difficulties in the way of uniting the concepts matter and
      spirit by subordinating both to the concept energy.” This
      is not a gain, but a loss, because the question whether
      epistemological investigation (Ostwald does not clearly realise
      that he is raising an epistemological and not a chemical issue!)
      is to be conducted along materialist or idealist lines is not
      being solved but is being confused by an arbitrary use of the
      term “energy.” Of course, if we
      “subordinate” both matter and mind to this concept,
      the verbal annihilation of the antithesis is beyond
      question, but the absurdity of the belief in sprites and
      hobgoblins, for instance, is not removed by calling it
      “energetics.” On page 394 of Ostwald’s
      Lectures we read: “That all external events may
      be presented as an interaction of energies can be most simply
      explained if our mental processes are themselves energetic and
      impose (aufprägen) this property of theirs on all
      external phenornena.” This is pure idealism: it is not our
      thought that reflects the transformation of energy in the
      external world, but the external world that reflects a certain
      “property” of our mind! The American philosopher
      Hibben, pointing to this and similar passages in Ostwald’s
      Lectures, aptly says that Ostwald “appears in a
      Kantian disguise": the explicability of the phenomena of the
      external world is deduced from the properties of our mind!
      “It is obvious therefore,” says Hibben, “that
      if the primary

    

concept of energy is so defined as to embrace
      psychical phenomena, we have no longer the simple concept of
      energy as understood and recognised in scientific circles or
      among the Energetiker


themselves....”[J. G. Hibben, “The Theory of Energetics and
      Its Philosophical Bearings,” The Monist,
      Vol. XIII, No. 3, April 1903, pp. 329-30.]

The
      transformation of energy is regarded by science as an objective
      process independent of the minds of men and of the experience of
      mankind, that is to say, it is regarded materialistically. And
      by energy, Ostwald himself in many instances, probably in the
      vast majority of instances, means material motion.
    

And this accounts for the remarkable phenomenon that Bogdanov, a
      disciple of Ostwald, having become a disciple of Mach, began to
      reproach Ostwald not because he does not adhere consistently to
      a materialistic view of energy, but because he admits the
      materialistic view of energy (and at times even takes it as his
      basis). The materialists criticise Ostwald because he lapses
      into idealism, because he attempts to reconcile materialism and
      idealism. Bogdanov criticises Ostwald from the idealist
      standpoint. In 1906 he wrote: “. . . Ostwald’s
      energetics, hostile to atomism but for the rest closely akin to
      the old materialism, enlisted my heartiest sympathy. I soon
      noticed, however, an important contradiction in his
      Naturphilosohhie : although he frequently emphasises
      the purely methodological significance of the concept
      ‘energy,’ in a great number of instances he himself
      fails to adhere to it. He every now and again converts
      ‘energy’ from a pure symbol of correlations between
      the facts of experience into the substance of
      experience, into the ‘world stuff’”
  (Empirio-Monism, Bk. III, pp. xvi-xvii).
    

Energy is a pure symbol! After this Bogdanov may dispute as much
      as he pleases with the “empirio-symbolist”
      Yushkevich, with the “pure Machians,” the
      empirio-criticists, etc.—from the standpoint of the
      materialist it is a dispute between a man who believes in a
      yellow devil and a man who believes in a green devil. For the
      important thing is not the differences between Bogdanov and the
      other Machians, but what they have in common, to wit: the
      idealist interpretation of “experience” and
      “energy,” the denial of objective reality,
      adaptation to which constitutes human experience and the copying
      of which constitutes the only scientific
      “methodology” and scientific
      “energetics.”
    
 

      “It [Ostwald’s energetics] is indifferent to the
      material of the world, it is fully compatible with both the old
      materialism and pan-psychism” (i.e.,
      philosophical idealism?) (p. xvii). And Bogdanov departed from
      muddled energetics not by the materialist road but
      by the idealist road. . . . “When energy is
      represented as substance it is nothing but the old materialism
      minus the absolute atoms—materialism with a correction in
      the sense of the continuity of the existing”
      (ibid.). Yes, Bogdanov left the “old”
      materialism, i.e., the metaphysical materialism of the
      scientists, not for dialectical materialism, which he
      understood as little in 1906 as he did in 1899, but for idealism
      and fideism; for no educated representative of modern fideism,
      no immanentist, no “neo-criticist,” and so forth,
      will object to the “methodological” conception of
      energy, to its interpretation as a “pure symbol of
      correlation of the facts of experience.” Take Paul Carus,
      with whose mental make-up we have already become sufficiently
      acquainted, and you will find that this Machian criticises
      Ostwald in the very same way as Bogdanov :
      “. . . Materialism and energetics are exactly in the same
      predicament” (The Monist, Vol. XVII, 1907, No. 4,
      p. 536). “We are very little helped by materialism when we
      are told that everything is matter, that bodies are matter, and
      that thoughts are merely a function of matter, and Professor
      Ostwald’s energetics is not a whit better when it tells us
      that matter is energy, and that the soul too is only a factor of
      energy” (p. 533).
    

Ostwald’s energetics is a good example of how quickly a
      “new” terminology becomes fashionable, and how
      quickly it turns out that a somewhat altered mode of expression
      can in no way eliminate fundamental philosophical questions and
      fundamental philosophical trends. Both materialism and idealism
      can be expressed in terms of “energetics” (more or
      less consistently, of course) just as they can be expressed in
      terms of “experience,” and the like. Energeticist
      physics is a source of new idealist attempts to conceive motion
      without matter—because of the disintegration of particles
      of matter which hitherto had been accounted non-disintegrable
      and because of the discovery of heretofore unknown forms of
      material motion.

( Chapter Five: The Recent Revolution in Natural Science and Philosophical Idealism )
4. The Two Trends in Modern Physics and
English Spiritualism

In order to illustrate concretely the philosophical battle
      raging in present-day literature over the various conclusions
      drawn from the new physics, we shall let certain of the direct
      participants in the “fray” speak for themselves, and
      we shall begin with the English. The physicist Arthur
      W. Rücker defends one trend—from the standpoint of
      the natural scientist; the philosopher James Ward another
      trend—from the standpoint of epistemology.
    

At the meeting of the British Association held in Glasgow in
      1901, A. W. Rücker, the president of the physics section,
      chose as the subject of his address the question of the value of
      physical theory and especially the doubts that have arisen as to
      the existence of atoms, and of the ether. The speaker referred
      to the physicists Poincaré and Poynting (an English man who
      shares the views of the symbolists, or Machians), who raised
      this problem, to the philosopher Ward, and to E. Haeckel’s
      famous book and attempted to present his own
views.[1]


      “The question at issue,” said Rücker, “is
      whether the hypotheses which are at the base of the scientihc
      theories now most generally accepted, are to be regarded as
      accurate descriptions of the constitution of the universe around
      us, or merely as convenient fictions.” (In the terms used
      in our controversy with Bogdanov, Yushkevich and Co.: are they a
      copy of objective reality, of moving matter, or are they only a
      “methodology,” a “pure symbol,” mere
      “forms of organisation of experience"?) Rücker agrees
      that in practice there may prove to be no difference between the
      two theories; the direction of a river can be determined as well
      by one who examines only the blue streak on a map or diagram as
      by one who knows that this streak represents a real
      river. Theory, from the standpoint of a convenient fiction, will
      be an “aid to memory,” a means of “producing
      order” in our observations in accordance with some
      artificial system, of “arranging

    

our knowledge,”
      reducing it to equations, etc. We can, for instance, confine
      ourselves to declaring heat to be a form of motion or energy,
      thus exchanging “a vivid conception of moving atoms for a
      colourless statement of heat energy, the real nature of which we
      do not attempt define.” While fully recognising the
      possibility of achieving great scientific successes by this
      method, Rücker “ventures to assert that the
      exposition of such a system of tactics cannot be regarded as the
      last word of science in the struggle for the truth.” The
      questions still force themselves upon us: “Can we argue
      back from the phenomenon displayed by matter to the constitution
      of matter itself; whether we have any reason to believe that the
      sketch which science has already drawn is to some extent a copy,
      and not a mere dia gram of the truth?”
    

Analysing the problem of the structure of matter, Rücker
      takes air as an example, saying that it consists of gases and
      that science resolves “an elementary gas into a mixture of
      atoms and ether. . . . There are those who cry
      ‘Halt’; molecules and atoms cannot be directly
      perceived; they are mere conceptions, which have their uses, but
      cannot be regarded as realities.” Rücker meets this
      objection by referring to one of numberless instances in the
      development of science: the rings of Saturn appear to be a
      continuous mass when observed through a telescope. The
      mathematicians proved by calculation that this is impossible and
      spectral analysis corroborated the conclusion reached on the
      basis of the calculations. Another objection: properties are
      attributed to atoms and ether such as our senses do not disclose
      in ordinary matter. Rücker answers this also, referring to
      such examples as the diffusion of gases and liquids, etc. A
      number of facts, observations and experiments prove that matter
      consists of discrete particles or grains. Whether these
      particles, atoms, are distinct from the surrounding
      “original medium” or “basic medium”
      (ether), or whether they are parts of this medium in a
      particular state, is still an open question, and has no bearing
      on the theory of the existence of atoms. There is no ground for
      denying a priori the evidence of experiments showing
      that “quasi-material substances” exist which differ
      from ordinary matter (atoms and ether). Particular errors are
      here inevitable, but the aggregate of scientific

    

data leaves no
      room for doubting the existence of atoms and molecules.
    

Rücker then refers to the new data on the structure of
      atoms, which consist of corpuscles (electrons) charged with
      negative electricity, and notes the similarities in the results
      of various experiments and calculations on the size of
      molecules: the “first approximation” gives a
      diameter of about 100 millimicrons (millionths of a
      millimetre). Omitting Rücker’s particular remarks and
      his criticism of
neo-vitalism,[3] we quote his conclusions:
    

      “Those who belittle the ideas which have of late governed
      the advance of scientific theory, too often assume that there is
      no alternative between the opposing assertions that atoms and
      the ether are mere figments of the scientific imagination, and
      that, on the other hand, a mechanical theory of the atoms and
      the ether, which is now confessedly imperfect, would, if it
      could be perfected, give us a full and adequate representation
      of the underlying realities. For my part I believe that there is
      a via media.” A man in a dark room may discern
      objects dimly, but if he does not stumble over the furniture and
      does not walk into a looking-glass instead of through a door, it
      means that he sees some things correctly. There is no need,
      therefore, either to renounce the claim to penetrate below the
      surface of nature, or to claim that we have already fully
      unveiled the mystery of the world around us. “It may be
      granted that we have not yet framed a consistent image either of
      the nature of the atoms or of the ether in which they exist, but
      I have tried to show that in spite of the tentative nature of
      some of our theories, in spite of many outstanding difficulties,
      the atomic theory unifies so many facts, simplifies so much that
      is complicated, that we have a right to insist—at all
      events until an equally intelligible rival hypothesis is
      produced—that the main structure of our theory is true;
      that atoms are not merely aids to puzzled mathematicians, but
      physical realities.”
    

That is how Rücker ended his address. The reader will see
      that the speaker did not deal with epistemology, but as a matter
      of fact, doubtless in the name of a host of scientists, he was
      essentially expounding an instinctive materialist
      standpoint. The gist of his position is this: The theory

    

of
      physics is a copy (becoming ever more exact) of objective
      reality. The world is matter in motion, our knowledge of which
      grows ever more profound. The inaccuracies of
      Rücker’s philosophy are due to an unnecessary defence
      of the “mechanical” (why not electromagnetic?)
      theory of ether motions and to a failure to understand the
      relation between relative and absolute truth. This physicist
      lacks only a knowledge of dialectical
      materialism (if we do not count, of course, those very important
      social considerations which induce English professors to call
      themselves “agnostics").
    

Let us now see how the spiritualist James Ward criticised I this
      philosophy: “Naturalism is not science, and the mechanical
      theory of Nature, the theory which serves as its foundation, is
      no science either. . . . Nevertheless, though Naturalism and the
      natural sciences, the Mechanical Theory of the Universe and
      mechanics as a science are logically distinct, yet the two are
      at first sight very similar and historically are very closely
      connected. Between the natural sciences and philosophies of the
      idealist (or spiritualist) type there is indeed no danger of
      confusion, for all such philosophies necessarily involve
      criticism of the epistemological assumptions which science
      unconsciously
makes.”[2]

True! The natural sciences
      unconsciously assume that their teachings reflect
      objective reality, and only such a philosophy is
      reconcilable with the natural sciences! “. . . Not so with
      Naturalism, which is as innocent of any theory of knowledge as
      science itself. In fact Naturalism, like Materialism, is only
      physics treated as metaphysics. . . . Naturalism is less
      dogmatic than Materialism, no doubt, owing to its agnostic
      reservation as to the nature of ultimate reality; but it insists
      emphatically on the priority of the material aspect of its
      Unknowable.”
    

The materialist treats physics as metaphysics! A familiar
      argument. By metaphysics is meant the recognition of an
      objective reality outside man. The spiritualists agree with the
      Kantians and Humeans in such reproaches against
      materialism. This is understandable; for without doing away with
      the objective reality of things, bodies and objects

    

known to everyone, it is impossible to clear the road for
      “real conceptions” in Rehmke’s sense! . . .
    

      “When the essentially philosophical question, how best to
      systematise experience as a whole [a plagiarism from Bogdanov,
      Mr. Ward!], arises, the naturalist . . . contends that we must
      begin from the physical side. Then only are the facts precise,
      determinate, and rigorously concatenated: every thought that
      ever stirred the human heart . . . can, it holds, be traced to a
      perfectly definite redistribution of matter and
      motion. . . . That propositions of such philosophic generality
      and scope are legitimate deductions from physical science, few,
      if any, of our modern physicists are bold enough directly to
      maintain. But many of them consider that their science itself is
      attacked by those who seek to lay bare the latent metaphysics,
      the physical realism, on which the Mechanical Theory of the
      Universe rests. . . . The criticism of this theory in the
      preceding lectures has been so regarded [by
      Rücker]. . . . In point of fact my criticism

[of this “metaphysics,” so detested by all the Machians too]

rests throughout on the expositions
      of a school of physicists—if one might call them
      so—steadily increasing in number and influence, who reject
      entirely the almost medieval realism. . . . This realism has
      remained so long unquestioned, that to challenge it now seems to
      many to spell scientific anarchy. And yet it surely verges on
      extravagance to suppose that men like Kirchhoff or
      Poincaré—to mention only two out of many
      distinguished names—who do challenge it, are seeking
      ‘to invalidate the methods of science.’ . . . To
      distinguish them from the old school, whom we may fairly term
      physical realists, we might call the new school physical
      symbolists. The term is not very happy, but it may at least
      serve to emphasise the one difference between the two which now
      specially concerns us. The question at issue is very
      simple. Both schools start, of course, from the same perceptual
      experiences; both employ an abstract conceptual system,
      differing in detail but essentially the same; both resort to the
      same methods of verification. But the one believes that it is
      getting nearer to the ultimate reality and leaving mere
      appearances behind it; the other believes that it is only
      substituting a generalised descriptive scheme that is
      intellectually manageable, for the complexity of concrete

    

facts. . . . In either view the value of physics as systematic
      knowledge about [Ward’s italics] things is
      unaffected; its possibilities of future extension and of
      practical application are in either case the same. But the
      speculative difference between the two is immense, and in this
      respect the question which is right becomes important.”
    

The question is put by this frank and consistent spiritualist
      with remarkable truth and clarity. Indeed, the difference
      between the two schools in modern physics is only
      philosophical, only epistemological. Indeed, the basic
      distinction is only that one recognises the
      “ultimate” (he should have said objective) reality
      reflected by our theory, while the other denies it, regarding
      theory as only a systematisation of experience, a system of
      empirio-symbols, and so on and so forth. The new physics, having
      found new aspects of matter and new forms of its motion, raised
      the old philosophical questions because of the collapse of the
      old physical concepts. And if the people belonging to
      “intermediate” philosophical trends
      ("positivists,” Humeans, Machians) are unable to put the
      question at issue distinctly, it remained for the outspoken
      idealist Ward to tear off all veils.
    

      “. . . Sir A. W. Rücker . . . devoted his Inaugural
      Address to a defence of physical realism against the symbolic
      inter pretations recently advocated by Professors Poincaré
      and Poynting and by myself” (pp. 305-06; and in other
      parts of his book Ward adds to this list the names of Duhem,
      Pearson and Mach; see Vol. II, pp. 161, 63, 57, 75, 83, etc.).
    

      “. . . He [Rücker] is constantly talking of
      ‘mental pictures,’ while constantly protesting that
      atoms and ether must be more than these. Such procedure
      practically amounts to saying: In this case I can form no other
      picture, and therefore the reality must be like it. . . . He
      [Rücker] is fair enough to allow the abstract possibility
      of a different mental picture. . . . Nay, he allows ‘the
      tentative nature of some of our theories’; he admits
      ‘many outstanding difficulties.’ After all, then, he
      is only defending a working hypothesis, and one, moreover, that
      has lost greatly in prestige in the last half century. But if
      the atomic and other theories of the constitution of matter are
      but working hypotheses, and hypotheses strictly confined to
      physical phenomena, there is

    

no justification for a theory which
      maintains that mechanism is fundamental everywhere and reduces
      the facts of life and mind to epiphenomena—makes them,
      that is to say, a degree more phenomenal, a degree less real
      than matter and motion. Such is the mechanical theory of the
      universe. Save as he seems unwittingly to countenance that, we
      have then no quarrel with Sir Arthur Rücker”
      (pp. 314-15).
    

It is, of course, utterly absurd to say that materialism ever
      maintained that consciousness is “less” real, or
      necessarily professed a “mechanical,” and not an
      electromagnetic, or some other, immeasurably more complex,
      picture of the world of moving matter. But in a truly
      adroit manner, much more skilfully than our Machians
      (i.e., muddled idealists), the outspoken and
      straightforward idealist Ward seizes upon the weak
      points in “instinctive” natural-historical
      materialism, as, for instance, its inability to explain the
      relation of relative and absolute truth. Ward turns somersaults
      and declares that since truth is relative, approximate, only
      “tentative,” it cannot reflect reality! But, on the
      other hand, the question of atoms, etc., as “a working
      hypothesis” is very correctly put by the
      spiritualist. Modern, cultured fideism (which Ward directly
      deduces from his spiritualism) does not think of
      demanding anything more than the declaration that the
      concepts of natural science are “working
      hypotheses.” We will, sirs, surrender science to you
      scientists provided you surrender epistemology, philosophy to
      us—such is the condition for the cohabitation of the
      theologians and professors in the “advanced”
      capitalist countries.
    

Among the other points on which Ward connects his epistemology
      with the “new” physics must be counted his deter
      mined attack on matter. What is matter and what is
      energy?—asks Ward, mocking at the plethora of hypotheses
      and their contradictoriness. Is it ether or ethers?—or,
      perhaps, some new “perfect fluid,” arbitrarily
      endowed with new and improbable qualities? And Ward’s
      conclusion is: “ . . . we find nothing definite except
      movement left. Heat is a mode of motion, elasticity is a mode of
      motion, light and magnetism are modes of motion. Nay, mass
      itself is, in the end, supposed to be but a mode of motion of a
      something that is neither solid, nor liquid nor gas, that is
      neither

    

itself a body nor an aggregate of bodies, that is not
      phenomenal and must not be noumenal, a veritable apeiron

[a term used by the Greek philosophers signifying:
      infinite, boundless]

on which we can impose our own
      terms” (Vol. I, p. 140).
    

The spiritualist is true to himself when he divorces motion from
      matter. The movement of bodies is transformed in nature into a
      movement of something that is not a body with a constant mass,
      into a movement of an unknown charge of an unknown electricity
      in an unknown ether—this dialectics of material
      transformation, performed in the laboratory and in the factory,
      serves in the eyes of the idealist (as in the eyes of the public
      at large, and of the Machians) not as a confirmation of
      materialist dialectics, but as evidence against materialism:
      “ . . . The mechanical theory, as a professed explanation
      of the world, receives its death-blow from the progress of
      mechanical physics itself” (p. 143). The world is matter
      in motion, we reply, and the laws of its motion are reflected by
      mechanics in the case of moderate velocities and by the
      electromagnetic theory in the case of great
      velocities. “Extended, solid, indestructible atoms have
      always been the stronghold of materialistic views of the
      universe. But, unhappily for such views, the hard, extended atom
      was not equal to the demands which increasing knowledge made
      upon it” (p. 144). The destructibility of the atom, its
      inexhaustibility, the mutability of all forms of matter and of
      its motion, have always been the stronghold of dialectical
      materialism. All boundaries in nature are conditional, relative,
      movable, and express the gradual approximation of our mind
      towards the knowledge of matter. But this does not in any way
      prove that nature, matter itself, is a symbol, a conventional
      sign, i.e., the product of our mind. The electron is to
      the atom as a full stop in this book is to the size of a
      building 200 feet long, 100 feet broad, and 50 feet high
      (Lodge); it moves with a velocity as high as 270,000 kilometres
      per second; its mass is a function of its velocity; it makes 500
      trillion revolutions in a second—all this is much more
      complicated than the old mechanics; but it is, nevertheless,
      movement of matter in space and time. Human reason has
      discovered many amazing things in nature and will discover still
      more, and will thereby

    

increase its power over nature. But this
      does not mean that nature is the creation of our mind or of
      abstract mind, i.e., of Ward’s God,
      Bogdanov’s “substitution,” etc.
    

      “Rigorously carried out as a theory of the real world,
      that ideal [i.e., the ideal of “mechanism"] lands
      us in nihilism: all changes are motions, for motions are the
      only changes we can understand, and so what moves, to be
      understood, must itself be motion” (p. 166). “As I
      have tried to show, and as I believe, the very advance of
      physics is proving the most effectual cure for this ignorant
      faith in matter and motion as the inmost substance rather than
      the most abstract symbols of the sum of existence. . . . We can
      never get to God through a mere mechanism” (p. 180).
    

Well, well, this is exactly in the spirit of the
      Studies “in” the Philosophy of
      Marxism ! Mr. Ward, you ought to address yourself to
      Lunacharsky, Yushkevich, Bazarov and Bogdanov. They are a little
      more “shamefaced” than you are, but they preach the
      same doctrine.

Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Five: The Recent Revolution in Natural Science and Philosophical Idealism )
5. The Two Trends in Modern Physics, and
German Idealism

In 1896, the well-known Kantian idealist Hermann Cohen, with
      unusually triumphant exultation, wrote an introduction to the
      fifth edition of the Geschichte des Materialismus, the
      falsified history of materialism written by F. Albert
      Lange. “Theoretical idealism,” exclaims Cohen
      (p. xxvi), “has already begun to shake the materialism of
      the natural scientists, and perhaps in only a little while will
      defeat it completely.” Idealism is permeating
      (Durchwirkung) the new physics. “Atomism must
      give place to dynamism. . . .” “It is a remarkable
      turn of affairs that research into the chemical problem of
      substance should have led to a fundamental triumph over the
      materialist view of matter. Just as Thales performed the first
      abstraction of the idea of substance, and linked it with
      speculations on the electron, so the theory of electricity was
      destined to cause the greatest revolution in the conception of
      matter and, through the transformation of matter into force,
      bring about the victory of idealism” (p. xxix).
    
 

Hermann Cohen is as clear and definite as James Ward in pointing
      out the fundamental philosophical trends, and does not
      lose himself (as our Machians do) in petty distinctions between
      this and that energeticist, symbolist, empirio-criticist,
      empirio-monist idealism, and so forth. Cohen takes the
      fundamental philosophical trend of the school of
      physics that is now associated with the names of Mach,
      Poincaré and others and correctly describes this trend as
      idealist. “The transformation of matter into
      force” is here for Cohen the most important triumph of
      idealism, just as it was for the “ghost-seeing”
      scientists—whom J. Dietzgen exposed in 1869. Electricity
      is proclaimed a collaborator of idealism, because it has
      destroyed the old theory of the structure of matter, shattered
      the atom and discovered new forms of material motion, so unlike
      the old, so totally uninvestigated and unstudied, so unusual and
      “miraculous,” that it permits nature to be presented
      as non-material (spiritual, mental, psychical)
      motion. Yesterday’s limit to our knowledge of the
      infinitesimal particles of matter has disappeared,
      hence—concludes the idealist philosopher—matter has
      disappeared (but thought remains). Every physicist and every
      engineer knows that electricity is (material) motion, but nobody
      knows clearly what is moving, hence—concludes the
      idealist philosopher—we can dupe the philosophically
      uneducated with the seductively “economical”
      proposition: let us conceive motion without
      matter. . . .
    

Hermann Cohen tries to enlist the famous physicist Heinrich
      Hertz as llis ally. Hertz is ours—he is a Kantian, we
      sometimes find him admitting the a priori, he
      says. Hertz is ours, he is a Machian—contends the Machian
      Kleinpeter—for in Hertz we have glimpses of “the
      same subjectivist view of the nature of our concepts as in the
      case of
Mach.”[1]

      This strange dispute as to where Hertz belongs is a
      good example of how the idealist philosophers seize on the
      minutest error, the slightest vagueness of expression on the
      part of renowned scientists in order to justify their
      refurbished defence of fideism. As a matter of fact,
      Hertz’s philosophical preface

    

to his
Mechanik[2]

displays the
      usual standpoint of the scientist who has been intimidated by
      the professorial hue and cry against the
      “metaphysics” of materialism, but who nevertheless
      cannot overcome his instinctive conviction of the reality of the
      external world. This has been acknowledged by Kleinpeter
      himself, who on the one hand casts to the mass of readers
      thoroughly false popularly-written pamphlets on the theory of
      knowledge of natural science, in which Mach figures
      side by side with Hertz, while on the other, in specifically
      philosophical articles, he admits that “Hertz, as opposed
      to Mach and Pearson, still clings to the prejudice that all
      physics can be explained in a mechanistic
way,”[3]

that he retains the concept of the thing-in-itself and
      “the usual standpoint of the physicists,” and that
      Hertz still adheres to “a picture of the universe in
      itself,” and so
on.[4]


It is interesting to note Hertz’s view of energetics. He
      writes: “If we inquire into the real reason why physics at
      the present time prefers to express itself in terms of
      energetics, we may answer that it is because in this way it best
      avoids talking about things of which it knows very
      little. . . . Of course, we are now convinced that ponderable
      matter consists of atoms; and in certain cases we have fairly
      definite ideas of the magnitude of these atoms and of their
      motions. But the form of the atoms, their connection, their
      motions in most cases, all these are entirely hidden from
      us. . . . So that our conception of atoms is therefore in itself
      an important and interesting object for further investigations,
      but is not particularly adapted to serve as a known and secure
      foundation for mathematical theories” (op. cit., Vol. III,
      p. 21). Hertz expected that further study of the ether would
      provide an explanation of the “nature of traditional
      matter . . . its inertia and gravitational force” (Vol. I,
      p. 354).
    

It is evident from this that the possibility of a
      non-materialist view of energy did not even occur to
      Hertz. Energetics served the philosophers as an excuse to desert
      materialism

    

for idealism. The scientist regards energetics as a
      convenient method of expressing the laws of material motion at a
      period when, if we may so express it, physicists had left the
      atom but had not yet arrived at the electron. This period is to
      a large extent not yet at an end; one hypothesis yields place to
      another; nothing whatever is known of the positive electron;
      only three months ago (June 22, 1908), Jean Becquerel reported
      to the French Academy of Science that he had succeeded in
      discovering this “new component part of matter”
      (Comptes rendus des séances de l’Académie
      des Sciences, p. 1311). How could idealist philosophy
      refrain from taking advantage of such an opportunity, when
      “matter” was still being “sought” by the
      human mind and was therefore no more than a
      “symbol,” etc.
    

Another German idealist, one far more reactionary than Cohen,
      Eduard von Hartmann, devoted a whole book to the world outlook
      of modern physics (Die Weltanschauung der modernen
      Physik, Leipzig, 1902). We are, of course, not interested
      in the specific arguments of the author in favour of his own
      variety of idealism. For us it is important only to point out
      that this idealist notes the same phenomena as Rey, Ward and
      Cohen. “Modern physics had grown up on a realist
      basis,” says Hartmann, “and it was only the
      Neo-Kantian and agnostic movement of our own time that led it to
      re-interpret its data in an idealist spirit”
      (p. 218). According to Hartmann, three epistemological systems
      constitute the basis of modern physics—hylo-kinetics (from
      the Greek hyle—matter, and
      kinesis—motion—i.e., the
      recognition of physical phenomena as matter in motion),
      energetics, and dynamism (i.e., the recognition of
      force without substance). Of course, the idealist Hartmann
      favours “dynamism,” from which he draws the
      conclusion that the laws of nature are world-thought, in a word,
      he “substitutes” the psychical for physical
      nature. But he is forced to admit that hylo-kinetics has the
      majority of physicists on its side, that it is the system that
      “is most frequently employed” (p. 190), that its
      serious defect is “materialism and atheism, which threaten
      from pure hylo-kinetics” (p. 189). This author quite
      justly regards energetics as an intermediary system and calls it
      agnosticism (p. 136). Of course,

    

it is an “ally of pure
      dynamism, for it dethrones substance” (pp. vi, 192), but
      Hartmann dislikes its agnosticism as a form of
      “Anglomania,” which is incompatible with the genuine
      idealism of a true-German reactionary.
    

It is highly instructive to see how this irreconcilable partisan
      idealist (non-partisans in philosophy are just as hopelessly
      thick-headed as they are in politics) explains to the physicists
      what it means to follow one epistemological trend or
      another. “Only a very few of the physicists who follow
      this fashion,” writes Hartmann in reference to the
      idealist interpretation of the latest results in physics,
      “realise the full scope and implications of such an
      interpretation. They have failed to observe that physics with
      its specific laws has retained significance only in so far as,
      despite its idealism, it has adhered to realistic basic
      propositions, viz., the existence of
      things-in-themselves, their real mutability in time, real
      causality. . . . Only by granting these realistic premises (the
      transcendental validity of causality, time and three-dimensional
      space), i.e., only on the condition that nature, of
      whose laws physics speaks, coincides with a . . . realm of
      things-in themselves, can one speak of natural laws as distinct
      from psychological laws. Only if natural laws operate in a realm
      independent of our mind can they serve as an explanation of the
      fact that the logically necessary effects of our images are
      always images of the natural-historically necessary effects of
      the unknown which they reflect or symbolise in our
      consciousness” (pp. 218-19).
    

Hartmann rightly feels that the idealism of the new physics is
      nothing but a fashion, and not a serious philosophical
      turn away from natural-historical materialism; and he,
      therefore, correctly explains to the physicists that in order to
      transform the “fashion” into consistent, integral
      philosophical idealism it is necessary radically to modify the
      doctrine of the objective reality of time, space, causality and
      natural law. We cannot regard only atoms, electrons and ether as
      mere symbols, as a mere “working hypothesis": time, space,
      the laws of nature and the whole external world must also be
      proclaimed a “working hypothesis.” Either
      materialism, or the universal substitution of the psychical for
      the whole of physical nature; those

    

anxious to confound the two
      are legion, but we and Bogdanov are not of their number.
    

Among the German physicists, Ludwig Boltzmann, who died in 1906,
      systematically combated the Machian tendency. We have already
      pointed out that as against those who were “carried away
      by the new epistemological dogmas” he simply and clearly
      reduced Machism to solipsism (see above, Chap. I, §
      6). Boltzmann, of course, was afraid to call himself a
      materialist and even explicitly stated that he did not deny the
      existence of
God.[5]

      But his theory of knowledge is essentially materialistic, and
      expresses—as is admitted by
S. Günther,[6]

the historian of natural science
      in the nineteenth century—the views of the majority of
      scientists. “We know,” says Boltzmann, “of the
      existence of all things solely from the impressions they make on
      our senses” (op. cit., p. 29). Theory is an
      “image” (or copy) of nature, of the external world
      (p. 77). To those who say that matter is only a complex of
      sense-perceptions, Boltzmann points out that in that case other
      people are only the sensations of the speaker (p. 168). These
      “ideologues,” as Boltzmann sometimes calls the
      philosophical idealists, present us with a “subjective
      picture of the world” (p. 176), whereas the author prefers
      a “simpler objective picture of the world.”
      “The idealist compares the assertion that matter exists as
      well as our sensations with the child’s opinion that a
      stone which is beaten experiences pain. The realist compares the
      assertion that one cannot conceive how the mental can be formed
      from the material, or even from the play of atoms, with the
      opinion of an uneducated person who asserts that the distance
      between the sun and the earth cannot be twenty million miles,
      for he cannot conceive it” (p. 186). Boltzmann does not
      deny that the ideal of science is to present mind and volition
      as “complex actions of particles of matter”
      (p. 396).
    

L. Boltzmann frequently polemicised against Ostwald’s
      energetics from the standpoint of a physicist, and argued that
      Ostwald could neither disprove nor eliminate the formula

    

of
      kinetic energy (half the mass multiplied by the square of
      velocity) and that he was revolving in a vicious circle by first
      deducing energy from mass (by accepting the formula of kinetic
      energy) and then defining mass as energy (pp. 112, 139). This
      reminds me of Bogdanov’s paraphrase of Mach in the third
      book of his Empirio-Monism. “In science,”
      writes Bogdanov in reference to Mach’s
      Mechanik,[111] “the concept matter is reduced to
      the coefficient of mass as it appears in the equations of
      mechanics, upon accurate analysis, how ever, the coefficient of
      mass proves to be the reciprocal of the acceleration when two
      physical body-complexes interact” (p. 146). It is evident
      that if a certain body is taken as a unit, the motion
      (mechanical) of all other bodies can be expressed as a mere
      relation of acceleration. But this does not at all mean that
      “bodies” (i.e., matter) disappear or cease
      to exist independently of our mind. When the whole world is
      reduced to the movement of electrons, it will be possible to
      eliminate the electron from all equations, because it will be
      everywhere assumed, and the correlation between groups or
      aggregates of electrons will reduce itself to their mutual
      acceleration, if the forms of motion prove to be as simple as
      those of mechanics.
    

Combating the “phenomenalist” physics of Mach and
      Co., Boltzmann maintained that “those who believe atomism
      to have been eliminated by differential equations, cannot see
      the wood for the trees” (p. 144). “If we do not wish
      to entertain illusions as to the significance of a differential
      equation . . . we cannot doubt that this picture of the world
      (expressed in differential equations) must again by its nature
      be an atomic one, i.e., an instruction that the changes
      in time of a vast quantity of things arranged in
      three-dimensional space must be thought of in accordance with
      definite rules. The things can, of course, be similar or
      dissimilar, unchangeable or changeable,”
      etc. (p. 156). “If we are perfectly clear,” said
      Boltzmann in an address delivered to the Congress of Scientists
      held in Munich in 1899, “that the phenomenalists cloaked
      in differential equations likewise base themselves on atom-like
      discrete units (Einzelwesen) which they have to picture
      as possessing now certain properties now others for each group
      of phenomena, the need for a simplified, uniform atomism will
      soon again be felt” (p. 223).

    

The electron theory
      “is developing into an atomic theory of electricity as a
      whole” (p. 357). The unity of nature is revealed in the
      “astonishing analogy” between the differential
      equations of the various realms of phenomena. “The same
      equations can be regarded as solving the problems of
      hydro-dynamics and of the theory of potentials. The theory of
      vortices in fluids and the theory of friction in gases
      (Gasreibung) reveal a most astonishing analogy to the
      theory of electromagnetism, etc.” (p. 7). Those who accept
      “the theory of universal substitution” cannot escape
      the question: Who was it that thought of
      “substituting” physical nature so uniformly?
    

As if in answer to those who brush aside “the physicist of
      the old school,” Boltzmann relates in detail how certain
      specialists in “physical chemistry” are adopting an
      epistemological position contrary to that of Machism. Vaubel,
      the author of “one of the best” comprehensive works
      of 1903 (according to Boltzmann), “takes up a definitely
      hostile attitude towards the so-called phenomenalism so often
      recommended today” (p. 381). “He tries rather to
      obtain as concrete and clear an idea as possible of the nature
      of atoms and molecules and of the forces and agencies acting
      between them, and this idea he attempts to bring into conformity
      with the most recent experiments in this field [ions, electrons,
      radium, Zeeman effect, etc.]. . . . The author strictly adheres
      to the dualism of matter and
energy,[7]

which have this in common that
      each has a special law of conservation. In regard to matter, the
      author also holds fast to the dualism between ponderable matter
      and ether, yet regards the latter as material in the strictest
      sense” (p. 381). In the second volume of his work (theory
      of electricity) the author “from the very outset takes the
      view that the phenomena of electricity are determined by the
      interaction and movement of atom-like entities, the
      electrons” (p. 383).
    

Hence, we find that what the spiritualist James Ward admitted to
      be true of England applies also to Germany, namely, that the
      physicists of the realistic school systematise

    

the facts and
      discoveries of recent years no less successfully than the
      physicists of the symbolist school and that the essential
      difference between them consists “only” in
      their epistemological points of
view.[8]

Boltzmann wishes to say that the author does not
      attempt to conceive motion without matter. To speak of dualism
      here is ridiculous. Philosophical monism and dualism consist
      respectively in a consistent or inconsistent adherence to
      materialism or idealism.

The
      work of Erich Becher, Philosophical Premises of the Exact
      Sciences (Philosophische Votaussetzungen der exakten
      Naturwissenschaften, Leipzig, 1907), with which I became
      acquainted only after my book had been completed, confirms what
      has been said in this paragraph. Holdin, closest of all to the
      epistemological point of view of Helmholtz and Boltzmann, that
      is, to a “shamefaced” and incompletely thought-out
      materialism, the author devotes his work to a defence and
      interpretation of the fundamental premises of physics and
      chemistry. This defence naturally becomes converted into a fight
      against the fashionable but increasingly-resisted Machian trend
      in physics (cf. p. 91, etc.). E. Becher correctly
      characterises this tendency as “subjective
      positivism” (p. iii) and reduces the central point
      of his objection to it to a proof of the
      “hypothesis” of the external world (Chapters
      II-VII), to a proof of its “existence independently of
      human perceptions” (vom Wahrgenommenawerden
      unabhängige Existenz). The denial of this
      “hypothesis” by the Machians frequently leads the
      latter to solipsism (pp. 78-82,
      etc.). “Mach’s view that sensations and
      complexes of sensations, and not the external world”
      (p. 138), are the only subject matter of science, Becher calls
      “sensationalist monism”
      (Empfindungsmonismus) and classes it with the
      “purely conscientialistic tendencies.” This clumsy
      and absurd term is constructed from the Latin word
      conscientia—consciousness, and means nothing but
      philosophical idealism (cf. p. 156). In the last two
      chapters of the book E. Becher quite skilfully compares the old
      mechanical theory with the new electrical theory of matter and
      world-picture (the “kinetico-elastic,” as the author
      puts it, with the “kinetico-electric” conception of
      nature). The latter theory, based on the electron theory, is a
      step forward in knowledge of the unity of the world;
      according to this theory the “elements of the material
      world are electrical charges” (Ladungen,
      p. 223). “Every purely kinetic conception of nature knows
      nothing save a certain number of moving objects, whether they
      are called electrons or something else. The state of motion of
      these objects in successive time intervals is consistently
      determined by their position and state of motion in the
      preceding time interval” (p. 225). The chief defect of
      Becher’s book is his absolute ignorance of dialectical
      materialism. This ignorance frequently leads him into confusion
      and absurdity, on which it is impossible to dwell here.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Five: The Recent Revolution in Natural Science and Philosophical Idealism )
6. The Two Trends in Modern Physics and
French Fideism

In France, idealist philosophy has seized upon the vacillations
      of Machian physics with no less determination. We have already
      seen how the neo-criticists greeted Mach’s

    

Mechanik and how they immediately discerned the
      idealist character of the principles of Mach’s
      philosophy. The French Machian, Henri Poincaré, was even
      more successful in this respect. The most reactionary idealist
      philosophy, the implications of which were definitely fideistic,
      immediately seized upon his theory. An adherent of this
      philosophy, Le Roy, argued thus: the truths of science are
      conventional signs, symbols; you have abandoned the absurd,
      “metaphysical” claims to knowledge of objective
      reality—well then, be logical and agree with us that
      science has practical significance only for one sphere of human
      activity and that religion has a no less real
      significance for another sphere of activity;
      “symbolic,” Machian science has no right to deny
      theology. H. Poincaré was abashed by these conclusions and
      in his book La valeur de la science made a special
      attack on them. But just see what epistemological
      position he was obliged to adopt in order to rid himself of
      allies of the type of Le Roy. He writes: “M. Le Roy
      regards the intellect as incurably impotent only in order to
      give greater place to other sources of knowledge, for instance,
      the heart, sentiment, instinct and faith”
      (pp. 214-15). “I do not go to the limit,” he
      says. Scientific laws are conventions, symbols, but “if
      scientific ‘recipes’ have a value as rules of
      action, it is because we know that, in general at least, they
      are successful. But to know this is already to know something;
      and if so, how can you say that we can know nothing?”
      (p. 219).
    

H. Poincaré resorts to the criterion of practice. But he
      only shifts the question without settling it; for this criterion
      may be interpreted in a subjective as well as in an objective
      way. Le Roy also admits this criterion for science and industry;
      all he denies is that this criterion proves objective
      truth, for such a denial suffices him for admitting the
      subjective truth of religion along with the subjective truth of
      science (i.e., as not existing apart from
      mankind). Poincaré realises that one cannot limit oneself
      to a reference to practice in arguing against Le Roy, and he
      passes to the question of the objectivity of
      science. “What is the criterion of its objectivity? Well,
      it is exactly the same as the criterion of our belief in
      external objects. These objects are real in as much as the
      sensations

    

they evoke in us (qu’ils nous
      fontéprouver) appear to be united by some sort of
      indestructible cement and not by an ephemeral accident”
      (pp. 269-70).
    

The author of such a remark may well be a great
      physicist, but it is absolutely indisputable that only
      the Voroshilov-Yushkeviches can take him seriously as a
      philosopher. Materialism is declared to have been destroyed by a
      “theory” which at the first onslaught of fideism
      takes refuge under the wing of materialism ! For it is
      the purest materialism to say that sensations are evoked in us
      by real objects and that “belief” in the objectivity
      of science is the same as “belief” in the objective
      existence of external objects.
    

      “. . . It can be said, for instance, that ether has no
      less reality than any external body” (p. 270).
    

What an outcry our Machians would have raised had a materialist
      said that! How many feeble witticisms would have been uttered at
      the expense of “ethereal materialism,” and so
      forth. But five pages later the founder of recent
      empirio-symbolism declares: “Everything that is not
      thought is pure nothing, since we can think nothing but
      thought” (p. 276). You are mistaken, M. Poincaré your
      works prove that there are people who can only think what is
      entirely devoid of thought. To this class of people belongs the
      notorious muddler, Georges Sorel, who maintains that the
      “first two parts” of Poincaré’s book on
      the value of science are written in the “spirit of Le
      Roy” and that therefore the two philosophers can be
      “reconciled” as follows: the attempt to establish an
      identity between science and the world is an illusion; there is
      no need to raise the question whether science can have knowledge
      of nature or not, for it is sufficient that science should
      correspond with the mechanisms created by us (Georges Sorel,
      Les préoccupations metaphysiques des physiciens
      modernes [Metaphysical Preoccupations of the Modern
      Physicists], Paris, 1907, pp. 77, 80, 81).
    

But while it is sufficient merely to mention the
      “philosophy” of Poincaré and pass on, it is
      imperative to dwell at some length on the work of A. Rey. We
      have already pointed out that the two basic trends in modern
      physics, which Rey calls the “conceptualist” and the
      “neo-mechanistic,” reduce themselves to the
      difference between the idealist and the materialist
      epistemologies. We must now see how the positivist Rey solves a
      problem which is diametrically opposed

    

to that broached by the
      spiritualist James Ward and the idealists Cohen and Hartmann,
      the problem, namely, not of seizing upon the philosophical
      mistakes of the new physics, its leanings towards idealism, but
      of rectifying these mistakes and of proving the illegitimacy of
      the idealist (and fideist) conclusions drawn from the new
      physics.
    

A thread that runs through the whole of Rey’s work is the
      recognition of the fact that the new physical theory of the
      “conceptualists” (Machians) has been seized upon by
      fideism (pp. 11, 17, 220, 362, etc.) and
      “philosophical idealism” (p. 200),
      scepticism as to the rights of the intellect and the rights of
      science (pp. 210, 220), subjectivism (p. 311), and so
      forth. Therefore, Rey quite rightly makes the analysis of the
      “opinions of the physicists on the objective validity of
      physics” (p. 3) the centre of his work.
    

And what are the results of this analysis?
    

Let us take the basic concept, the concept of experience. Rey
      assures us that Mach’s subjectivist interpretation (for
      the sake of simplicity and brevity we shall take Mach as the
      representative of the school which Rey terms conceptualist) is a
      sheer misunderstanding. It is true that one of the
      “outstanding new features of the philosophy of the end of
      the nineteenth century” is that “empiricism,
      becoming ever subtler and richer in nuances, leads to fideism,
      to the supremacy of faith—this same empiricism that was
      once the great war engine of scepticism against the assertions
      of metaphysics. Has not at bottom the real meaning of the word
      ‘experience’ been distorted, little by little, by
      imperceptible nuances? Experience, when returned to the
      conditions of existence, to that experimental science which
      renders it exact and refined, leads us to necessity and to
      truth” (p. 398). There is no doubt that all Machism, in
      the broad sense of the term, is nothing but a distortion, by
      means of imperceptible nuances, of the real meaning of the word
      “experience"! But how does Rey, who accuses only the
      fideists of distortion, but not Mach himself, correct this
      distortion? Listen. “Experience is by definition a
      knowledge of the object. In physical science this definition is
      more in place than anywhere else. . . . Experience is that over
      which our mind has no command, that which our desires, our
      volition, cannot control, that which is given and which

    

is not
      of our own making. Experience is the object that faces (en
      face du) the subject” (p. 314).
    

Here you have an example of how Rey defends Machism! What
      penetrating genius Engels revealed when he dubbed the latest
      type of adherents of philosophical agnosticism and phenomenalism
      “shamefaced materialists.” The positivist and ardent
      phenomenalist, Rey, is a superb specimen of this type. If
      experience is “knowledge of the object,” if
      “experience is the object that faces the subject,”
      if experience means that “something external (quelque
      chose du de hors) exists and necessarily exists”
      (se pose et en se posant s’impose—p. 324),
      this obviously amounts to materialism! Rey’s
      phenomenalism, his ardent and emphatic assertion that nothing
      exists save sensations, that the objective is that which is
      generally valid, etc., etc.—all this is only a fig-leaf,
      an empty verbal covering for materialism, since we are told:
    

      “The objective is that which is given from without, that
      which is imposed (imposé) by experience; it is
      that which is not of our making, but which is made independently
      of us and which to a certain extent makes us”
      (p. 320). Rey defends “conceptualism” by destroying
      conceptualism! The refutation of the idealist implications of
      Machism is achieved only by interpreting Machism after the
      manner of shame faced materialism. Having himself admitted the
      distinction between the two trends in modern physics, Rey toils
      in the sweat of his brow to obliterate all distinctions in the
      interests of the materialist trend. Rey says of the
      neo-mechanist school, for instance, that it does not admit the
      “least doubt, the least uncertainty” as to the
      objectivity of physics (p. 237): “Here

[in regard to the doctrines of this school]

      one feels remote from the detours one was obliged to make from
      the standpoint of the other theories of physics in order to
      arrive at the assertion of this objectivity.”
    

But it is such “detours” of Machism that Rey
      conceals by casting a veil over them in his exposition. The
      fundamental characteristic of materialism is that it starts
      from the objectivity of science, from the recognition of
      objective reality reflected by science, whereas idealism
      needs “detours” in order, in one way or
      another, to “deduce” objectivity from mind,
      consciousness, the “psychic.” “The
      neo-mechanist [i.e., the prevailing] school in
      physics,” says

    

Rey, “believes in the
      reality of the physical theory just as humanity
      believes in the reality of the external world”
      (p. 234, § 22: Thesis). For this school “theory aims
      at being a copy (le décalque) of the object”
      (p. 235).
    

True. And this fundamental trait of the
      “neo-mechanist” school is nothing but the basis of
      materialist epistemology. No attempts of Rey to
      dissociate himself from the materialists or to assure us that
      the neo-mechanists are also in essence phenomenalists, etc., can
      mitigate this basic fact. The essence of the difference between
      the neo-mechanists (materialists who are more or less
      shamefaced) and the Machians is that the latter depart
      from this theory of knowledge, and departing from it inevitably
      fall into fideism.
    

Take Rey’s attitude to Mach’s theory of causality
      and necessity in nature. Only at first glance, Rey assures us,
      does it appear that Mach is “approaching scepticism”
      and “subjectivism” (p. 76); this
      “ambiguity” (équivoque, p. 115)
      disappears if Mach’s teaching is taken as a whole. And Rey
      takes it as a whole, quotes a series of passages from the
      Wärmelehre [112] and the Analyse der
      Empfindungen, and specially deals with the chapter on
      causality in the former book, but . . . he takes care not to
      quote the decisive passage, Mach’s declaration
      that there is no physical necessity, but only logical
      necessity ! All that one can say of such a procedure is
      that it does not interpret Mach but adorns him, that it
      obliterates the differences between “neo-mechanism”
      and Machism. Rey’s conclusion is that “Mach adopts
      the analysis and conclusions of Hume, Mill and all the
      phenomenalists, according to whom the causal relation has no
      substantiality and is only a habit of thought. He has
      also adopted the fundamental thesis of phenomenalism, of which
      the doctrine of causality is only a consequence, namely, that
      nothing exists save sensations. But he adds, along a purely
      objectivist line, that science, analysing sensations, discovers
      in them certain permanent and common elements which, although
      abstracted from these sensations, have the same reality as the
      sensations themselves, for they are taken from sensations by
      means of perceptual observation. And these permanent and common
      elements, such as energy and its various forms, are the
      foundation for the systematisation of physics” (p. 117).
    
 

This means that Mach accepts Hume’s subjective theory of
      causality and interprets it in an objectivist sense! Rey is
      shirking the issue when he defends Mach by referring to his
      inconsistency, and by maintaining that in the “real”
      interpretation of experience the latter leads to
      “necessity.” Now, experience is what is given to us
      from without; and if the necessity of nature and its laws are
      also given to man from without, from an objectively real nature,
      then, of course, all difference between Machism and materialism
      vanishes. Rey defends Machism against the charge of
      “neo-mechanism” by capitulating to the latter all
      along the line, retaining the word phenomenalism but not the
      essence of that trend.
    

Poincaré, for instance, fully in the spirit of Mach,
      derives the laws of nature—including even the
      tri-dimensionality of space—from
      “convenience.” But this does not at all mean
      “arbitrary,” Rey hastens to “correct.”
      Oh no, “convenient” here expresses
      “adaptation to the object” (Rey’s
      italics, p. 196). What a superb differentiation between the two
      schools and what a superb “refutation” of
      materialism! “If Poincaré’s theory is logically
      separated by an impassable gulf from the ontological
      interpretation of the mechanist school

[i.e., from the latter’s acceptance
      of theory as a copy of the object]

. . . if
      Poincaré’s theory lends itself to the support of
      philosophical idealism, in the scientihc sphere, at least, it
      agrees very well with the general evolution of the ideas of
      classical physics and the tendency to regard physics as
      objective knowledge, as objective as experience, that is, as the
      sensations from which experience proceeds” (p. 200).
    

On the one hand, we cannot but admit; on the other hand, it must
      be confessed. On the one hand, an impassable gulf divides
      Poincaré from neo-mechanism, although Poincaré stands
      in between Mach’s “conceptualism” and
      neo-mechanism, while Mach, it would appear, is not separated by
      any gulf from neo-mechanism; on the other hand, Poincaré is
      quite compatible with classical physics which, according to Rey
      himself, completely accepts the standpoint of
      “mechanism.” On the one hand, Poincaré’s
      theory lends itself to the support of philosophical idealism; on
      the other hand, it is compatible with the objective
      interpretation of

    

the word



"experience".

On the one hand, these
      bad fideists have distorted the meaning of the word experience
      by imperceptible deviations, by departing from the correct view
      that “experience is the object"; on the other hand, the
      objectivity of experience means only that experience is
      sensation . . . with which both Berkeley and Fichte agree!
    

Rey got himself muddled because he had set himself the
      impossible task of “reconciling” the opposition
      between the materialist and the idealist schools in the new
      physics. He seeks to tone down the materialism of the
      neo-mechanist school, attributing to phenomenalism the views of
      physicists who regard their theory as a copy of the
object.[1]
[1]
The “conciliator,” A. Rey, not only
      cast a veil over the formulation of the question at issue as
      made by philosophical materialism but also ignored the most
      clearly expressed materialistic declarations of the French
      physicists. He did not mention, for example, Alfred Cornu, who
      died in 1902. That physicist met the Ostwaldian
      “destruction [or conquest, Ueberwindung]
      of scientific materialism” with a contemptuous remark
      regarding pretentious journalistic treatment of the question
      (see Revue générele des sciences, 1895,
      pp. 1030-31). At the international congress of physicists held
      in Paris in 1900, Cornu said: “ . . . The deeper we
      penetrate into the knowledge of natural phenomena, the more does
      the bold Cartesian conception of the mechanism of the universe
      unfold and define itself, namely, that in the physical world
      there is nothing save matter and motion. The problem of the
      unity of physical forces . . . has again come to the fore after
      the great discoveries which marked the end of this century. Also
      the constant concern of our modern leaders, Faraday, Maxwell,
      Hertz (to mention only the illustrious dead), was to define
      nature more accurately and to unravel the properties of this
      elusive matter (matière subtile), the receptacle
      of world energy. . . . The reversion to Cartesian ideas is
      obvious. . . .” (Rapports présentés au
      congrès international de physique [Reports Made at the
      International Physics Congress], Paris, 1900, t. 4-me,
      p. 7.) Lucien Poincaré, in his book Modern
      Physics, justly remarks that this Cartesian idea was taken
      up and developed by the Encyclopaedists of the eighteenth
      century (La physique moderne, Paris, 1906, p. 14). But
      neither this physicist nor A. Cornu knew that the dialectical
      materialists Marx and Engels had freed this fundamental premise
      of materialism from the one-sidedness of mechanistic
      materialism.
—Lenin


And he seeks to tone down the idealism of the
      conceptualist school by pruning away the more emphatic
      declarations of its adherents and interpreting the rest in the
      spirit of shamefaced materialism. How far-fetched and fictitious
      is Rey’s disavowal of materialism is shown, for example,
      by his opinion of the theoretical significance of the
      differential equations of Maxwell and Hertz. In the

    

opinion of
      the Machians, the fact that these physicists limit their theory
      to a system of equations refutes materialism: there are
      equations and nothing else—no matter, no objective
      reality, only symbols. Boltzmann refutes this view, fully aware
      that he is refuting phenomenalist physics. Rey refutes this view
      thinking he is defending phenomenalism! He says: “We could
      not refuse to class Maxwell and Hertz among the
      ‘mechanists’ because they limited themselves to
      equations similar to the differential equations of
      Lagrange’s dynamics. This does not mean that in the
      opinion of Maxwell and Hertz we shall be unable to build a
      mechanical theory of electricity out of real elements. Quite the
      contrary, the fact that we represent electrical phenomena in a
      theory the form of which is identical with the general form of
      classical mechanics is proof of the possibility . . .”
      (p. 253). The indefiniteness of the present solution of the
      problem “will diminish in proportion as the
      nature of the quantities, i.e., elements, that
      figure in the equations are more precisely determined.”
      The fact that one or another form of material motion has not yet
      been investigated is not regarded by Rey as a reason for denying
      the materiality of motion. “The homogeneity of
      matter” (p. 262), not as a postulate, but as a result of
      experience and of the development of science, “the
      homogeneity of the object of physics"—this is the
      condition that makes the application of measurement and
      mathematical calculations possible.
    

Here is Rey’s estimate of the criterion of practice in the
      theory of knowledge: “Contrary to the propositions of
      scepticism, it seems legitimate to say that the practical value
      of science is derived from its theoretical value”
      (p. 368). Rey prefers not to speak of the fact that these
      propositions of scepticism are unequivocally accepted by Mach,
      Poincaré and their entire school. “They

[the practical value and theoretical value of
      science]

are the two inseparable and strictly parallel
      aspects of its objective value. To say that a law of nature has
      practical value . . . is fundamentally the same as saying that
      this law of nature has objectivity. To act on the object implies
      to modify the object; it implies a reaction on the part of the
      object that conforms to the expectation or anticipation
      contained in the proposition in virtue of which we acted on the
      object. Hence, this expectation

    

or anticipation contains
      elements controlled by the object and by the action it
      undergoes. . . . In these diverse theories there is thus a part
      of objectivity” (p. 368). This is a thoroughly
      materialist, and only materialist, theory of knowledge, for
      other points of view, and Machism in particular, deny that the
      criterion of practice has objective significance, i.e.,
      significance that does not depend upon man and mankind.
    

To sum up, Rey approached the question from an angle entirely
      different from that of Ward, Cohen, and Co., but he arrived at
      the same result, namely, the recognition that the materialist
      and idealist trends form the basis of the division between the
      two principal schools in modern physics.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM

( Chapter Five: The Recent Revolution in Natural Science and Philosophical Idealism )
7. A Russian “Idealist
Physicist”

Owing to certain unfortunate conditions under which I am obliged
      to work, I have been almost entirely unable to acquaint myself
      with the Russian literature of the subject under discussion. I
      shall confine myself to an exposition of an article that has an
      important bearing on my theme written by our notorious
      arch-reactionary philosopher, Mr. Lopatin.



The article appeared
      in the September-October issue of Problems of Philosophy and
      Psychology,[1] 1907, and is entitled “An
      Idealist Physicist.” A “true-Russian”
      philosophical idealist, Mr. Lopatin bears the same relation to
      the contemporary European idealists as, for example, the Union
      of the Russian
People[2] does to the reactionary parties of
      the West. All the more instructive is it, therefore, to see how
      similar philosophical trends manifest themselves in totally
      different cultural and social surroundings. Mr. Lopatin’s
      article is, as the French say, an éloge—a
      eulogy—of the Russian physicist, the late N. I. Shishkin
      (died 1906). Mr. Lopatin was fascinated by the fact that this
      cultured man, who was much interested in Hertz and the new
      physics generally, was not only a Right-Wing Constitutional
      Democrat (p. 339) but a deeply religious man, a devotee of the
      philosophy of Vladimir Solovyov, and so on and so
      forth. However, in spite of the fact that his main line of
      “endeavour” lies in the borderland between
      philosophy and the police department, Mr. Lopatin has also
      furnished certain material for a characterisation of the
      epistemological views of

    

this idealist
      physicist. Mr. Lopatin writes: “He was a genuine
      positivist in his tireless endeavour to give the broadest
      possible criticism of the methods of investigation, suppositions
      and facts of science from the standpoint of their suitability as
      means and material for the construction of an integral and
      perfected world outlook. In this respect N. I. Shishkin was the
      very antipode of many of his contemporaries. In previous
      articles of mine in this periodical, I have frequently
      endeavoured to explain the heterogeneous and often shaky
      materials from which the so-called scientific world outlook is
      made up. They include established facts, more or less bold
      generalisations, hypotheses that are convenient at the given
      moment for one or another field of science, and even auxiliary
      scientific fictions. And all this is elevated to the dignity of
      incontrovertible objective truths, from the standpoint of which
      all other ideas and all other beliefs of a philosophical and
      religious nature must be judged, and everything in them that is
      not indicated in these truths must be rejected. Our highly
      talented natural scientist and thinker, Professor
      V. I. Vernadsky, has shown with exemplary clarity how shallow
      and unfounded are these claims to convert the scientific views
      of a given historical period into an immobile, dogmatic system
      obligatory for all. And it is not only the broad reading public
      that is guilty of making such a conversion

[footnote by Mr. Lopatin : “For the
      broad public a number of popular books have been written, the
      purpose of which is to foster the conviction that there exists
      such a scientific catechism providing an answer to all
      questions. Typical works of this kind are Büchner’s
      Force and Matter and Haeckel’s The Riddle of
      the Universe"]

and not only individual scientists in
      particular branches of science; what is even more strange is
      that this sin is frequently committed by the official
      philosophers, all of whose efforts are at times directed only to
      proving that they are saying nothing but what has been said
      before them by representatives of the several sciences, and that
      they are only saying it in their own language.
    

      “N. I. Shishkin had no trace of prejudiced dogmatism. He
      was a convinced champion of the mechanical explanation of the
      phenomena of nature, but for him it was only a method

    

of
      investigation . . .” (p. 341). So, so . . . a familiar
      refrain! “He was far from believing that the mechanical
      theory reveals the true nature of the phenomena investigated; he
      regarded it only as the most convenient and fertile method of
      unifying and explaining them for the purposes of science. For
      him, therefore, the mechanical conception of nature and the
      materialist view of nature by no means coincide.” Exactly
      as in the case of the authors of the Studies
      “in” the Philosophy of Marxism !
      “Quite the contrary, it seemed to him that in questions of
      a higher order, the mechanical theory ought to take a very
      critical, even a conciliatory attitude.”
    

In the language of the Machians this is called “overcoming
      the obsolete, narrow and one-sided” opposition between
      materialism and idealism. “Questions of the first
      beginning and ultimate end of things, of the inner nature of our
      mind, of freedom of the will, the immortality of the soul and so
      forth, cannot in their full breadth of meaning come within its
      scope—since as a method of investigation it is confined
      within the natural limits of its applicability solely to the
      facts of physical experience” (p. 342). The last two lines
      are an undoubted plagiarism from A. Bogdanov’s
      Empirio-momsm.


      “Light can be regarded"—wrote Shishkin in his
      article “Psycho-Physical Phenomena from the Standpoint of
      the Mechanical Theory” (Problems of Philosophy and
      Psychology, Bk. 1, p. 127)—"as substance, as motion,
      as electricity, as sensation.”
    

There is no doubt that Mr. Lopatin is absolutely right in
      ranking Shishkin among the positivists and that this physicist
      belonged body and soul to the Machian school of the new
      physics. In his statement on light, Shishkin means to say that
      the various methods of regarding light are various methods of
      “organising experience” (in A. Bogdanov’s
      terminology), all equally legitimate from different points of
      view, or that they are various “connections of
      elements” (in Mach’s terminology), and that, in any
      case, the physicists’ theory of light is not a copy of
      objective reality. But Shishkin argues very badly. “Light
      can be regarded as substance, as motion. . .” he says. But
      in nature there is neither substance without motion nor motion
      without



substance.

    

Shishkin’s first
      “apposition” is meaningless. . . . “As
      electricity. . . .” Electricity is a movement of
      substance, hence Shishkin is wrong here too. The electromagnetic
      theory of light has shown that light and electricity are forms
      of motion of one and the same substance (ether). “As
      sensation. . . .” Sensation is an image of matter in
      motion. Save through sensations, we can know nothing either of
      the forms of substance or of the forms of motion; sensations are
      evoked by the action of matter in motion upon our
      sense-organs. That is how science views it. The sensation of red
      reflects ether vibrations of a frequency of approximately 450
      trillions per second. The sensation of blue reflects ether
      vibrations of a frequency of approximately 620 trillions per
      second. The vibrations of the ether exist independently of our
      sensations of light. Our sensations of light depend on the
      action of the vibrations of the ether on the human organ of
      vision. Our sensations reflect objective reality, i.e.,
      some thing that exists independently of humanity and of human
      sensations. That is how science views it. Shishkin’s
      argument against materialism is the cheapest kind of sophistry.

      November 1889 to April 1918 (from 1894 it, was published by the

      P. B. Struve and S. N. Bulgakov, and in the years of
      reaction—A. Bogdanov and other Machists. From 1894 it was
      edited by L. M. Lopatin.

Union of the Russian People—an ultra-reactionary,
      Black-Hundred organisation of the monarchists, formed in October
      1905 in St. Petersburg for combating the revolutionary
      movement. The Union united reactionary landlords, big house
      owners, merchants, police officials, clergy, urban
      petty-bourgeoisie, kulaks, and declassed and criminal
      elements. It was headed by V. A. Bobrinsky, A. I. Dubrovin,
      P. A. Krushevan, N. E. Markov 2nd, V. M. Purish kevich and
      others. Its press organs were the newspapers Russkoye Znamya
      (Russian Flag), Obyedineniye (Union), and Groza
      (Storm). Branches of the Union were opened in many Russian
      towns.
The Union defended the continuance of the tsarist autocracy,
    the preservation of semi-feudal landlordism and the privileges of
    the nobility. Its motto was the monarchist, nationalist slogan of
    the feudal epoch—“orthodox religion, autocracy,
    nationhood”. It chose pogroms and murder as its chief weapon
    against the revolution. Helped and protected by the police, its
    members openly and with impunity beat up and murdered leading
    revolutionary workers and representatives of the democratic
    intelligentsia, disrupted and fired on meetings, organised
    anti-Jewish pogroms and viciously persecuted non-Russian
    nationalities.
    

After the dissolution of the Second Duma, the Union split into
      two organisations: the “Chamber of the Archangel Michael” headed
      by Purishkevich, which advocated using the Third Duma for
      counter-revolutionary aims, and the Union of the Russian People
      proper, headed by Dubrovin, which continued the tactics of open
      terrorism. Both of the Black-Hundred organisations were abolised
      during the February bourgeois-democratic revolution of
      1917. After the October Socialist Revolution, former members of
      these organisations took an active part in counter-revolutionary
      revolts and conspiracies against the Soviet power.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Five: The Recent Revolution in Natural Science and Philosophical Idealism )
8. The Essence and Significance of
“Physical” Idealism

We have seen that the question of the epistemological deductions
      that can be drawn from the new physics has been raised and is
      being discussed from the most varied points of view in English,
      German and French literature. There can be no doubt that we have
      before us a certain international ideological current, which is
      not dependent upon any one philosophical system, but which is
      the result of certain general causes Iying outside the sphere of
      philosophy. The foregoing review of the facts undoubtedly shows
      that Machism is “connected” with the new physics,
      but at the same time reveals that the version of this connection
      spread by our Machians is fundamentally incorrect. As
      in philosophy, so in physics, our Machians slavishly follow the
      fashion, and are unable from their own, Marxist,
      standpoint to give a general survey of particular currents and
      to judge the place they occupy.
    
 

A double falsity pervades all the talk about Mach’s
      philosophy being “the philosophy of twentieth-century
      natural science,” “the recent philosophy of the
      sciences,” “recent natural-scientific
      positivism” and so forth. (Bogdanov in the introduction to
      Analysis of Sensations, pp. iv, xii; cf. also
      Yushkevich, Valentinov and Co.) Firstly, Machism is
      ideologically connected with only one school in
      one branch of modern science. Secondly, and this is the
      main point, what in Machism is connected with this school is
      not what distinguishes it from all other trends and systems of
      idealist philosophy, but what it has in common with
      philosophical idealism in general. It suffices to cast a
      glance at the ideological current in question as a
      whole in order to leave no shadow of doubt as to the truth
      of this statement. Take the physicists of this school: the
      German Mach, the Frenchman Henri Poincaré, the Belgian
      P. Duhem, the Englishman Karl Pearson. They have much in common:
      they have the same basis and are following the same direction,
      as each of them rightly acknowledges. But what they have in
      common includes neither the doctrine of empirio-criticism in
      general, nor Mach’s doctrine, say, of the
      “world-elements” in particular. The three latter
      physicists even know nothing of either of these doctrines. They
      have “only” one thing in common—philosophical
      idealism, towards which they all, without exception,
      tend more or less consciously, more or less
      decisively. Take the philosophers who base themselves on
      this school of the new physics, who try to ground it
      epistemologically and to develop it, and you will again find the
      German immanentists, the disciples of Mach, the French
      neo-criticists and idealists, the English spiritualists, the
      Russian Lopatin and, in addition, the one and only
      empirio-monist, A. Bogdanov. They all have only one thing in
      common, namely, that they all—more or less consciously,
      more or less decisively, either with an abrupt and precipitate
      slant towards fideism, or with a personal aversion to it (as in
      Bogdanov’s case)—are vehicles of philosophical
      idealism.
    

The fundamental idea of the school of the new physics under
      discussion is the denial of the objective reality given us in
      our sensation and reflected in our theories, of the doubt as to
      the existence of such a reality. Here this school departs from
      materialism (inaccurately called realism,
      neo-mechanism,

    

hylo-kinetism, and not in any appreciable degree
      consciously developed by the physicists), which by general
      acknowledgment prevails among the physicists—and
      departs from it as a school of “physical” idealism.
    

To explain this last term, which sounds very strange, it is
      necessary to recall an episode in the history of modern
      philosophy and modern science. In 1866 L. Feuerbach attacked
      Johannes Müller, the famous founder of modern physiology,
      and ranked him with the “physiological idealists”
      (Werke, Vol. X, p. 197). The idealism of this
      physiologist consisted in the fact that when investigating the
      significance of the mechanism of our sense-organs in relation to
      sensations, showing, for instance, that the sensation of light
      is produced as the result of the action of various stimuli on
      the eye, he was inclined to arrive from this at a denial that
      our sensations are images of objective reality. This tendency of
      one school of scientists towards “physiological
      idealism,” i.e., towards an idealist
      interpretation of certain data of physiology, was very
      accurately discerned by L. Feuerbach. The
      “connection” between physiology and philosophical
      idealism, chiefly of the Kantian kind, was for a long time after
      that exploited by reactionary philosophy. F. A. Lange made great
      play of physiology in support of Kantian idealism and in
      refutation of materialism; while among the immanentists (whom
      Bogdanov so incorrectly places midway between Mach and Kant),
      J. Rehmke in 1882 specially campaigned against the allegation
      that Kantianism was con firmed by
physiology.[1]

That a number of eminent physiologists at that
      time gravitated towards idealism and Kantianism is as
      indisputable as that today a number of eminent physicists
      gravitate towards philosophical
      idealism. “Physical” idealism, i.e., the
      idealism of a certain school of physicists at the end of the
      nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century,
      no more “refutes” materialism, no more establishes
      the connection between idealism (or empirio-criticism) and
      natural science, than did the similar efforts of F. A. Lange and
      the “physiological” idealists. The deviation

    

towards
      reactionary philosophy manifested in both cases by one school of
      scientists in one branch of science is a temporary deflection, a
      transitory period of sickness in the history of science, an
      ailment of growth, mainly brought on by the abrupt
      breakdown of old established concepts.
    

The connection between modern “physical” idealism
      and the crisis of modern physics is, as we have already pointed
      out, generally acknowledged. “The arguments of sceptical
      criticism levelled against modern physics"—writes A. Rey,
      who is referring not so much to the sceptics as to the outspoken
      adherents of fideism, like Brunetiere—"essentially amount
      to the proverbial argument of all sceptics: a diversity of
      opinions” (among the physicists). But this diversity
      “proves nothing against the objectivity of physics.”
      “In the history of physics, as in history generally, one
      can distinguish great periods which differ by the form and
      general aspect of theories. . . . But as soon as a discovery is
      made that affects all fields of physics because it establishes
      some cardinal fact hitherto badly or very partially perceived,
      the entire aspect of physics is modified; a new period sets
      in. This is what occurred after Newton’s discoveries, and
      after the discoveries of Joule-Mayer and Carnot-Clausius. The
      same thing, apparently, is taking place since the discovery of
      radioactivity. . . . The historian who later sees things from
      the necessary distance has no trouble in discerning a steady
      evolution where contemporaries saw conflicts, contradictions,
      and divisions into various schools. Apparently, the crisis which
      physics has undergone in recent years (despite the conclusions
      drawn from it by philosophical criticism) is no different. It
      even excellently illustrates the typical crisis of growth
      (crise de croissance) occasioned by the great modern
      discoveries. The undeniable transformation of physics which will
      result (could there be evolution or progress without it?) will
      not perceptibly alter the scientific spirit” (op. cit.,
      pp. 370-72).
    

Rey the conciliator tries to unite all schools of modern physics
      against fideisml This is a falsity, well meant, but a falsity
      nevertheless; for the trend of the school of
      Mach-Poincaré-Pearson towards idealism (i.e.,
      refined fideism)

    

is beyond dispute. And the objectivity of
      physics that is associated with the basis of the
      “scientific spirit,” as distinct from the fideist
      spirit, and that Rey defends so ardently, is nothing but a
      “shamefaced” formulation of materialism. The basic
      materialist spirit of physics, as of all modern science, will
      overcome all crises, but only by the indispensable replacement
      of metaphysical materialism by dialectical materialism.
    

Rey the conciliator very often tries to gloss over the fact that
      the crisis in modern physics consists in the latter’s
      deviation from a direct, resolute and irrevocable recognition of
      the objective value of its theories. But facts are stronger than
      all attempts at reconciliation. The mathematicians, writes Rey,
      “in dealing with a science, the subject matter of which,
      apparently at least, is created by the mind of the scientist,
      and in which, at any rate, concrete phenomena are not involved
      in the investigation, have formed too abstract a conception of
      the science of physics. Attempts have been made to bring it ever
      closer to mathematics, and the general conception of mathematics
      has been transferred to the conception of physics. . . . This is
      an invasion of the mathematical spirit into the methods of
      judging and understanding physics that is denounced by all the
      experimenters. And is it not to this influence, none the less
      powerful because at times concealed, that are often due the
      uncertainty, the wavering of mind regarding the objectivity of
      physics, and the detours made or the obstacles surmounted in
      order to demonstrate it? . . .” (p. 227).
    

This is excellently said. “Wavering of mind” as to
      the objectivity of physics—this is the very essence of
      fashionable “physical” idealism.
    

      “. . . The abstract fictions of mathematics seem to have
      interposed a screen between physical reality and the manner in
      which the mathematicians understand the science of this
      reality. They vaguely feel the objectivity of
      physics. . . . Although they desire above all to be objective
      when they engage in physics; although they seek to find and
      retain a foothold in reality, they are still haunted by old
      habits. So that even in the concepts of energetics, which had to
      be built more solidly and with fewer hypotheses than the

    

old
      mechanism—which sought to copy (décalquer)
      the sensible universe and not to reconstruct it—we are
      still dealing with the theories of the
      mathematicians. . . . They [the mathematicians] have done
      everything to save objectivity, for they are aware that without
      objectivity there can be no physics. . . . But the complexity or
      deviousness of their theories nevertheless leaves an uneasy
      feeling. It is too artificial, too far-fetched, too stilted
      (édifié); the experimenter here does not feel
      the spontaneous confidence which constant contact with physical
      reality gives him. . . . This in effect is what is said by all
      physicists who are primarily physicists or who are exclusively
      physicists—and their name is legion; this is what is said
      by the entire neo-mechanist school. . . . The crisis in physics
      lies in the conquest of the realm of physics by the mathematical
      spirit. The progress of physics on the one hand, and the
      progress of mathematics on the other, led in the nineteenth
      century to a close amalgamation between these two
      sciences. . . . Theoretical physics has become mathematical
      physics. . . . Then there began the formal period, that is to
      say, the period of mathematical physics, purely mathematical;
      mathematical physics not as a branch of physics so to speak, but
      as a branch of mathematics cultivated by the
      mathematicians. Along this new line the mathematician,
      accustomed to conceptual (purely logical) elements, which
      furnish the sole subject matter of his work, and feeling himself
      cramped by crude, material elements, which he found
      insufficiently pliable, necessarily always tended to reduce them
      to abstractions as far as possible, to present them in an
      entirely non-material and conceptual manner, or even to ignore
      them altogether. The elements, as real, objective data, as
      physical elements, so to speak, completely
      disappeared. There remained only formal relations represented by
      the differential equations. . . . If the mathematician is not
      the dupe of his constructive work, when he analyses theoretical
      physics . . . he can recover its ties with experience and its
      objective value, but at a first glance, and to the uninitiated
      person, we seem faced with an arbitrary development. . . . The
      concept, the notion, has everywhere replaced the real
      element. . . . Thus, historically, by virtue of the mathematical
      form assumed by theoretical physics, is explained . . . the
      ailment (le malaise), the

    

crisis of physics, and its
      apparent withdrawal from objective facts” (pp. 228-32).
    

Such is the first cause of “physical” idealism. The
      reactionary attempts are engendered by the very progress of
      science. The great successes achieved by natural science, the
      approach to elements of matter so homogeneous and simple that
      their laws of motion can be treated mathematically, encouraged
      the mathematicians to overlook matter. “Matter
      disappears,” only equations remain. In the new stage of
      development and apparently in a new manner, we get the old
      Kantian idea: reason prescribes laws to nature. Hermann Cohen,
      who, as we have seen, rejoices over the idealist spirit of the
      new physics, goes so far as to advocate the introduction of
      higher mathematics in the schools—in order to imbue
      high-school students with the spirit of idealism, which is being
      extinguished in our materialistic age (F. A. Lange,
      Geschichte des Materialismus, 5. Auflage, 1896, Bd. II,
      S. xlix). This, of course, is the ridiculous dream of a
      reactionary and, in fact, there is and can be nothing here but a
      temporary infatuation with idealism on the part of a small
      number of specialists. But what is highly characteristic is the
      way the drowning man clutches at a straw, the subtle means
      whereby representatives of the educated bourgeoisie artificially
      attempt to preserve, or to find a place for, the fideism which
      is engendered among the masses of the people by their ignorance
      and their downtrodden condition, and by the wild absurdities of
      capitalist contradictions.
    

Another cause which bred “physical” idealism is the
      principle of relativism, the relativity of our
      knowledge, a principle which, in a period of breakdown of the
      old theories, is taking a firm hold upon the physicists, and
      which, if the latter are ignorant of dialectics, is
      bound to lead to idealism.
    

The question of the relation between relativism and dialectics
      plays perhaps the most important part in explaining the
      theoretical misadventures of Machism. Take Rey, for instance,
      who like all European positivists has no conception whatever of
      Marxist dialectics. He employs the word dialectics exclusively
      in the sense of idealist philosophical speculation. As a result,
      although he feels that the new physics has gone astray on the
      question of

    

relativism, he nevertheless flounders helplessly and
      attempts to differentiate between moderate and immoderate
      relativism. Of course, “immoderate relativism logically,
      if not in practice, borders on actual scepticism”
      (p. 215), but there is no “immoderate” relativism,
      you see, in Poincaré. Just fancy, one can, like an
      apothecary, weigh out a little more or a little less relativism
      and thus save Machism!
    

As a matter of fact, the only theoretically correct formulation
      of the question of relativism is given in the dialectical
      materialism of Marx and Engels, and ignorance of it is bound to
      lead from relativism to philosophical idealism. Incidentally,
      the failure to understand this fact is enough to render
      Mr. Berman’s absurd book, Dialectics in the Light of
      the Modern Theory of Knowledge, utterly
      valueless. Mr. Berman repeats the old, old nonsense about
      dialectics, which he has entirely failed to understand. We have
      already seen that in the theory of knowledge all the
      Machians, at every step, reveal a similar lack of
      understanding.
    

All the old truths of physics, including those which were
      regarded as firmly established and incontestable, have proven to
      be relative truths—hence, there can be no
      objective truth independent of mankind. Such is the argument not
      only of all the Machians, but of the “physical”
      idealists in general. That absolute truth results from the
      sum-total of relative truths in the course of their development;
      that relative truths represent relatively faithful reflections
      of an object existing independently of man; that these
      reflections become more and more faithful; that every scientific
      truth, notwithstanding its relative nature, contains an element
      of absolute truth—all these propositions, which are
      obvious to anyone who has thought over Engels’
      Anti-Dühring, are for the “modern”
      theory of knowledge a book with seven seals.
    

Such works as Duhem’s Theory of
      Physics,[2]

or Stallo’s,[3]

which Mach particularly recommends, show
      very clearly that these “physical” idealists attach
      the most significance

    

to the proof of the relativity of our
      knowledge, and that they are in reality vacillating between
      idealism and dialectical materialism. Both authors, who belong
      to different periods, and who approach the question from
      different angles (Duhem’s speciality is physics, in which
      field he has worked for twenty years; Stallo was an erstwhile
      orthodox Hegelian who grew ashamed of his own book on natural
      philosophy, written in 1848 in the old Hegelian spirit),
      energetically combat the atomistic-mechanical conception of
      nature. They point to the narrowness of this conception, to the
      impossibility of accepting it as the limit of our knowledge, to
      the petrification of many of the ideas of writers who hold this
      conception. And it is indeed undeniable that the old
      materialism did suffer from such a defect; Engels reproached the
      earlier materialists for their failure to appreciate the
      relativity of all scientific theories, for their ignorance of
      dialectics and for their exaggeration of the mechanical point of
      view. But Engels (unlike Stallo) was able to discard Hegelian
      idealism and to grasp the great and true kernel of
      Hegelian dialectics. Engels rejected the old metaphysical
      materialism for dialectical materialism, and not for
      relativism that sinks into subjectivism. “The mechanical
      theory,” says Stallo, for instance, “in common with
      all metaphysical theories, hypostases partial, ideal, and, it
      may be, purely conventional groups of attributes, or single
      attributes, and treats them as varieties of objective
      reality” (p. 150). This is quite true, if you do not deny
      objective reality and combat metaphysics for being
      anti-dialectical. Stallo does not realise this clearly. He has
      not understood materialist dialectics and therefore frequently
      slips, by way of relativism, into subjectivism and idealism.
    

The same is true of Duhem. With an enormous expenditure of
      labour, and with the help of a number of interesting and
      valuable examples from the history of physics, such as one
      frequently encounters in Mach, he shows that “every law of
      physics is provisional and relative, because it is
      approximate” (p. 280). The man is hammering at an open
      door!—will be the thought of the Marxist when he reads the
      lengthy disquisitions on this subject. But that is just the
      trouble with Duhem, Stallo, Mach and Poincaré, that they do
      not perceive the door opened by dialectical materialism.

    

Being
      unable to give a correct formulation of relativism, they slide
      from the latter into idealism. “A law of physics, properly
      speaking, is neither true nor false, but
      approximate"—writes Duhem (p. 274). And this
      “but” contains the beginning of the falsity, the
      beginning of the obliteration of the boundary between a
      scientific theory that approximately reflects the
      object, i.e., approaches objective truth, and an
      arbitrary, fantastic, or purely conventional theory, such as,
      for example, a religious theory or the theory of the game of
      chess.
    

Duhem carries this falsity to the point of declaring that the
      question whether “material reality” corresponds to
      per ceptual phenomena is metaphysics (p. 10). Away with
      the question of reality! Our concepts and hypotheses are mere
      signs (p. 26), “arbitrary” (p. 27) constructions,
      and so forth. There is only one step from this to idealism, to
      the “physics of the believer,” which M. Pierre Duhem
      preaches in the Kantian spirit (Rey, p. 162; cf., p. 160). But
      the good Adler (Fritz)—also a Machian would-be
      Marxist!—could find nothing cleverer to do than to
      “correct” Duhem as follows: Duhem, he claims,
      eliminates the “realities concealed behind phenomena only
      as objects of theory, but not as objects of
      reality.”[4]

This is the familiar criticism of Kantianism
      from the standpoint of Hume and Berkeley.
    

But, of course, there can be no question of any conscious
      Kantianism on the part of Duhem. He is merely
      vacillating as is Mach, not knowing on what to base his
      relativism. In many passages he comes very close to dialectical
      materialism. He says that we know sound “such as it is in
      relation to us but not as it is in itself, in the
      sound-producing bodies. This reality, of which our sensations
      give us only the external and the veil, is made known to us by
      the theories of acoustics. They tell us that where our
      perceptions register only this appearance which we call sound,
      there really exists a very small and very rapid periodic
      movement,” etc. (p. 7). Bodies are not symbols of
      sensations, but sensations are symbols (or rather, images) of
      bodies. “The development of physics gives rise to a
      constant struggle between nature, which

    

does not tire of
      offering new material, and reason, which does not tire of
      cognising” (p. 32). Nature is infinite, just as its
      smallest particle (including the electron) is infinite, but
      reason just as infinitely transforms
      “things-in-themselves” into
      “things-for-us.” “Thus, the struggle between
      reality and the laws of physics will continue indefinitely; to
      every law that physics may formulate, reality will sooner or
      later oppose a rude refutation in the form of a fact; but,
      indefatigable, physics will improve, modify, and complicate the
      refuted law” (p. 290). This would be a quite correct
      exposition of dialectical materialism if the author firmly held
      to the existence of this objective reality independent of
      humanity. “. . . The theory of physics is not a purely
      artificial system which is convenient today and unsuitable
      tomorrow . . . it is a classification, which becomes more and
      more natural, a reflection, which grows clearer and clearer, of
      the realities that the experimental method cannot contemplate
      face to face” (p. 445).
    

In this last phrase the Machian Duhem flirts with Kantian
      idealism: it is as if the way is being opened for a method other
      than the “experimental” one, and as if we cannot
      know the “things-in-themselves” directly,
      immediately, face to face. But if the theory of physics becomes
      more and more natural, that means that “nature,”
      reality, “reflected” by this theory, exists
      independently of our consciousness—and that is precisely
      the view of dialectical materialism.
    

In a word, the “physical” idealism of today, just as
      the “physiological” idealism of yesterday, merely
      means that one school of natural scientists in one branch of
      natural science has slid into a reactionary philosophy, being
      unable to rise directly and at once from metaphysical
      materialism to dialectical
materialism.[5]

This step is being

    

made, and will be made, by modern
      physics; but it is making for the only true method and the only
      true philosophy of natural science not directly, but by zigzags,
      not consciously but instinctively, not clearly perceiving its
      “final goal,” but drawing closer to it gropingly,
      hesitatingly, and sometimes even with its back turned to
      it. Modern physics is in travail; it is giving birth to
      dialectical materialism. The process of child-birth is
      painful. And in addition to a living healthy being, there are
      bound to be produced certain dead products, refuse fit only for
      the garbage-heap. And the entire school of physical idealism,
      the entire empirio-critical philosophy, together with
      empirio-symbolism, empirio-monism, and so on, and so forth, must
      be regarded as such refuse!

The
      famous chemist, William Ramsay, says: “I have been
      frequently asked: ‘But is not electricity a vibration? How
      can wireless telegraphy be explained by the passage of little
      particles or corpuscles?’ The answer is:
      ‘Electricity is a thing ; it is
      (Ramsay’s italics) these minute corpuscles, but when they
      leave an object, a wave, like a wave of light, spreads through
      the ether, and this wave is used for wireless
      telegraphy’”  (William Ramsay, Essays,
      Biographical and Chemical, London, 1908,
      p. 126). Having spoken about the transformation of radium into
      helium, Ramsay remarks: “At least one so-called element
      can no longer be regarded as ultimate matter, but is itself
      undergoing

   

change into a simpler form of matter”
      (p. 160). “Now it is almost certain that negative
      electricity is a particular form of matter; and positive
      electricity is matter deprived of negative
      electricity—that is, minus this electric matter”
      (p. 176). “Now what is electricity? It used to be
      believed, formerly, that there were two kinds of electricity,
      one called positive and the other negative. At that time it
      would not have been possible to answer the question. But recent
      researches make it probable that what used to be called negativc
      electricity is really a substance. Indeed, the relative weight
      of its particles has been measured; each is about one seven
      hundredth of the mass of an atom of hydrogen. . . . Atoms of
      electricity are named ‘electrons’”
  (p. 196). If our Machians who write books and articles on
      philosophical subjects were capable of thinking, they would
      understand that the expression “matter disappears,”
      “matter is reduced to electricity,” etc., is only an
      epistemologically helpless expression of the truth that science
      is able to discover new forms of matter, new forms of material
      motion, to reduce the old forms to the new forms, and so
      on.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    


Chapter Six:

Empirio-Criticism and Historical Materialism

The Russian Machians, as
    we have already seen, are divided into two camps. Mr. V. Chernov
    and the collaborators of the Russkoye
Bogatstvo[3] are
    downright and consistent opponents of dialectical materialism,
    both in philosophy and history. The other company of Machians, in
    whom we are more interested here, are would-be Marxists and try in
    every way to assure their readers that Machism is compatible with
    the historical materialism of Marx and Engels. True, these
    assurances are for the most part nothing but assurances; not a
    single Machian would-be Marxist has ever made the slightest
    attempt to present in any systematic way the real trends of the
    founders of empirio-criticism in the field of the social
    sciences. We shall dwell briefly on this question, turning first
    to the statements to be found in writings of the German
    empirio-criticists and then to those of their Russian disciples.
    
( Chapter Five: The Recent Revolution in Natural Science and Philosophical Idealism )
1. The Excursions of the German
Empirio-Criticists Into The Field of the Social Sciences

In 1895, when R. Avenarius was still alive, there appeared in
      the philosophical journal edited by him an article by his
      disciple, F. Blei, entitled “Metaphysics in Political
      Economy.”[1]

All the
      teachers of empirio-criticism wage war

    

on the
      “metaphysics” not only of explicit and conscious
      philosophical materialism, but also of natural science, which
      instinctively adopts the standpoint of the materialist theory of
      knowledge. The disciple takes up arms against metaphysics in
      political economy. The fight is directed against the most varied
      schools of political economy, but we are interested only in the
      character of the empirio-critical argument against the school of
      Marx and Engels.
    

      “The purpose of the present investigation,” writes
      Franz Blei, “is to show that all political economy until
      now, in its endeavour to interpret the phenomena of economic
      life, operates with metaphysical premises; that it
      . . . ‘derives’ the ‘laws’ governing an
      economy from the ‘nature’ of the latter, and man is
      only an incidental factor in relation to these
      ‘laws.’ . . . In all its theories political economy
      has hitherto rested on metaphysical grounds; all its theories
      are unbiological, and therefore unscientific and worthless for
      knowledge. . . . The theoreticians do not know what they are
      building their theories on, what the soil is of which these
      theories are the fruit. They regard themselves as realists
      operating without any premises whatever, for they are, forsooth,
      dealing with ‘sober’ (nüchterne),
      ‘practical’ and ‘tangible’
      (sinnfällige) economic phenomena. . . . And all
      have that family resemblance to many trends in physiology which
      only the same parents—viz., metaphysics and
      speculation—can transmit to their children, in our case to
      the physiologists and economists. One school of economists
      analyses the ‘phenomena’ of ‘economy’

[Avenarius and his school put ordinary words
      in quotation marks in order to show that they, the true
      philosophers, discern the essentially “metaphysical
      character” of a use of words which is so vulgar and so
      unrefined by “epistemological analysis”]

      without placing what they find (das Gefundene) in this
      way into relation with the behaviour of individuals; the
      physiologists exclude the behaviour of the individual from their
      investigations as being ‘actions of the soul’
      (Wirkungen der Seele), while the economists of this
      trend declare the behaviour of individuals to be negligible in
      relation to the ‘immanent laws of economy’
      (pp. 378–79). With Marx, theory established ‘economic
      laws’ from construed processes, and these
      ‘laws’ figured in the initial section
      (Initialabschnitt) of

    

the dependent vital series, while
      the economic processes figured in the final section
      (Finalabschnitt). . . . ‘Economy’ was
      transformed by the economists into a transcendental category, in
      which they discovered such ‘laws’ as they wished to
      discover: the ‘laws’ of ‘capital’ and
      ‘labour,’ ‘rent,’ ‘wages’
      and ‘profit.’ The economists transformed man into a
      Platonic idea—‘capitalist,’
      ‘worker,’ etc. Socialism ascribed to the
      ‘capitalist’ the character of being ‘greedy
      for profit,’ liberalism ascribed to the worker the
      character of being ‘exacting’—and both
      characters were moreover explained by the ‘operation of
      the laws of capital’” (pp. 381-82).
    

      “Marx came to the study of French socialism and political
      economy with a socialist world outlook, and his aim as regards
      knowledge was to provide a ‘theoretical foundation’
      for his world outlook in order to ‘safeguard’ his
      initial value. He found the law of value in Ricardo . . . but
      the conclusion which the French Socialists had drawn from
      Ricardo could not satisfy Marx in his endeavour to
      ‘safeguard’ his E-value— brought into a
      vital-difference, i.e., his ‘world
      outlook,’ for these conclusions had already entered as a
      component part into the content of his initial value in the form
      of ‘indignation at the robbery of the workers,’ and
      so forth. The conclusions were rejected as ‘being formally
      untrue economically’ for they are ‘simply an
      application of morality to political economy.’ ‘But
      what formally may be economically incorrect, may all the same be
      correct from the point of view of world history. If the moral
      consciousness of the mass declares an economic fact to be
      unjust, that is a proof that the fact itself has been outlived,
      that other economic facts have made their appearance, owing to
      which the former one has become unbearable and
      untenable. Therefore, a very true economic content may be
      concealed behind the formal economic
      incorrectness.’” (From Engels’ preface to Karl
      Marx’s The Poverty of Philosophy.)
    

Having quoted the above passage from Engels, Blei continues:
      “In the above quotation the middle section (Medial
      abschnitt) of the dependent series which interests us here
      is detached

[abgehoben—a
      technical term of Avenarius’ implying: reached the
      consciousness, separated off].

After the
      ‘cognition’ that an ‘economic fact’ must
      be concealed

    

behind the ‘moral consciousness of
      injustice,’ comes the final section

[Finalabschnitt: the theory of Marx is a
      statement, i.e., an E-value, i.e., a
      vital-difference which passes through three stages, three
      sections, initial, middle and final: Initialabschnitt,
      Medialabschnitt, Finalabschnitt]

      . . . i.e., the ‘cognition’ of that
      ‘economic fact.’ Or, in other words, the task now is
      to ‘find again’ the initial value, his ‘world
      out look,’ in the ‘economic facts’ in order to
      ‘safeguard’ the initial value. This definite
      variation of the dependent series already contains the Marxist
      metaphysics, regardless of how the ‘cognised’
      appears in the final section
      (Finalabschnitt). ‘The socialist world
      outlook,’ as an independent E-value, ‘absolute
      truth,’ is ‘given a basis’
      ‘retrospectively’ by means of a
      ‘special’ theory of knowledge, namely, the economic
      system of Marx and the materialist theory of history. . . . By
      means of the concept of surplus value the
      ‘subjective’ ‘truth,’ in the Marxist
      world outlook finds its ‘objective truth,’ in the
      theory of knowledge of the ‘economic
      categories’—the safeguarding of the initial value is
      completed and metaphysics has retrospectively received its
      critique of knowledge” (pp. 384-86).
    

The reader is probably fuming at us for quoting at such length
      this incredibly trivial rigmarole, this quasi-scientific
      tomfoolery decked out in the terminology of Avenarius. But
      wer den Feind will verstehen, muss im Feindes Lande
      gehen—who would know the enemy must go into the
      enemy’s
territory.[4] And R. Avenarius’
      philosophical journal is indeed enemy territory for
      Marxists. And we invite the reader to restrain for a minute his
      legitimate aversion for the buffoons of bourgeois science and to
      analyse the argument of Avenarius’ disciple and
      collaborator.
    

Argument number one: Marx is a “metaphysician” who
      did not grasp the epistemological “critique of
      concepts,” who did not work out a general theory of
      knowledge and who simply inserted materialism into his
      “special theory of knowledge.”
    

This argument contains nothing original to Blei personally. We
      have already seen scores and hundreds of times that all
      the founders of empirio-criticism and all the Russian
      Machians accuse materialism of “metaphysics,” or,

    

more accurately, they repeat the hackneyed arguments of the
      Kantians, Humeans and idealists against materialist
      “metaphysics.”
    

Argument number two: Marxism is as “metaphysical” as
      natural science (physiology). And here again it is not Blei who
      is “responsible” for this argument, but Mach and
      Avenarius; for it was they who declared war on
      “natural-historical metaphysics,” applying that name
      to the instinctively materialist theory of knowledge to which
      (on their own admission and according to the judgment of all who
      are in any way versed in the subject) the vast majority of
      scientists adhere.
    

Argument number three: Marxism declares that
      “personality” is a quantité
      négligeable, a cypher, that man is an
      “incidental factor,” subject to certain
      “immanent laws of economics,” that an analysis
      des Gefundenen, i.e., of what is found, of
      what is given, etc., is lacking. This argument is a
      complete repetition of the stock of ideas of the
      empirio-critical “principal co-ordination,”
      i.e., of the idealist crotchet in
      Avenarius’ theory. Blei is absolutely right when he says
      that it is impossible to find the slightest hint of such
      idealist nonsense in Marx and Engels, and that from the
      standpoint of this nonsense Marxism must be rejected
      completely, from the very beginning, from its
      fundamental philosophical premises
    

Argument number four: Marx’s theory is
      “unbiological,” it is entirely innocent of
      “vital-differences” and of similar spurious
      biological terms which constitute the “science” of
      the reactionary professor, Avenarius. Blei’s argument is
      correct from the standpoint of Machism, for the gulf between
      Marx’s theory and Avenarius’
      “biological” spillikins is indeed obvious at
      once. We shall presently see how the Russian Machian would-be
      Marxists in effect followed in Blei’s footsteps.
    

Argument number five: the partisanship, the partiality of
      Marx’s theory and his preconceived solution. The
      empirio-criticists as a whole, and not Blei alone,
      claim to be non-partisan both in philosophy and in social
      science. They are neither for socialism nor for liberalism. They
      make no differentiation between the fundamental

    

and
      irreconcilable trends of materialism and idealism in philosophy,
      but endeavour to rise above them. We have traced this
      tendency of Machism through a long series of problems of
      epistemology, and we ought not to be surprised when we encounter
      it in sociology.
    

      “Argument” number six: ridiculing
      “objective” truth. Blei at once sensed, and rightly
      sensed, that historical materialism and Marx’s entire
      economic doctrine are permeated through and through by a
      recognition of objective truth. And Blei accurately expressed
      the tendency of Mach’s and Avenarius’ doctrines,
      when, precisely because of the idea of objective truth, he,
      “from the very threshold,” so to speak, rejected
      Marxism by at once declaring that there was absolutely nothing
      behind the Marxist teaching save the “subjective”
      views of Marx.
    

And if our Machians renounce Blei (as they surely will), we
      shall tell them: You must not blame the mirror for showing a
      crooked face. Blei is a mirror which accurately
      reflects the tendencies of empirio-criticism, and a renouncement
      by our Machians would only bear witness to their good
      intentions—and to their absurd eclectical endeavours to
      combine Marx and Avenarius.
    

Let us pass from Blei to Petzoldt. If the former is a mere
      disciple, the latter is declared by outstanding
      empirio-criticists, such as Lessevich, to be a master. While
      Blei brings up the question of Marxism explicitly,
      Petzoldt—who would not demean himself by dealing with a
      mere Marx or a mere Engels—sets forth in positive form the
      views of empirio-criticism on sociology, which enables us to
      compare them with Marxism.
    

The second volume of Petzoldt’s Einführung in die
      Philosophie der reinen Erfahrung is entitled “Auf
      dem Wege zum Dauernden” (“Towards
      Stability”). The author makes the tendency towards
      stability the basis of his investigation. “The main
      features of the ultimate (endgültige) state of
      stability of humanity can be inferred in its formal aspect. We
      thus arrive at the foundations of ethics, aesthetics and the
      formal theory of knowledge” (p. iii). “Human
      development bears its goal within itself, it also tends towards
      a perfect (vollkommene) state of stability”
      (p. 60). The signs of this are abundant and varied. For
      instance, are there

    

many violent radicals who do not in their
      old age become “more sensible,” more restrained?
      True, this “premature stability” (p. 62) is
      characteristic of the philistine. But do not philistines
      constitute the “compact majority”? (p. 62.)
    

Our philosopher’s conclusion, which he gives in italics,
      is this: “The quintessential feature of all the aims of
      our reasoning and creative activity is stability”
      (p. 72). The explanation is: “Many cannot bear to see a
      key Iying obliquely on the table, still less a picture hanging
      crooked on the wall. . . . And such people are not necessarily
      pedants. . . . It is only that they have a feeling that
      something is not in order” (p. 72, Petzoldt’s
      italics). In a word, the “tendency to stability is a
      striving for an extreme, by its nature ultimate, state”
      (p. 73). All this is taken from the fifth chapter of Volume II
      entitled “Die psychische Tendenz zur
      Stabilität” (“The Psychical Tendency to
      Stability”). The proofs of this tendency are all very
      weighty. For instance: “A striving for an extreme, a
      highest, in the original spatial sense, is pursued by the
      majority of mountain climbers. It is not always the desire for a
      spacious view or joy in the physical exercise of climbing in
      fresh air and wide nature that urges them towards the peaks, but
      also the instinct which is deeply ingrained in every organic
      being to pursue an adopted path of activity until a natural aim
      has been achieved” (p. 73). Another example: the amount of
      money people will pay to secure a complete collection of postage
      stamps! “It makes one’s head swim to examine the
      price list of a dealer in postage stamps. . . . And yet nothing
      is more natural and comprehensible than this urge for
      stability” (p. 74).
    

The philosophically untutored can have no conception of the
      breadth of the principles of stability and of economy of
      thought. Petzoldt develops his “theory” in detail
      for the profane. “Sympathy is an expression of the
      immediate need for a state of stability,” runs §
      28. “Sympathy is not a repetition, a duplication of the
      observed suffering, but suffering on account of this
      suffering. . . . The greatest emphasis must be placed on the
      immediacy of sympathy. If we admit this we thereby admit that
      the welfare of others can concern a man just as immediately and
      fundamentally as his own welfare, and we thus at the same time
      reject every utilitarian and eudemonistic foundation of
      ethics. Thanks to

    

its longing for stability and peace, human
      nature is not fundamentally evil, but anxious to help. . . .
    

      “The immediacy of sympathy is frequently manifested in the
      immediacy of help. The rescuer will often fling himself without
      thought to save a drowning man. He cannot bear the sight of a
      person struggling with death; he forgets his other duties and
      risks his own life and the life of his near ones in order to
      save the useless life of some degraded drunkard; in other words,
      under certain circumstances sympathy can drive one to actions
      that are morally unjustifiable.”
    

And scores and hundreds of pages of empirio-critical philosophy
      are filled with such unutterable platitudes!
    

Morality is deduced from the concept “moral state of
      stability” (The second section of Volume II:
      “Die Dauerbestande der Seele”

[“Stable States of the Soul”],

Chapter I, “Vom ethischen Dauerbestande”

[“On Ethical Stable States”]).

“The
      state of stability, according to the very concept of it,
      contains no conditions of change in any of its components. From
      this it at once follows that it can contain no possibility of
      war” (p. 202). “Economic and social
      equality is implied in the conception of the final
      (endgultig), stable state” (p. 213). This
      “state of stability” is derived not from religion
      but from “science.” The “majority”
      cannot bring it about, as the socialists suppose, nor can the
      power of the socialists “help humanity”
      (p. 207). Oh, no!—it is “free development”
      that will lead to the ideal. Are not, indeed, the profits of
      capital decreasing and are not wages constantly increasing?
      (p. 223). All the assertions about “wage slavery”
      are untrue (p. 229). A slave’s leg could be broken with
      impunity—but now? No, “moral progress” is
      beyond doubt; look at the university settlements in England, at
      the Salvation Army (p. 230), at the German “ethical
      societies.” In the name of “aesthetic
      stability” (Chapter II, Section 2)
      “romanticism” is rejected. But romanticism embraces
      all forms of inordinate extension of the ego, idealism,
      metaphysics, occultism, solipsism, egoism, the “forcible
      coercion of the minority by the majority” and the
      “social-democratic ideal of the organisation of all labour
      by the state”
(pp. 240-41).[2]

 

The sociological excursions of Blei, Petzoldt and Mach are but
      an expression of the infinite stupidity of the philistine,
      smugly retailing the most hackneyed rubbish under cover of a new
      “empirio-critical” systematisation and
      terminology. A pretentious cloak of verbal artifices, clumsy
      devices in syllogistic, subtle scholasticism, in a word, as in
      epistemology, so in sociology—the same reactionary content
      under the same flamboyant signboard.
    

Let us now turn to the Russian Machians.

V. I.  

      Lenin
MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Six: Empirio-Criticism and Historical Materialism )
2. How Bogdanov Corrects and
“Develops” Marx

In his article “The Development of Life in Nature and
      Society” (From the Psychology of Society, 1902,
      p. 35, et seq.), Bogdanov quotes the well-known passage
      from the preface to Zur
Kritik,[1]:



where the “great sociologist”, i.e., Marx, expounds the basis of
historical materialism. Having quoted Marx’s words, Bogdanov declares that
the “old formulation of historical monism, without ceasing to be basically
true, no longer fully satisfies us” (37). The author wishes, therefore, to
correct the theory, or to develop it, starting from the basis of the
theory itself. The author’s chief conclusion is as follows:


“We have shown
      that social forms belong to the comprehensive
      genus—biological adaptations. But we have not
      thereby defined the province of social forms; for a definition,
      not only the genus, but also the species must
      be established. . . . In their struggle for existence men can
      unite only with the help of consciousness : without
      consciousness there can be no intercourse. Hence, social
      life in all its manifestations is a consciously psychical
      life. . . . Society is inseparable from
      consciousness. Social being and social consciousness
      are, in the exact meaning of these terms,
      identical” (pp. 50, 51, Bogdanov’s italics).
    

That this conclusion is absolutely alien to Marxism has been
      pointed out by Orthodox (Philosophical Essays,
    

St. Petersburg, 1906, p. 183, ff.). But Bogdanov responded
      simply by abuse, picking upon an error in quotation:
      instead of “in the exact meaning of these terms,”
      Orthodox had quoted “in the full meaning of these
      terms.” This error was indeed committed, and the author
      had every right to correct it; but to raise a cry of
      “mutilation,” “substitution,” and so
      forth (Empirio-Monism, Bk. III, p. xliv), is simply to
      obscure the essence of the point at issue by wretched
      words. What ever “exact” meaning Bogdanov may have
      invented for the terms “social being” and
      “social consciousness,” there can be no doubt that
      the statement we have quoted is not correct.



      “Social being” and “social
      consciousness” are not identical, just as being in general
      and consciousness in general are not identical. From the fact
      that in their intercoutse men act as conscious beings, it
      does not follow that social consciousness is identical
      with social being. In all social formations of any
      complexity—and in the capitalist social formation in
      particular—people in their intercourse are not
      conscious of what kind of social relations are being
      formed, in accordance with what laws they develop, etc. For
      instance, a peasant when he sells his grain enters into
      “intercourse” with the world producers of grain in
      the world market, but he is not conscious of it; nor is he
      conscious of the kind of social relations that are formed on the
      basis of exchange. Social consciousness reflects social
      being—that is Marx’s teaching. A reflection may be
      an approximately true copy of the reflected, but to speak of
      identity is absurd. Consciousness in general reflects
      being—that is a general principle of all
      materialism. It is impossible not to see its direct and
      inseparable connection with the principle of historical
      materialism: social consciousness reflects social
      being.
    

Bogdanov’s attempt imperceptibly to correct and develop
      Marx in the “spirit of his principles” is an obvious
      distortion of these materialist principles in the
      spirit of idealism. It would be ludicrous to deny
      it. Let us recall Bazarov’s exposition of
      empirio-criticism (not empirio-monism, oh no!—there is
      such a wide, wide difference between these
      “systems”!): “sense-perception is the
      reality existing outside us.” This is plain idealism, a
      plain theory of the identity of consciousness and being. Recall,
      further, the formulation of W. Schuppe,

    

the immanentist (who
      swore and vowed as fervently as Bazarov and Co. that he was not
      an idealist, and who with no less vigour than Bogdanov insisted
      on the very “exact” meaning of his terms):
      “being is consciousness.” Now compare this with the
      refutation of Marx’s historical materialism by
      the immanentist Schubert-Soldern: “Every material process
      of production is always an act of consciousness on the part of
      its observer. . . . In its epistemological aspect, it is not the
      external process of production that is the primary
      (prius), but the subject or subjects; in other words, even
      the purely material process of production does not lead us out
      of the general connection of consciousness
      (Bewusstseinszusammenhang).” (See Das
      menschliche Glück und die soziale Frage, S. 293,
      295-96.)
    

Bogdanov may curse the materialists as much as he pleases for
      “mutilating his thoughts,” but no curses will alter
      the simple and plain fact. The correction of Marx’s theory
      and the development of Marx supposedly in the spirit of Marx by
      the “empirio-monist” Bogdanov in no essential
      respect differ from the way the idealist and
      epistemological solipsist Schubert-Soldern endeavours to refute
      Marx. Bogdanov assures us that he is not an
      idealist. Schubert-Soldern assures us that he is a realist
      (Bazarov even believed him). In our time a philosopher has to
      declare himself a “realist” and an “enemy of
      idealism.” It is about time you understood this,
      Messrs. Machians!
    

The immanentists, the empirio-criticists and the empirio-monists
      all argue over particulars, over details, over the formulation
      of idealism, whereas we from the very outset
      reject all the principles of their philosophy common to this
      trinity. Let Bogdanov, accepting in the best sense and with the
      best of intentions all the conclusions of Marx, preach
      the “identity” of social being and social
      consciousness; we shall say: Bogdanov minus
      “empirio-monism” (or rather, minus Machism)
      is a Marxist. For this theory of the identity of social being
      and social consciousness is sheer nonsense and an
      absolutely reactionary theory. If certain people
      reconcile it with Marxism, with Marxist behaviour, we must admit
      that these people are better than their theory, but we cannot
      justify outrageous theoretical distortions of Marxism.
    
 

Bogdanov reconciles his theory with Marx’s conclusions,
      and sacrifices elementary consistency for the sake of these
      conclusions. Every individual producer in the world economic
      system realises that he is introducing a certain change into the
      technique of production; every owner realises that he exchanges
      certain products for others; but these producers and these
      owners do not realise that in doing so they are thereby changing
      social being. The sum-total of these changes in all
      their ramifications in the capitalist world economy could not be
      grasped even by seventy Marxes. The paramount thing is that the
      laws of these changes have been discovered, that the
      objective logic of these changes and their historical
      development have at bottom and in the main been
      disclosed—objective, not in the sense that a society of
      conscious beings, men, could exist and develop independently of
      the existence of conscious beings (and it is only such trifles
      that Bogdanov stresses by his “theory”),
      but in the sense that social being is independent of
      the social consciousness of men. The fact that you live
      and conduct your business, beget children, produce products and
      exchange them, gives rise to an objectively necessary chain of
      events, a chain of development, which is independent of your
      social consciousness, and is never grasped by the
      latter completely. The highest task of humanity is to comprehend
      this objective logic of economic evolution (the evolution of
      social life) in its general and fundamental features, so that it
      may be possible to adapt to it one’s social
      consciousness and the consciousness of the advanced classes of
      all capitalist countries in as definite, clear and critical a
      fashion as possible.
    

Bogdanov admits all this. And what does this mean? It means
      in effect that his theory of the “identity of
      social being and social consciousness” is thrown
      overboard, that it becomes an empty scholastic appendage, as
      empty, dead and useless as the “theory of general
      substitution” or the doctrine of “elements,”
      “introjection” and the rest of the Machian
      rigmarole. But the “dead lay hold of the living”;
      the dead scholastic appendage, against the will of and
      independently of the consciousness of Bogdanov, converts
      his philosophy into a serviceable tool of the
      Schubert-Solderns and other reactionaries, who in a thousand
      different keys,

    

from a hundred professorial chairs, disseminate
      this dead thing as a living thing, direct it against
      the living thing, for the purpose of stifling it. Bogdanov
      personally is a sworn enemy of reaction in general and of
      bourgeois reaction in particular. Bogdanov’s
      “substitution” and theory of the “identity of
      social being and social consciousness” serve this
      reaction. It is sad, but true.
    

Materialism in general recognises objectively real being
      (matter) as independent of consciousness, sensation, experience,
      etc., of humanity. Historical materialism recognises social
      being as independent of the social consciousness of humanity. In
      both cases consciousness is only the reflection of being, at
      best an approximately true (adequate, perfectly exact)
      reflection of it. From this Marxist philosophy, which is cast
      from a single piece of steel, you cannot eliminate one basic
      premise, one essential part, without departing from objective
      truth, without falling a prey to a bourgeois-reactionary
      falsehood.
    

Here are further examples of how the dead philosophy of idealism
      lays hold of the living Marxist Bogdanov.
    

The article “What Is Idealism?” 1901
      (ibid., p. 11 et seq.): “We arrive at
      the following conclusion: both where people agree in their
      judgments of progress and where they disagree, the basic meaning
      of the idea of progress is the same, namely, increasing
      completeness and harmony of conscious life. This is the
      objective content of the concept progress. . . . If we now
      compare the psychological formulation of the idea of progress
      thus arrived at with the previously explained biological
      formulation

[“biological progress
      is an increase in the sum-total of life,”
      p. 14],

we shall easily convince ourselves that the
      former fully coincides with the latter and can be deduced from
      it. . . . And since social life amounts to the psychical life of
      members of society, here too the content of the idea of progress
      is the same—increase in the completeness and harmony of
      life; only we must add: the social life of men. And, of
      course, the idea of social progress never had and cannot have
      any other content” (p. 16).
    

      “We have found . . . that idealism expresses the victory
      in the human soul of moods more social over moods less social,
      that a progressive ideal is a reflection of the socially
      progressive tendency in the idealist psychology” (p. 32).
    
 

It need hardly be said that all this play with biology and
      sociology contains not a grain of Marxism. Both in
      Spencer and Mikhailovsky one may find any number of definitions
      not a whit worse than this, defining nothing but the “good
      intentions” of the author and betraying a complete
      lack of understanding of “what is idealism” and
      what materialism.
    

The author begins Book III of Empirio-Monism, the
      article “Social Selection (Foundations of Method),”
      1906, by refuting the “eclectic socio-biological attempts
      of Lange, Ferri, Woltmann and many others” (p. 1), and on
      page 15 we find the following conclusion of the
      “enquiry”: “We can formulate the fundamental
      connection between energetics and social selection as follows:
    

      “Every act of social selection represents an increase
      or decrease of the energy of the social complex concerned. In
      the former case we have ‘positive selection,’ in the
      latter ‘negative selection.’”
  (Author’s italics.)
    

And such unutterable trash is served out as Marxism! Can one
      imagine anything more sterile, lifeless and scholastic than this
      string of biological and energeticist terms that contribute
      nothing, and can contribute nothing, in the sphere of the social
      sciences? There is not a shadow of concrete economic enquiry
      here, not a hint of the Marxist method, the method of
      dialectics and the world outlook of materialism, only a mere
      invention of definitions and attempts to fit them into
      the ready-made conclusions of Marxism. “The rapid growth
      of the productive forces of capitalist society is undoubtedly an
      increase in the energy of the social whole. . . .” The
      second half of the phrase is undoubtedly a simple repetition of
      the first half expressed in meaningless terms which seem to lend
      “profundity” to the question, but which in reality
      in no way differ from the eclectic
      biologico-sociological attempts of Lange and
      Co.!—“but the disharmonious character of this
      process leads to its culmination in a crisis, in a vast waste of
      productive forces, in a sharp decrease of energy: positive
      selection is replaced by negative selection” (p. 18).
    

In what way does this differ from Lange? A
      biologico-energeticist label is tacked on to ready-made
      conclusions on the subject of crises, without any concrete
      material whatever being added and without the nature of crises
      being elucidated.

    

All this is done with the very best
      intentions, for the author wishes to corroborate and give
      greater depth to Marx’s conclusions; but in point of fact
      he only dilutes them with an intolerably dreary and
      lifeless scholasticism. The only “Marxism” here is a
      repetition of an already known conclusion, and all the
      “new” proof of it, all this “social
      energetics” (p. 34) and “social
      selection” is but a mere collection of words and
      a sheer mockery of Marxism.
    

Bogdanov is not engaged in a Marxist enquiry at all; all he is
      doing is to reclothe results already obtained by the Marxist
      enquiry in a biological and energeticist terminology. The whole
      attempt is worthless from beginning to end, for the concepts
      “selection,” “assimilation and
      dissimilation” of energy, the energetic balance, and so
      forth, are, when applied to the sphere of the social sciences,
      but empty phrases. In fact, an enquiry into
      social phenomena and an elucidation of the method of
      the social sciences cannot be undertaken with the aid
      of these concepts. Nothing is easier than to tack the labels of
      “energetics” or “biologico-sociology” on
      to such phenomena as crises, revolutions, the class struggle and
      so forth; but neither is there anything more sterile, more
      scholastic and lifeless than such an occupation. The important
      thing is not that Bogdanov tries to fit all his results
      and conclusions into the Marxist theory—or
      “nearly” all (we have seen the
      “correction” he made on the subject of the relation
      of social being to social consciousness)—but that the
      methods of fitting—this “social
      energetics”—are thoroughly false and in no way
      differ from the methods of Lange.
    

      “Herr Lange (On the Labour Question, etc., 2nd
      ed.),” Marx wrote to Kugelmann on June 27, 1870,
      “sings my praises loudly, but with the object of making
      himself im portant. Herr Lange, you see, has made a great
      discovery. The whole of history can be brought under a single
      great natural law. This natural law is the phrase (in
      this application Darwin’s expression becomes nothing but a
      phrase) ‘struggle for life,’ and the content of this
      phrase is the Malthusian law of population or, rather,
      over-population. So, instead of analysing the ‘struggle
      for life’ as represented historically in various definite
      forms of society, all that has to be done is to translate every
      concrete struggle into the

    

phrase ‘struggle for
      life,’ and this phrase itself into the Malthusian
      ‘population fantasy.’ One must admit that this is a
      very impressive method—for swaggering, sham-scientific,
      bombastic ignorance and intellectual
laziness.”[2]


The basis of Marx’s criticism of Lange is not that Lange
      foists Malthusianism in particular upon sociology, but that the
      transfer of biological concepts in general to the
      sphere of the social sciences is
      phrasemongering. Whether the transfer is undertaken
      with “good” intentions, or with the purpose of
      bolstering up false sociological conclusions, the phrase
      mongering none the less remains phrasemongering. And
      Bogdanov’s “social energetics,” his coupling
      of the doctrine of social selection with Marxism, is just such
      phrasemongering.
    

Just as in epistemology Mach and Avenarius did not develop
      idealism, but only overlaid the old idealist errors
      with a bombastic terminological rigmarolc
      (“elements,” “principal co-ordination,”
      “introjection,” etc.), so in sociology, even when
      there is sincere sympathy for Marxist conclusions,
      empirio-criticism results in a distortion of historical
      materialism by means of empty and bombastic energeticist and
      biological verbiage.
    

A historical peculiarity of modern Russian Machism (or rather of
      the Machian epidemic among a section of the Social-Democrats) is
      the following. Feuerbach was a “materialist below and an
      idealist above”; this to a certain extent applies also to
      Büchner, Vogt, Moleschott and Dühring, with the
      essential difference that all these philosophers were pygmies
      and wretched bunglers compared with Feuerbach.
    

Marx and Engels, as they grew out of Feuerbach and matured in
      the fight against the bunglers, naturally paid most attention to
      crowning the structure of philosophical materialism, that is,
      not to the materialist epistemology but to the materialist
      conception of history. That is why Marx and Engels laid the
      emphasis in their works rather on dialectical
      materialism than on dialectical materialism, why
      they insisted rather on historical materialism than on
      historical materialism. Our would-be Marxist Machians
      approached Marxism in an entirely different historical period,
      at a time when bourgeois philosophers were particularly
      specialising in epistemology, and, having assimilated in a

    

one-sided and mutilated form certain of the component parts of
      dialectics (relativism, for instance), directed their attention
      chiefly to a defence or restoration of idealism below and not of
      idealism above. At any rate, positivism in general, and Machism
      in particular, have been much more concerned with subtly
      falsifying epistemology, assuming the guise of materialism and
      concealing their idealism under a pseudo-materialist
      terminology, and have paid comparatively little attention to the
      philosophy of history. Our Machians did not understand Marxism
      because they happened to approach it from the other
      side, so to speak, and they have assimilated—and at
      times not so much assimilated as learnt by
      rote—Marx’s economic and historical theory, without
      clearly apprehending its foundation, viz.,
      philosophical materialism. And the result is that Bogdanov and
      Co. deserve to be called Russian Büchners and Dührings
      turned inside out. They want to be materialists above, but are
      unable to rid themselves of muddled idealism below! In the case
      of Bogdanov, “above” there is historical
      materialism, vulgarised, it is true, and much corrupted by
      idealism, “below” there is idealism, disguised in
      Marxist terminology and decked out in Marxist
      words. “Socially organised experience,”
      “collective labour process,” and so forth are
      Marxist words, but they are only words, concealing an
      idealist philosophy that declares things to be complexes of
      “elements,” of sensations, the external world to be
      “experience,” or an “empirio-symbol” of
      mankind, physical nature to be a “product” of the
      “psychical,” and so on and so forth.
    

An ever subtler falsification of Marxism, an ever subtler
      presentation of anti-materialist doctrines under the guise of
      Marxism—this is the characteristic feature of modern
      revisionism in political economy, in questions of tactics and in
      philosophy generally, both in epistemology and in sociology.

V. I.  

      Lenin
MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Six: Empirio-Criticism and Historical Materialism )
3. Suvorov’s “Foundations Of
Social Philosophy”

The Studies “in” the Philosophy of
      Marxism, the concluding article in which is the one by
      Comrade S. Suvorov mentioned above, by very reason of the
      collective nature of the book

    

constitutes an unusually potent
      bouquet. When you have at one time and side by side the
      utterances of
Bazarov,[2] who says that according to Engels
      “sense-perception is the reality existing outside
      us,” of Berman, who declares the dialectics of Marx and
      Engels to be mysticism, of Lunacharsky, who goes to the length
      of religion, of Yushkevich, who introduces “the Logos into
      the irrational stream of experience,” of Bogdanov, who
      calls idealism the philosophy of Marxism, of Helfond, who purges
      J. Dietzgen of materialism, and lastly, of S. Suvorov with his
      article “Foundations of Social Philosophy”—you
      at once get the “aroma” of the new
      alignment. Quantity has passed into quality. The
      “seekers,” who had heretofore been seeking
      separately in individual articles and books, have come out with
      a veritable pronunciamento. Individual disagreements among them
      are obliterated by the very fact of their collective appearance
      against (and not “in”) the philosophy of
      Marxism, and the reactionary features of Machism as a current
      become manifest.
    

Under these circumstances, Suvorov’s article is all the
      more interesting for the fact that the author is neither an
      empirio-monist nor an empirio-criticist, but simply a
      “realist.” What relates him, therefore, to the rest
      of the company is not what distinguishes Bazarov, Yushkevich and
      Bogdanov as philosophers, but what they all have in common
      against dialectical materialism. A comparison of the
      sociological arguments of this “realist” with the
      arguments of the empirio-monist will help us to depict their
      common tendency.
    

Suvorov writes: “In the gradation of the laws that
      regulate the world process, the particular and complex become
      reduced to the general and simple, and all of them are
      subordinate to the universal law of development—the
      law of the economy of forces. The essence of this law is
      that every system of forces is the more capable of
      conservation and development the less its expenditure,
the greater its accumulation and the more effectively
      expenditure serves accumulation. The forms of
      mobile equilibrium, which long ago evoked the idea of objective
      expediency (the solar system, the cycle of terrestrial
      phenomena, the process of life), arise and develop by virtue of
      the conservation

    

and accumulation of the energy inherent in
      them—by virtue of their intrinsic economy. The law of
      economy of forces is the unifying and regulating principle of
      all development—inorganic, biological and social”
      (p. 293, author’s italics).
    

With what remarkable ease do our “positivists” and
      “realists” turn out “universal laws”!
      What a pity these laws are no whit better than those turned out
      as easily and swiftly by Eugen Dühring. Suvorov’s
      “universal law” is just as empty and bombastic a
      phrase as Dühring’s universal laws. Try to apply this
      law to the first of the three fields mentioned by the
      author—inorganic development. You will see that no
      “economy of forces” apart from the law of the
      conservation and transformation of energy can be applied here,
      let alone applied “universally.” And the author had
      already disposed of the law of the “conservation of
      energy,” had already mentioned it (p. 292) as a separate
      law.[1]
[1]
It is characteristic that Suvorov calls
      the discovery of the law of the conservation and transformation
      of
energy[3] “the establishment of the
      basic principles of energetics” (p. 292). Has
      our would-be Marxist “realist” ever heard of the
      fact that the vulgar materialists, Büchner and Co., and the
      dialectical materialist, Engels, regarded this law as the
      establishment of the basic principles of materialism ?
      Has our “realist” ever reflected on the meaning of
      this difference? He has not: he has merely followed the fashion,
      repeated Ostwald, and that is all. That is just the trouble:
      “realists” like this succumb to fashion, while
      Engels, for instance, assimilated the, to him,
new term, energy, and began to employ it in 1885
      (Preface to the 2nd ed. of Anti-Dühring) and in
      1888 (Ludwig Feuerbach), but to employ it equally with
      the concepts “force” and “motion” and
      along with them. Engels was able to enrich his
      materialism by adopting a new terminology. The
      “realists” and other muddleheads seized upon the new
      term without noticing the difference between materialism and
      energetics!
—Lenin


What then remained in the field of inorganic
      development apart from this law? Where are the additions or
      complications, or new discoveries, or new facts which entitled
      the author to modify (“perfect”) the law of the
      conservation and transformation of energy into the law of the
      “economy of forces”? There are no such
      facts or discoveries; Suvorov does not even hint at them. He
      simply—to make it look impressive, as Turgenev’s
      Bazarov— used to say—flourished his pen and forth
      came a new “universal

    

law” of “real-monistic
      philosophy” (p. 292). That’s the stuff we are made
      of! How are we worse than Dühring?
    

Take the second field of development—the biological. In
      this field, where the development of organisms takes place by
      the struggle for existence and selection, is it the law of the
      economy of forces or the “law” of the wastage of
      forces that is universal? But never mind! “Real-monistic
      philosophy” can interpret the “meaning” of
      a universal law in one field in one way and in
      another field in another way, for instance, as the development
      of higher organisms from lower. What does it matter if
      the universal law is thus transformed into an empty
      phrase—the principle of “monism” is
      preserved. And in the third field (the social), the
      “universal law” can be interpreted in a third
      sense—as the development of productive forces. That is why
      it is a “universal law”—so that it can be made
      to cover anything you please.
    

      “Although social science is still young, it already
      possesses both a solid foundation and definite generalisations;
      in the nineteenth century it reached a theoretical
      level—and this constitutes Marx’s chief merit. He
      elevated social science to the level of a social theory



Engels said that Marx transformed socialism from
      a utopia into a science, but this is not enough for Suvorov. It
      will sound more impressive if we distinguish theory from
      science (was there a social science before Marx?)—and
      no harm is done if the distinction is absurd!.
    

      “ . . . by establishing the fundamental law of social
      dynamics according to which the evolution of productive forces
      is the determining principle of all economic and social
      development. But the development of productive forces
      corresponds to the growth of the productivity of labour, to the
      relative reduction in expenditure and the increase in the
      accumulation of energy

[see how fertile the
      “real-monistic philosophy” is: a new, energeticist,
      foundation for Marxism has been created!]...

this is the economic principle. Thus, Marx made the principle of the
      economy of forces the foundation of the social
      theory. . . .”
    

This “thus” is truly superb! Because Marx
      has a political economy, let us therefore chew the
      word “economy,” and call the cud
      “real-monistic philosophy”!
    
 

No, Marx did not make any principle of the economy of forces the
      basis of his theory. These are absurdities invented by people
      who covet the laurels of Eugen Dühring. Marx gave an
      absolutely precise definition of the concept growth of
      productive forces, and he studied the concrete process of this
      growth. But Suvorov invented a new term to designate the concept
      analysed by Marx; and his invention was a very unhappy one and
      only confused matters. For Suvorov did not explain what is meant
      by the “economy of forces,” how it can be measured,
      how this concept can be applied, precise and definite facts it
      embraces;—and this cannot be explained, because it is a
      muddle. Listen to this:
    

      “ . . . This law of social economy is not only the
      principle of the internal unity of social science

[can you make anything of this, reader?],

but also the connecting link between social theory and the
      general theory of being” (p. 294).
    

Well, well, here we have “the general theory of
      being” once more discovered by S. Suvorov, after it has
      already been discovered many times and in the most varied forms
      by numerous representatives of scholastic philosophy. We
      congratulate the Russian Machians on this new “general
      theory of being”! Let us hope that their next collective
      work will be entirely devoted to the demonstration and
      development of this great discovery!
    

The way our representative of realistic, or real-monistic,
      philosophy expounds Marx’s theory will be seen from the
      following example: “In general, the productive forces of
      men form a genetic gradation [ugh!] and consist of their labour
      energy, harnessed elemental forces, culturally modihed nature
      and the instruments of labour which make up the technique of
      production. . . . In relation to the process of labour these
      forces perform a purely economic function; they economise labour
      energy and increase the productivity of its expenditure”
      (p. 298). Productive forces perform an economic function in
      relation to the process of labour! This is just as though one
      were to say that vital forces perform a vital function in
      relation to the process of life. This is not expounding Marx;
      this is clogging up Marxism with an incredible clutter of
      words.
    
 

It is impossible to enumerate all the clutter contained in
      Suvorov’s article. “The socialisation of a class is
      expressed in the growth of its collective power over both people
      and their property” (p. 313). “ . . . The class
      struggle aims at establishing forms of equilibrium between
      social forces” (p. 322). Social dissension, enmity and
      struggle are essentially negative, anti-social
      phenomena. “Social progress, in its basic content, is the
      growth of social relations, of the social connections between
      people” (p. 328). One could fill volumes with collections
      of such banalities—and the representatives of bourgeois
      sociology are filling volumes with them. But to pass them off as
      the philosophy of Marxism—that is going too far! If
      Suvorov’s article were an experiment in popularising
      Marxism, one would not judge it very severely. Everyone would
      admit that the author’s intentions were of the best but
      that the experiment was unsuccessful. And that would be the end
      of it. But when a group of Machians present us with such stuff
      and call it the Foundations of Social Philosophy, and
      when we see the same methods of “developing” Marxism
      employed in Bogdanov’s philosophical books, we arrive at
      the inevitable conclusion that there is an intimate connection
      between reactionary epistemology and reactionary efforts in
      sociology.

Bazarov, V. (Rudnev, V. A.),
      1874-1939—philosopher and economist. From 1896 onwards
      took part in the Social-Democratic movement. In 1905-07
      collaborated on several Bolshevik publications. In the period of
      reaction (1907-10) drew away from Bolshevism; advocated
      “god-building” and empirlo-criticism; was one of the leading
      representatives of the Machist revision of Marxism.
    



[3]
The discovery of the law of the conservation and transformation
      of energy, led up to by the whole development of natural
      science, especially contributed to by the work of Lomonosov,
      occurred in the forties of the nineteenth century (the works of
      Robert Mayer, James Joule and Hermann Helmholtz). The word
      energy in its modern sense was introduced in 1853 by William
      Rankin, but it only came into general use in the seventies and
      eighties. Most physicists were at first critical of the new law,
      but its correctness was speedily proved in all spheres of
      natural science. Bagels considered this law one of the most
      important achievements of the nineteenth century and he looked
      on it as a universal law of nature expressing in the language of
      physics the unity of the material world. “The unity of all
      motion in nature,” he wrote, “is no longer a philosophical
      assertion, but a natural scientific fact” (Dialectic of
      Nature, p. 264).
    

Some scientists cast doubt on the universal nature of the law of the
      conservation and transformation of energy and tried to interpret
      it in an idealist spirit. Thus, Mach refused to regard it as a
      universal law of nature and considered that it amounted merely
      to an acknowledgement of the causal dependence of
      phenomena. Wilhelm Ostwalff regarded it as the sole universal
      law of nature and he tried to deny the objective reality of
      matter, to discard the concept of matter and to prove that
      energy exists without matter, reducing all phenomena of nature,
      society and thought to energy. A. Bogdanov tried to depict
      social changes as an increase or decrease of energy.
    

Lenin criticised “energeticism” as one of the manifestations of
      “physical idealism” and he showed the untenability in principle
      of attempts to transfer the laws of natural science to social
      phenomena. The further development of science, and study of the
      phenomena of the micro-world, confirmed the universal character
      of the law of the conservation and transformation of energy; the
      relativity theory established the universal relationship between
      energy and mass.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy

4. Parties in Philosophy and Philosophical
Blockheads

It remains for us to examine the relation between Machism and
      religion. But this broadens into the question of whether there
      are parties generally in philosophy, and what is meant by
      non-partisanship in philosophy.
    

Throughout the preceding exposition, in connection with every
      problem of epistemology touched upon and in connection with
      every philosophical question raised by the new physics, we
      traced the struggle between materialism and
      idealism. Behind the mass of new terminological
      devices, behind the litter of erudite scholasticism, we
      invariably discerned two principal alignments, two
      fundamental trends in the solution of philosophical
      problems. Whether nature, matter, the physical, the external
      world should be taken as primary, and consciousness, mind,

    

sensation (experience—as the widespread
      terminology of our time has it), the psychical, etc., should be
      regarded as secondary—that is the root question which
      in fact continues to divide the philosophers into
      two great camps. The source of thousands upon thousands
      of errors and of the confusion reigning in this sphere is the
      fact that beneath the envelope of terms, definitions, scholastic
      devices and verbal artihces, these two fundamental trends are
      overlooked. (Bogdanov, for instance, refuses to
      acknowledge his idealism, because, you see, instead of the
      “metaphysical” concepts “nature” and
      “mind,” he has taken the “experiential”:
      physical and psychical. A word has been changed!)
    

The genius of Marx and Engels consisted in the very fact that in
      the course of a long period, nearly half a century,
      they developed materialism, that they further advanced one
      fundamental trend in philosophy, that they did not stop at
      reiterating epistemological problems that had already been
      solved, but consistently applied—and showed how
      to apply—this same materialism in the sphere of
      the social sciences, mercilessly brushing aside as litter and
      rubbish the pretentious rigmarole, the innumerable attempts to
      “discover” a “new” line in philosophy,
      to invent a “new” trend and so forth. The verbal
      nature of such attempts, the scholastic play with new
      philosophical “isms,” the clogging of the issue by
      pretentious devices, the inability to comprehend and clearly
      present the struggle between the two fundamental epistemological
      trends—this is what Marx and Engels persistently pursued
      and fought against throughout their entire activity.
    

We said, “nearly half a century.” And, indeed, as
      far back as 1843, when Marx was only becoming Marx,
      i.e., the founder of scientific socialism, the founder
      of modern materialism, which is immeasurably richer in
      content and in comparably more consistent than all preceding
      forms of materialism, even at that time Marx pointed out with
      amazing clarity the basic trends in philosophy. Karl Grün
      quotes a letter from Marx to Feuerbach dated October 20,
      1843,[8] in which Marx invites Feuerbach to
      write an article for the Deutsch-Französische
      Jahrbücher[9] against Schelling. This Schelling,
      writes Marx, is a shallow braggart with his claims to having
      embraced and transcended

    

all previous philosophical
      trends. “To the French romanticists and mystics he
      [Schelling] says: I am the union of philosophy and theology; to
      the French materialists: I am the union of the flesh and the
      idea; to the French sceptics: I am the destroyer of
      dogmatism.”[1]

That the “sceptics,”
      be they called Humeans or Kantians (or, in the twentieth
      century, Machians), cry out against the “dogmatism”
      of both materialism and idealism, Marx at that time already
      realised; and, without letting himself be diverted by any one of
      a thousand wretched little philosophical systems, he was able
      through Feuerbach to take the direct materialist road as against
      idealism. Thirty years later, in the afterword to the second
      edition of the first volume of Capital, Marx just as
      clearly and definitely contrasted his materialism to
      Hegel’s idealism, the most consistent and
      developed idealism of all; he contemptuously brushed Comtean
      “positivism” aside and dubbed as wretched epigoni
      the contemporary philosophers who imagined that they had
      destroyed Hegel when in reality they had reverted to a
      repetition of the pre-Hegelian errors of Kant and
Hume.[10] In the
      letter to Kugelmann of June 27, 1870, Marx refers just as
      contemptuously to “Büchner, Lange, Dühring,
      Fechner, etc.,” because they understood nothing of
      Hegel’s dialectics and treated him with
scorn.[2]

And finally, take the
      various philosophical utterances by Marx in Capital and
      other works, and you will find an invariable basic
      motif, viz., insistence upon materialism and
      contemptuous derision of all obscurity, of all confusion and all
      deviations towards idealism. All Marx’s
      philosophical utterances revolve within these two fundamental
      opposites, and, in the eyes of professorial philosophy, their
      defect lies in this “narrowness” and
      “one-sidedness.” As a matter of fact, this refusal
      to recognise the hybrid projests for reconciling materialism and
      idealism

    

constitutes the great merit of Marx, who moved
      forward along a sharply-dehned philosophical road.
    

Entirely in the spirit of Marx, and in close collaboration with
      him, Engels in all his philosophical works briefly and clearly
      contrasts the materialist and idealist lines in regard to
      all questions, without, either in 1878, or 1888, or
      1892,[11] taking seriously the endless
      attempts to “transcend” “one-sidedness”
      of materialism and idealism, to proclaim a new
      trend—“positivism,” “realism,” or
      some other professorial charlatanism. Engels based his
      whole fight against Dühring on the demand for
      consistent adherence to materialism, accusing the materialist
      Dühring of verbally confusing the issue, of
      phrasemongering, of methods of reasoning which involved a
      compromise with idealism and adoption of the position of
      idealism. Either materialism consistent to the end, or the
      falsehood and confusion of philosophical idealism—such is
      the formulation of the question given in every
      paragraph of Anti-Dühring ; and only people
      whose minds had already been corrupted by reactionary
      professorial philosophy could fail to notice it. And right down
      to 1894, when the last preface was written to
      Anti-Dühring, revised and enlarged by the author
      for the last time, Engels continued to follow the latest
      developments both in philosophy and science, and continued with
      all his former resoluteness to hold to his lucid and firm
      position, brushing away the litter of new systems, big and
      little.
    

That Engels followed the new developments in philosophy is
      evident from Ludwig Feuerbach. In the 1888 preface,
      mention is even made of such a phenomenon as the rebirth of
      classical German philosophy in England and Scandinavia, whereas
      Engels (both in the preface and in the text of the book) has
      nothing but the most extreme contempt for the prevailing
      Neo-Kantianism and Humism. It is quite obvious that Engels,
      observing the repetition by fashionable German and
      English philosophy of the old pre-Hegelian errors of Kantianism
      and Humism, was prepared to expect some good even from the
      turn to Hegel (in England and Scandinavia), hoping that the
      great idealist and dialectician would help to disclose petty
      idealist and metaphysical
errors.[12]

 

Without undertaking an examination of the vast number of shades
      of Neo-Kantianism in Germany and of Humism in England, Engels
      from the very outset refutes their fundamental
      deviation from materialism. Engels declares that the entire
      tendency of these two schools is “scientifically
      a step backward.” And what is his opinion of the
      undoubtedly “positivist,” according to the current
      terminology, the undoubtedly “realist” tendencies of
      these Neo-Kantians and Humeans, among whose number, for
      instance, he could not help knowing Huxley? That
      “positivism” and that “realism” which
      attracted, and which continue to attract, an infinite number of
      muddleheads, Engels declared to be atb e s ta philistine
      method of smuggling in materialism while abusing and
      abjuring it publicly! One has to reflect only very little on
      such an appraisal of Thomas Huxley—a very great
      scientist and an incomparably more realistic realist and
      positive positivist than Mach, Avenarius and Co.—in order
      to understand how contemptuously Engels would have greeted the
      present infatuation of a group of Marxists with “recent
      positivism,” the “latest realism,” etc.
    

Marx and Engels were partisans in philosophy from start to
      finish, they were able to detect the deviations from materialism
      and concessions to idealism and fideism in each and every
      “new” tendency. They therefore appraised Huxley
      exclusively from the standpoint of his materialist
      consistency. They therefore rebuked Feuerbach for not pursuing
      materialism to the end, for renouncing materialism because of
      the errors of individual materialists, for combating religion in
      order to renovate it or invent a new religion, for being unable,
      in sociology, to rid himself of idealist phraseology and become
      a materialist.
    

And whatever particular mistakes he committed in his exposition
      of dialectical materialism, J. Dietzgen fully appreciated and
      took over this great and most precious tradition of his
      teachers. Dietzgen sinned much by his clumsy deviations from
      materialism, but he never attempted to dissociate himself from
      it in principle, he never attempted to hoist a “new”
      standard and always at the decisive moment he firmly and
      categorically declared: I am a materialist; our philosophy is a
      materialist philosophy. “Of all parties,” our Joseph
      Dietzgen justly said, “the middle

    

party is the most
      repulsive. . . . Just as parties in politics are more and more
      becoming divided into two camps . . . so science too is being
      divided into two general classes (Generalklassen):
      metaphysicians on the one hand, and physicists, or materialists,
      on the
other.[3]

The intermediate elements and
      conciliatory quacks, with their various
      appellations—spiritualists, sensationalists, realists,
      etc., etc.—fall into the current on their way. We aim at
      definiteness and clarity. The reactionaries who sound a retreat
      (Retraiteblaser) call themselves
idealists,[4]

and materialists should be the name for all who are striving to
      liberate the human mind from the metaphysical spell. . . . If we
      compare the two parties respectively to solid and liquid,
      between them there is a
mush.”[5]


True! The “realists,” etc., including the
      “positivists,” the Machians, etc., are all a
      wretched mush; they are a contemptible middle party in
      philosophy, who confuse the materialist and idealist trends on
      every question. The attempt to escape these two basic trends in
      philosophy is nothing but “conciliatory quackery.”
    

J. Dietzgen had not the slightest doubt that the
      “scientific priestcraft” of idealist philosophy is
      simply the antechamber to open priestcraft. “Scientific
      priestcraft,” he wrote, “is seriously endeavouring
      to assist religious priestcraft” (op. cit.,
      p. 51). “In particular, the sphere of epistemology, the
      misunderstanding of the human mind, is such a louse-hole”
      (Lausgrube) in which both kinds of priests “lay
      their eggs.” “Graduated flunkeys,” who with
      their talk of “ideal blessings” stultify the people
      by their tortuous (geschraubte) “idealism”
      (p. 53)—that is J. Dietzgen’s opinion of the
      professors of philosophy. “Just as the antipodes of the
      good God is the devil, so the professorial priest
      (Kathederpfaffen) has his opposite pole in the
      materialist.” The materialist theory of knowledge is
      “a universal weapon against religious

    

belief”
      (p. 55), and not only against the “notorious, formal and
      common religion of the priests, but also against the most
      refined, elevated professorial religion of muddled
      (benebelter) idealists” (p. 58).
    

Dietzgen was ready to prefer “religious honesty” to
      the “half-heartedness” of freethinking professors
      (p. 60), for “there at least there is a system,”
      there we find integral people, people who do not separate theory
      from practice. For the Herr Professors “philosophy is not
      a science, but a means of defence against Social-Democracy
      . . .” (p. 107). “All who call themselves
      philosophers, professors, and university lecturers are, despite
      their apparent freethinking, more or less immersed in
      superstition and mysticism . . . and in relation to
      Social-Democracy constitute a single . . . reactionary
      mass” (p. 108). “Now, in order to follow the true
      path, without being led astray by all the religious and
      philosophical gibberish (Welsch), it is necessary to
      study the falsest of all false paths (der Holzweg der
      Holzwege), philosophy” (p. 103).
    

Let us now examine Mach, Avenarius and their school from the
      standpoint of parties in philosophy. Oh, these gentlemen
      boast of their non-partisanship, and if they
      have an antipodes, it is the materialist . . . and
      only the materialist. A red thread that runs through
      all the writings of all the Machians is the
      stupid claim to have “risen above” materialism and
      idealism, to have transcended this “obsolete”
      antithesis; but in fact the whole fraternity are
      continually sliding into idealism and are conducting a
      steady and incessant struggle against materialism. The subtle
      epistemological crotchets of a man like Avenarius are but
      professorial inventions, an attempt to form a small
      philosophical sect “of his own”; but, as a
      matter of fact, in the general circumstances of the
      struggle of ideas and trends in modern society, the
      objective part played by these epistemological
      artifices is in every case the same, namely, to clear the way
      for idealism and fideism, and to serve them faithfully. In fact,
      it cannot be an accident that the small school of
      empirio-criticists is acclaimed by the English spiritualists,
      like Ward, by the French neo-criticists, who praise Mach for his
      attack on materialism, and by the German immanentists!
      Dietzgen’s expression, “graduated flunkeys of
      fideism,” hits

    

the nail on the head in the case of Mach,
      Avenarius and their whole
school.[6]
[6]
Here is
      another example of how the widespread currents of reactionary
      bourgeois philosophy make use of Machism in practice. Perhaps
      the “latest fashion” in the latest American
      philosophy is
“pragmatism”[15] (from the Greek word
      “pragm”—action; that is, a philosophy of
      action). The philosophical journals perhaps speak more of
      pragmatism than of anything else. Pragmatism ridicules the
      metaphysics both of idealism and materialism, acclaims
      expericnce and only experience, recognises practice as the only
      criterion, refers to the positivist movement in general,
      especially turns for support to Ostwald, Mach,
Pearson, Poincaré and Duhem for
      the belief that scicnce is not an “absolute copy of
      reality” and . . . succcssfully deduces from all this a
      God for practical purposes, and only for practical purposes,
      without any metaphysics, and without transcending the bounds of
      experience (cf. William James, Pragmatism. A New
      Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking, New York and London,
      1907, pp. 57 and 106 especially). From the standpoint of
      materialism the difference between Machism and pragmatism is as
      insignificant and unimportant as the difference between
      empirio-criticism and empirio-monism. Compare, for example,
      Bogdanov’s definition of truth with the pragmatist
      definition of truth, which is: “Truth for a pragmatist
      becomes a class-name for all sorts of definite working values in
      expericnce” (ibid., p. 68).
—Lenin



It is the misfortune of the Russian Machians, who under took to
      “reconcile” Machism and Marxism, that they trusted
      the reactionary professors of philosophy and as a result slipped
      down an inclined plane. The methods of operation employed in the
      various attempts to develop and supplement Marx were not very
      ingenious. They read Ostwald, believe Ostwald, paraphrase
      Ostwald and call it Marxism. They read Mach, believe Mach,
      paraphrase Mach and call it Marxism. They read Poincaré,
      believe Poincaré, paraphrase Poincaré and call it
      Marxism! Not a single one of these professors, who are
      capable of making very valuable contributions in the special
      fields of chemistry, history, or physics, can be trusted one
      iota when it comes to philosophy. Why? For the same reason
      that not a single professor of political economy, who
      may be capable of very valuable contributions in the field of
      factual and specialised investigations, can be trusted one
      iota when it comes to the general theory of political
      economy. For in modern society the latter is as much a
      partisan science as is epistemology. Taken as
      a whole, the professors of economics are nothing but learned

    

salesmen of the capitalist class, while the professors of
      philosophy are learned salesmen of the theologians.
    

The task of Marxists in both cases is to be able to master and
      adapt the achievements of these “salesmen” (for
      instance, you will not make the slightest progress in the
      investigation of new economic phenomena unless you have recourse
      to the works of these salesmen) and to be able to lop
      off their reactionary tendency, to pursue your own line
      and to combat the whole alignment of forces and classes
      hostile to us. And this is just what our Machians were unable to
      do, they slavishly follow the lead of the reactionary
      professorial philosophy. “Perhaps we have gone astray, but
      we are seeking,” wrote Lunacharsky in the name of the
      authors of the Studies. The trouble is that it is not
      you who are seeking, but you who are being
      sought ! You do not go with your, i.e., Marxist
      (for you want to be Marxists), standpoint to every change in the
      bourgeois philosophical fashion; the fashion comes to you,
      foists upon you its new surrogates got up in the idealist taste,
      one day à la Ostwald, the next day à
      la Mach, and the day after à la
      Poincaré. These silly “theoretical” devices
      (“energetics,” “elements,”
      “introjections,” etc.) in which you so naïvely
      believe are confined to a narrow and tiny school, while the
      ideological and social tendency of these devices is
      immediately spotted by the Wards, the neo-criticists, the
      immanentists, the Lopatins and the pragmatists, and it
      serves their purposes. The infatuation for
      empirio-criticism and “physical” idealism passes as
      rapidly as the infatuation for Neo-Kantianism and
      “physiological” idealism; but fideism takes its toll
      from every such infatuation and modihes its devices in a
      thousand ways for the benefit of philosophical idealism.
    

The attitude towards religion and the attitude towards natural
      science excellently illustrate the actual class use
      made of empirio-criticism by bourgeois reactionaries.
    

Take the first question. Do you think it is an accident that in
      a collective work directed against the philosophy of
      Marxism Lunacharsky went so far as to speak of the
      “deification of the higher human potentialities,” of
      “religious atheism,”
etc.?[7]

If you do,
      it is only because the

    

Russian Machians have not informed the
      public correctly regarding the whole Machian current in
      Europe and the attitude of this current to religion. Not only is
      this attitude in no way similar to the attitude of Marx, Engels,
      J. Dietzgen and even Feuerbach, but it is the very
      opposite, beginning with Petzoldt’s statement to the
      effect that empirio-criticism “contradicts neither theism
      nor atheism” (Einführung in die Philosophie der
      reinen Erfahrung, Bd. I, S. 351), or Mach’s
      declaration that “religious opinion is a private
      affair” (French trans., p. 434), and ending with the
      explicit fideism, the explicitly
      arch-reactionary views of Cornelius, who praises Mach
      and whom Mach praises, of Carus and of all the immanentists. The
      neutrality of a philosopher in this question is in
      itself servility to fideism, and Mach and Avenarius,
      because of the very premises of their epistemology, do not and
      cannot rise above neutrality.
    

Once you deny objective reality, given us in sensation, you have
      already lost every one of your weapons against fideism, for you
      have slipped into agnosticism or subjectivism—and that is
      all fideism wants. If the perceptual world is objective reality,
      then the door is closed to every other “reality” or
      quasi-reality (remember that Bazarov believed the
      “realism” of the immanentists, who declare God to be
      a “real concept”). If the world is matter in motion,
      matter can and must be infinitely studied in the infinitely
      complex and detailed manifestations and ramifications of
      this motion, the motion of this matter; but
      beyond it, beyond the “physical,” external world,
      with which everyone is familiar, there can be nothing. And the
      hostility to materialism and the showers of abuse heaped on the
      materialists are all in the order of things in civilised and
      democratic Europe. All this is going on to this day. All this is
      being concealed from the public by the Russian
      Machians, who have not once attempted even simply to
      compare the attacks made on materialism by Mach, Avenarius,
      Petzoldt and Co., with the statements made in favour of
      materialism by Feuerbach, Marx, Engels and J. Dietzgen.
    

But this “concealment” of the attitude of Mach and
      Avenarius to fideism will not avail. The facts speak for

    

themselves. No efforts can release these reactionary professors
      from the pillory in which they have been placed by the kisses of
      Ward, the neo-criticists, Schuppe, Schubert-Soldern, Leclair,
      the pragmatists, etc. And the influence of the persons
      mentioned, as philosophers and professors, the popularity of
      their ideas among the “educated,” i.e., the
      bourgeois, public and the specific literature they have created
      are ten times wider and richer than the particular little school
      of Mach and Avenarius. The little school serves those it should
      serve, and it is exploited as it deserves to be exploited.
    

The shameful things to which Lunacharsky has stooped are not
      exceptional; they are the product of empirio-criticism, both
      Russian and German. They cannot be defended on the grounds of
      the “good intentions” of the author, or the
      “special meaning” of his words; if it were the
      direct and common, i.e., the directly fideistic
      meaning, we should not stop to discuss matters with the author,
      for most likely not a single Marxist could be found in whose
      eyes such statements would not have placed Anatole
      Lunacharsky exactly in the same category as Peter
      Struve. If this is not the case (and it is not the case
      yet), it is exclusively because we perceive the
      “special” meaning and are fighting while there
      is still ground for a fight on comradely lines. This is
      just the disgrace of Lunacharsky’s statements—that
      he could connect them with his “good”
      intentions. This is just the evil of his
      “theory”—that it permits the use of
      such methods or of such conclusions in the
      pursuit of good intentions. This is just the trouble—that
      at best “good” intentions are the
      subjective affair of Tom, Dick or Harry, while the social
      significance of such statements is undeniable and
      indisputable, and no reservation or explanation can mitigate
      it.
    

One must be blind not to see the ideological affinity beiween
      Lunacharsky’s “deification of the higher human
      potentialities” and Bogdanov’s “general
      substitution” of the psychical for all physical
      nature. This is one and the same thought; in the one case it is
      expressed principally from the aesthetic standpoint, and in the
      other from the epistemological
      standpoint. “Substitution,” approaching the subject
      taciitly and from a different angle, already
      deifies
    

the “higher human potentialities,” by
      divorcing the “psychical” from man and by
      substituting an immensely extended, abstract, divinely-lifeless
      “psychical in general” for all physical
      nature. And what of Yushkevich’s “Logos”
      introduced into the “irrational stream of
      experience”?
    

A single claw ensnared, and the bird is lost. And our Machians
      have all become ensnared in idealism, that is, in a diluted and
      subtle fideism; they became ensnared from the moment they took
      “sensation” not as an image of the external world
      but as a special “element.” It is nobody’s
      sensation, nobody’s mind, nobody’s spirit,
      nobody’s will—this is what one inevitably comes to
      if one does not recognise the materialist theory that the human
      mind reflects an objectively real external world.

The turn to Hegel in the second half of the nineteenth century
      was characteristic of the development of bourgeois philosophy in
      a number of European countries and the U.S.A. In Britain it
      began with the appearance in 1865 of James Hutchison Stirling’s
      book The Secret of Hegel. The bourgeois ideologists
      were attracted by Hegel’s absolute idealism, which offered wide
      opportunities for a theoretical justification of religion. There
      developed a special philosophical trend which was given the name
      of Anglo-Hegelianism, whose representatives (Thomas Green, the
      brothers Edward and John Caird, Francis Bradley and others)
      vigorously at tacked materialism, making use of the reactionary
      aspects of Hegel’s doctrine.
    

In the Scandinavian countries, too, Hegelian philosophy became
      more influential in the second half of the eighteenth
      century. In Sweden its revival was sponsored by Johann Borelius
      who counterposed Hegelianism to the prevailing
      subjective-idealist philosophy. In Norway the Right-wing
      Hegelians Marcus Jacob Monrad, G. W. Ling and others interpreted
      Hegel’s philosophy in the spirit of mysticism, discarding its
      rationalism and trying to sub ordinate science to religion. In
      Denmark, where Hegelian philosophy

   

began to spread even during
      Hegel’s lifetime, it was criticised from the same standpoint.
    

The spread of Hegel’s philosophy did not lead to its revival;
      the bourgeois epigones of Hegel “developed” (mainly in the
      spirit of subjective idealism) various aspects of his
      conservative philosophical system.. All this paved the way for
      the emergence at the turn of the century of neo-Hegelian—a
      reactionary trend of bourgeois philosophical thought in the
      imperialist era that attempted to adapt Hegel’s philosophy to
      fascist ideology.
    



[15]
Pragmatism—a subjective-idealist trend of
      bourgeois (mainly American) philosophy in the imperialist
      era. It arose in the seven ties. of the last century in the
      U.S.A. as a reflection of specific features of the development
      of American capitalism, replacing the hitherto prevailing
      religious philosophy. The main propositions of pragmatism were
      formulated by Charles Peirce. As an independent philosophical
      tendency it took shape at the turn of the century in the works
      of William James and Ferdinand Schiller and was further
      developed in the instrumentalism of John Dewey.
    

The pragmatists consider that the central problem of philosophy
      is the attainment of true knowledge. However, they completely
      distort the very concept of truth; already Peirce looked on
      cognition as a purely psychological, subjective process of
      achieving religious belief. James substituted the concept of
      “usefulness”, of success or advantage, for the concept of truth,
      i.e., for the objectively true reflection of reality. From his
      point of view, all concepts, including religious ones, are true
      insofar as they are useful. Dewey went, even farther by
      declaring all scientific theories, all moral principles and
      social institutions, to be merely “instruments” for the
      attainment of the personal aims of the individual. As the
      criterion of the “truth” (usefulness) of knowledge, the
      pragmatists take experience, understood not as human social
      practice but as the constant stream of individual experiences,
      of the subjective phenomena of consciousness; they regard this
      experience as the solo reality, declaring the concepts of matter
      and mind “obsolete”. Like the Machists, the pragmatists claim to
      have created a “third line” in philosophy; they try to place
      themselves above materialism and idealism, while in fact
      advocating one of the varieties of idealism. In contrast to
      materialist monism, the pragmatists put forward the standpoint
      of “pluralism”, according to which there is no internal
      connection, no conformity to law, in the universe; it is like a
      mosaic which each person builds in his own way, out of his own
      individual experiences. Hence, starting out from the needs of
      the given moment, pragmatism considers it possible to give
      different, even contradictory, explanations of one and the same
      phenomenon. Consistency is declared to be unnecessary; if it is
      to a man’s advantage, he can be a determinist or an
      indeterminist, he can assert or deny the existence of God, and
      so on.
    

By basing themselves on the subjective-idealist tradition of
      English philosophy from Berkeley and Hume to John Stuart Mill,
      by exploiting particular aspects of the theories of Kant,
      Mach

   

and Avenarius, Nietzsche and Henri Bergson, the American
      pragmatists created one of the most reactionary philosophical
      trends of modern times, a convenient form for theoretically
      defending the interests of the imperialist bourgeoisie. It is
      for this reason that pragmatism spread so widely in the U.S.A.,
      becoming almost the official American philosophy. There have
      been advocates of pragmatism at various times in Italy, Germany,
      France, Czechoslovakia and other countries.

MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

( Chapter Six: Empirio-Criticism and Historical Materialism )
5. Ernst Haeckel and Ernst Mach

Let us now examine the attitude of Machism, as a
      philosophical current, towards the natural
      sciences. All Machism, from beginning to end, combats
      the “metaphysics” of the natural sciences, this
      being the name they give to natural-scientific
      materialism, i.e., to the instinctive, unwitting,
      unformed, philosophically unconscious conviction shared by the
      overwhelming majority of scientists regarding the objective
      reality of the external world reflected by our
      consciousness. And our Machians maintain a skulking silence
      regarding this fact and obscure or confuse the
      inseparable connection between the instinctive
      materialism of the natural scientists and philosophical
      materialism as a trend, a trend known long ago and hundreds
      of times affirmed by Marx and Engels.
    

Take Avenarius. In his very first work, Philosophie als
      Denken der Welt gemäss dem Prinzip des kleinsten
      Kraftmasses, published in 1876, he attacked the metaphysics
      of the natural sciences,[§ 79, 114,etc.] i.e.,
      natural-scientific materialism, and, as he himself admitted in
      1891 (without, however, “correcting” his views!),
      attacked it from the standpoint of epistemological idealism.
    
 

Take Mach. From 1872 (or even earlier) down to 1906 he waged
      continuous war on the metaphysics of natural science. However,
      he was conscientious enough to admit that his views were shared
      by “a number of philosophers” (the immanentists
      included), but by “very few scientists”
      (Analysis of Sensations, p. 9). In 1906 Mach also
      honestly admitted that the “majority of scientists adhere
      to materialism” (Erkenntnis und Irrtum, 2. Aufl.,
      S. 4).
    

Take Petzoldt. In 1900 he proclaimed that the “natural
      sciences are thoroughly (ganz und gar) imbued with
      metaphysics.” “Their ‘experience’ has
      still to be purified” (Einführung in die
      Philosophie der reinen Erfahrung, Bd. I, S. 343). We know
      that Avenarius and Petzoldt “purify” experience of
      all recognition of the objective reality given us in
      sensation. In 1904 Petzoldt declared: “The mechanical
      world outlook of the modern scientist is essentially no better
      than that of the ancient Indians. . . . It makes no difference
      whether the world rests on a mythical elephant or on just as
      mythical a swarm of molecules and atoms epistemologically
      thought of as real and therefore not used merely metaphorically
      (bloss bildlich)” (Bd. II, S. 176).
    

Take Willy, the only Machian decent enough to be ashamed of his
      kinship with the immanentists. Yet, in 1905 he too declared:
      “. . . The natural sciences, after all, are also in many
      respects an authority of which we must rid ourselves”
      (Gegen die Schulweisheit, S. 158).
    

But this is all sheer obscurantism, out-and-out
      reaction. To regard atoms, molecules, electrons, etc., as an
      approximately true reflection in our mind of the objectively
      real movement of matter is equivalent to believing in an
      elephant upon which the world rests! No wonder that this
      obscurantist, decked in the cap and bells of
      fashionable positivism, was greeted by the immanentists with
      open arms. There is not a single immanentist who
      would not furiously attack the “metaphysics” of
      science, the “materialism” of the scientists,
      precisely because of the recognition by the scientists
      of the objective reality of matter (and its particles), time,
      space, laws of nature, etc., etc. Long before the new
      discoveries in physics which gave rise to “physical
      idealism” were made, Leclair, using Mach as a support,

    

combated “The Predominant Materialist Trend
      (Grundzug) of Modern Science” (the title of
      § 6 of Der Realismus usw., 1879), Schubert-Soldern
      fought “The Metaphysics of Natural Science” (the
      title of Chapter II of Grundlagen einer
      Erkenntnistheorie, 1884) Rehmke battled with
      natural-scientific “materialism,” that
      “metaphysics of the street”
      (Philosophie und Kantianismus, 1882, S. 17), etc.,
      etc.
    

And the immanentists quite legitimately drew direct and
      outspoken fideist conclusions from this Machian
      idea of the “metaphysical character” of
      natural-scientific materialism. If natural science in its
      theories depicts not objective reality, but only
      metaphors, symbols, forms of human experience etc., it is beyond
      dispute that humanity is entitled to create for itself in
      another sphere no less “real
      concepts,” such as God, and so forth.
    

The philosophy of the scientist Mach is to science what the kiss
      of the Christian Judas was to Christ. Mach likewise betrays
      science into the hands of fideism by virtually deserting to the
      camp of philosophical idealism. Mach’s renunciation of
      natural-scientific materialism is a reactionary phenomenon in
      every respect. We saw this quite clearly when we spoke of the
      struggle of the “physical idealists” against the
      majority of scientists, who continue to maintain the
      standpoint of the old philosophy. We shall see it still more
      clearly if we compare the eminent scientist, Ernst Haeckel, with
      the eminent (among the reactionary philistines) philosopher,
      Ernst Mach.
    

The storm provoked by Ernst Haeckel’s The Riddle of
      the Universe in every civilised country strikingly brought
      out, on the one hand, the partisan character of
      philosophy in modern society and, on the other, the true social
      significance of the struggle of materialism against idealism and
      agnosticism. The fact that the book was sold in hundreds of
      thousands of copies, that it was immediately translated
      into all languages and that it appeared in specially cheap
      editions, clearly demonstrates that the book “has found
      its way to the masses,” that there are multitudes of
      readers whom Ernst Haeckel at once won over to his side. This
      popular little book became a weapon in the class struggle. The
      professors of philosophy and theology in every country of the
      world set about denouncing and annihilating Haeckel

    

in every
      possible way. The eminent English physicist Lodge hastened to
      defend God against Haeckel. The Russian physicist Mr. Chwolson
      went to Germany to publish a vile reactionary pamphlet attacking
      Haeckel and to assure the respectable philistines that not all
      scientists now hold the position of “naïve
      realism.”[1]

There is no
      counting the theologians who joined the campaign against
      Haeckel. There was no abuse not showered on him by the official
      professors of
philosophy.[2]

It was amusing to see how—perhaps for
      the first time in their lives—the eyes of these mummies,
      dried and shrunken in the atmosphere of lifeless scholasticism,
      began to gleam and their cheeks to glow under the slaps which
      Haeckel administered them. The high-priests of pure science,
      and, it would appear, of the most abstract theory, fairly
      groaned with rage. And throughout all the howling of the
      philosophical diehards (the idealist Paulsen, the immanentist
      Rehmke, the Kantian Adickes, and the others whose name, god wot,
      is legion) one underlying motif is clearly discernible: they are
      all against the “metaphysics” of science,
      against “dogmatism,” against “the exaggeration
      of the value and significance of science,” against
      “natural-scientific materialism.” He is a
      materialist—at him! at the materialist! He is deceiving
      the public by not calling him self a materialist
      directly!—that is what particularly incenses the worthy
      professors.
    

And the noteworthy thing in all this
tragi-comedy[3]
[3]
The tragic element was introduced by the attempt
      made on Haeckel’s life this spring (1908). After Haeckel
      had received a number of anonymous letters addressing him by
      such epithets as “dog,” “atheist,”
      “monkey,” and so forth, some true German soul threw
      a stone of no mean size through the window of Haeckel’s
      study in Jena.
—Lenin


is the fact that Haeckel himself
      renounces materialism and rejects the appellation. What
      is more, far from rejecting religion altogether, he has invented
      his own religion (something like Bulgakov’s
      “atheistic faith” or Lunacharsky’s
      “religious atheism”), and on grounds of
      principle
    

advocates a union of religion and
      science. What then is it all about? What “fatal
      misunderstanding” started the row?
    

The point is that Haeckel’s philosophical naïvete,
      his lack of definite partisan aims, his anxiety to respect the
      prevailing philistine prejudice against materialism, his
      personal conciliatory tendencies and proposals concerning
      religion, all this gave the greater salience to the general
      spirit of his book, the ineradicability of
      natural-scientific materialism and its
      irreconcilability with all official
      professorial philosophy and theology. Haeckel personally does
      not seek a rupture with the philistines, but what he expounds
      with such unshakeably naïve conviction is
      absolutely incompatible with any of the shades of
      prevailing philosophical idealism. All these shades, from the
      crudest reactionary theories of a Hartmann, to Petzoldt, who
      fancies himself the latest, most progressive and advanced of the
      positivists, and the empirio-criticist Mach—all
      are agreed that natural-scientific materialism is
      “metaphysics,” that the recognition of an objective
      reality underlying the theories and conclusions of science is
      sheer “naïve realism,” etc. And for this
      doctrine, “sacred” to all professorial
      philosophy and theology, every page of Haeckel is a slap in
      the face. This scientist, who undoubtedly expressed the
      very firmly implanted, although unformed opinions, sentiments
      and tendencics of the overwhelming majority of the scientists of
      the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth
      century, instantly, easily and simply revealed what professorial
      philosophy tried to conceal from the public and from itself,
      namely, the fact that there is a foundation, growing ever wider
      and firmer, which shatters all the efforts and strivings of the
      thousand and one little schools of philosophical idealism,
      positivism, realism, empirio-criticism and other
      confusionism. This foundation is natural-scientific
      materialism. The conviction of the “naïve
      realists” (in other words, of all humanity) that our
      sensations are images of an objectively real external world is
      the conviction of the mass of scientists, one that is steadily
      growing and gaining in strength.
    

The cause of the founders of new philosophical schools and of
      the inventors of new epistemological “isms” is

    



lost,
      irrevocably and hopelessly. They may flounder about in their
      “original” petty systems; they may strive to engage
      the attention of a few admirers in the interesting controversy
      as to who was the first to exclaim, “Eh!”—the
      empirio-critical Bobchinsky, or the empirio-monistic
      Dobchinsky[8]; they may even devote themselves to
      creating an extensive “special” literature, like the
      “immanentists.” But the course of development of
      science, despite its vacillations and hesitations, despite the
      unwitting character of the materialism of the scientists,
      despite yesterday’s infatuation with fashionable
      “physiological idealism” or today’s
      infatuation with fashionable “physical idealism,” is
      sweeping aside all the petty systems and artifices and
      once again bringing to the forefront the
      “metaphysics” of natural-scientific
      materialism.
    

Here is an illustration of this from Haeckel. In his The
      Wonders of Life, Haeckel compares the monistic and
      dualistic theories of knowledge. We give the most interesting
      points of the
comparison[4]

:

    


 THE MONISTIC THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 
 THE DUALISTIC THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 


3. Cognition is a physiological process, whose anatomical
    organ is the brain
3. Cognition is not a physiological but a purely spiritual
    process.


4. The only part of the human brain in which knowledge
    is engendered is a spatially limited sphere of the cortex the
    phronema. 
4. The part of the human brain which appears to function as
    the organ of knowledge is in fact only the instrument that
    permits the spiritual process to manifest
    itself. 


5. The phronema is a highly perfected dynamo,

    

the
    individual parts of which,thephroneta, consist of millions of
    cells (phronetal cells). Just as in the case of every other
    organ of the body, so in the case of this mental organ, its
    function, the “mind,” is the sum-total of the
    functions of its constituent cells. 
5. The phronema as the organof reason is not
    autonomous, but,  through its constituent
    parts(phroneta)and the cells that com- pose them, serves
    only as intermediary between the non-material mind and the
    external world. Human reason differs absolutely from the
    mind of the higher animal sand from the instinct of the
    lower animals. 



This typical quotation from his works shows that Haeckel does
      not attempt an analysis of philosophical problems and is not
      able to contrast the materialist theory of knowledge with the
      idealist theory of knowledge. He ridicules all
      idealist—more broadly, all peculiarly
      philosophical—artifices from the standpoint of natural
      science, without even permitting the idea that any
      other theory of knowledge but natural-scientific
      materialism is possible. He ridicules the philosophers from
      the standpoint of a materialist, without himself
      realising that his standpoint is that of a materialist!
    

The impotent wrath aroused in the philosophers by this almighty
      materialism is comprehensible. We quoted above the opinion of
      the “true-Russian” Lopatin. And here is the opinion
      of Mr. Rudolf Willy, the most progressive of the
      “empirio-criticists,” who is irreconcilably hostile
      to idealism (don’t laugh!). “Haeckel’s monism
      is a very heterogeneous mixture: it unites certain
      natural-scientific laws, such as the law of the conservation of
      energy . . . with certain scholastic traditions about substance
      and the thing-in-itself into a chaotic jumble” (Gegen
die Schulweisheit, S. 128).
    

What has annoyed this most worthy “recent
      positivist”? Well, how could he help being annoyed when he
      immediately realised that from Haeckel’s standpoint all
      the great doctrines of his teacher Avenarius—for instance,
      that the brain is not the organ of thought, that sensations are
      not images of the external world, that matter
      (“substance”) or “the thing-in-itself”
      is not an objective reality, and so

    

forth—are nothing but
      sheer idealist gibberish !? Haeckel did not say it in
      so many words because he did not concern himself with philosophy
      and was not acquainted with “empirio-criticism”
      as such. But Rudolf Willy could not help realising that
      a hundred thousand Haeckel readers meant as many people spitting
      in the face of the philosophy of Mach and
      Avenarius. Willy wipes his face in advance, in the Lopatin
      manner. For the essence of the arguments which
      Mr. Lopatin and Mr. Willy marshal against materialism in general
      and natural-scientific materialism in particular, is exactly the
      same in both. To us Marxists the difference between Mr. Lopatin
      and Messrs. Willy, Petzoldt, Mach and Co. is no greater than the
      difference between the Protestant theologians and the Catholic
      theologians.
    

The “war” on Haeckel has proven that this
      view of ours corresponds to objective reality,
      i.e., to the class nature of modern society and its
      class ideological tendencies.
    

Here is another little example. The Machian Kleinpeter has
      translated from English into German, under the title of Das
      Weltbild der modernen Naturwissenschaft

[World Picture from the Standpoint of Modern Natural Science]

(Leipzig, 1905), a work by Carl
      Snyder well known in America. This work gives a clear and
      popular account of a number of recent discoveries in physics and
      other branches of science. And the Machian Kleinpeter felt
      himself called upon to supply the book with a preface in which
      he makes certain reservations, such as, for example,
      that Snyder’s epistemology is “not
      satisfactory” (p. v). Why so? Because Snyder never
      entertains the slightest doubt that the world picture is a
      picture of how matter moves and of how “matter
      thinks” (p. 228). In his next book, The World
      Machine (London and New York, 1907), Snyder, referring to
      the fact that his book is dedicated to the memory of Democritus
      of Abdera, who lived about 460-360 B.C., says: “Democritus
      has often been styled the grandsire of materialism. It is a
      school of philosophy that is a little out of fashion nowadays;
      yet it is worthy of note that practically all of the modern
      advance in our ideas of this world has been grounded upon his
      conceptions. Practically speaking, materialistic assumptions are
      simply unescapable in physical investigations”
      (p. 140).
    
 

      “. . . If he like, he may dream with good Bishop Berkeley
      that it is all a dream. Yet comforting as may be the
      leger-demain of an idealised idealism, there are still few among
      us who, whatever they may think regarding the problem of the
      external world, doubt that they themselves exist; and it needs
      no long pursuit of the will-o’-the-wisps of the
      Ich and non-Ich to assure oneself that if in
      an unguarded moment we assume that we ourselves have a
      personality and a being, we let in the whole procession of
      appearances which come of the six gates of the senses. The
      nebular hypothesis, the light-bearing ether, the atomic theory,
      and all their like, may be but convenient ‘working
      hypotheses,’ but it is well to remember that, in the
      absence of negative proof, they stand on more or less the same
      footing as the hypothesis that a being you call
      ‘you,’ Oh, Indulgent Reader, scans these
      lines” (pp. 31-32).
    

Imagine the bitter lot of a Machian when his favourite subtle
      constructions, which reduce the categories of science to mere
      working hypotheses, are laughed at by the scientists on both
      sides of the ocean as sheer nonsense! Is it to be wondered that
      Rudolf Willy, in 1905, combats Democritus as though he
      were a living enemy, thereby providing an excellent illustration
      of the partisan character of philosophy and once more
      exposing the real position he himself takes up in this partisan
      struggle? He writes: “Of course, Democritus was not
      conscious of the fact that atoms and the void are only
      fictitious concepts which perform mere accessory services
      (blosse Handlangerdienste), and maintain their
      existence only by grace of expediency, just as long as they
      prove useful. Democritus was not free enough for this; but
      neither are our modern natural scientists, with few
      exceptions. The faith of old Democritus is the faith of our
      scientists” (op. cit., p. 57).
    

And there is good reason for despair! The
      “empirio-criticists” have proven in quite a
      “new way” that both space and atoms are
      “working hypotheses”; and yet the natural scientists
      deride this Berkeleianism and follow Haeckel. We are by
      no means idealists, this is a slander; we are only striving
      (together with the idealists) to refute the epistemological line
      of Democritus; we have been

    

striving to do so for more than
      2,000 years, but all in vain! And nothing better remains for our
      leader Ernst Mach to do than to dedicate his last work, the
      outcome of his life and philosophy, Erkenntnis und
      Irrtum, to Wilhelm Schuppe and to remark ruefully
      in the text that the majority of scientists are materialists and
      that “we also” sympathise with Haeckel
      . . . for his “freethinking” (p. 14).
    

And there he completely betrays himself, this ideologist of
      reactionary philistinism who follows the arch-reactionary
      Schuppe and “sympathises” with
      Haeckel’s freethinking. They are all like this, these
      humanitarian philistines in Europe, with their freedom-loving
      sympathies and their ideological (political and economic)
      captivity to the Wilhelm
Schuppes.[5]
[5]
Plekhanov
      in his criticism of Machism was less concerned with refuting
      Mach than with dealing a factional blow at Bolshevism. For this
      petty and miserable exploitation of fundamental theoretical
      differences, he has been already deservedly punished—with
      two books by Machian
Mensheviks.[9]
—Lenin


Non-partisanship in
philosophy is only wretchedly masked servility to idealism and
      fideism.
    

Let us, in conclusion, compare this with the opinion of Haeckel
      held by Franz Mehring, who not only wants to be, but who knows
      how to be a Marxist. The moment The Riddle of the
      Universe appeared, towards the end of 1899, Mehring pointed
      out that “Haeckel’s work, both in its less good and
      its very good aspects, is eminently adapted to help clarify the
      apparently rather confused views prevailing in the party as to
      the significance for it of historical materialism, on
      the one hand, and historical materialism, on the
      other.”[6]

      Haeckel’s defect is that he has not the slightest
      conception of historical materialism, which leads him
      to utter the most woeful nonsense about politics, about
      “monistic religion,” and so on and so
      forth. “Haeckel is a materialist and monist, not a
      historical but a natural-scientific materialist”
      (ibid.).
    

      “He who wants to perceive this inability

[of natural-scientific materialism to deal with
      social problems]

tangibly, he who wants to be convinced
      that natural-scientific materialism must be broadened into
      historical materialism

    

if it is really to be an invincible
      weapon in the great struggle for the liberation of mankind, let
      him read Haeckel’s book.
    

      “But let him not read it for this purpose alone! Its
      uncommonly weak side is inseparably bound up with its uncommonly
      strong side, viz., with the comprehensible and luminous
      description (which after all takes up by far the greater and
      more important part of the book) given by Haeckel of the
      development of the natural sciences in this [the 19th] century,
      or, in other words, of the triumphant march of
      natural-scientific
materialism.”[7]

## Conclusion









Lenin: 1908/mec: Conclusion







V. I.  

      Lenin
MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    

Conclusion

There are four
standpoints from which a Marxist must proceed to form a judgment
of empirio-criticism.


First and foremost, the theoretical foundations of this
philosophy must be compared with those of dialectical
materialism. Such a comparison, to which the first three
chapters were devoted, reveals, along the whole line
of epistemological problems, the thoroughly
reactionary character of empirio-criticism, which uses
new artifices, terms and subtleties to disguise the old errors
of idealism and agnosticism. Only utter ignorance of
the nature of philosophical materialism generally and of the
nature of Marx’s and Engels’ dialectical method can lead one
to speak of “combining” empirio-criticism and
Marxism.
      

Secondly, the place of empirio-criticism, as one very small
school of specialists in philosophy, in relation to the other
modern schools of philosophy must be determined. Both Mach and
Avenarius started with Kant and, leaving him, proceeded not
towards materialism, but in the opposite direction, towards
Hume and Berkeley. Imagining that he was “purifying
experience” generally, Avenarius was in fact only
purifying agnosticism of Kantianism. The whole school of Mach
and Avenarius is moving more and more definitely towards
idealism, hand in hand with one of the most reactionary of the
idealist schools, viz., the so-called immanentists.
      

Thirdly, the indubitable connection between Machism and one
school in one branch of modern science must be borne in
mind. The vast majority of scientists, both generally and in
this special branch of science in question, viz.,
physics, are invariably on the side of materialism.

    

A minority
of new physicists, however, influenced by the breakdown of old
theories brought about by the great discoveries of recent
years, influenced by the crisis in the new physics, which has
very clearly revealed the relativity of our knowledge, have,
owing to their ignorance of dialectics, slipped into idealism
by way of relativism. The physical idealism in vogue today is
as reactionary and transitory an infatuation as was the
fashionable physiological idealism of the recent past.
    

Fourthly, behind the epistemological scholasticism of
empirio-criticism one must not fail to see the struggle of
parties in philosophy, a struggle which in the last analysis
reflects the tendencies and ideology of the antagonistic
classes in modern society. Recent philosophy is as partisan as
was philosophy two thousand years ago. The contending parties
are essentially, although it is concealed by a pseudo-erudite
quackery of new terms or by a feeble-minded non-partisanship,
materialism and idealism. The latter is merely a subtle,
refined form of fideism, which stands fully armed, commands
vast organisations and steadily continues to exercise
influence on the masses, turning the slightest vacillation in
philosophical thought to its own advantage. The objective,
class role of empirio-criticism consists entirely in rendering
faithful service to the fideists in their struggle against
materialism in general and historical materialism in
particular.

## From What Angle Did
  N. G. Chernyshevsky Criticise Kantianism?









Lenin: 1908/mec: Supplement to Chapter Four, SECTION I 







V.I. Lenin
MATERIALISM and EMPIRIO-CRITICISM
Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy



    


Supplement to Chapter Four,
      SECTION I[1]
[2]

From What Angle Did N. G. Chernyshevsky Criticise Kantianism?


In the first section of Chapter IV we showed in detail that
the materialists have been criticising Kant from a standpoint
diametrically opposite to that from which Mach and Avenarius
criticise him. It would not be superfluous to add here, albeit
briefly, an indication of the epistemological position held by
the great Russian Hegelian and materialist,
N. G. Chernyshevsky.
      

Shortly after Albrecht Rau, the German disciple of Feuerbach,
had published his criticism of Kant, the great Russian writer
N. G. Chernyshevsky, who was also a disciple of Feuerbach,
first attempted an explicit statement of his attitude towards
both Feuerbach and Kant. N. G. Chernyshevsky had appeared in
Russian literature as a follower of Feuerbach as early as the
’fifties, but our censorship did not allow him even to mention
Feuerbach’s name. In 1888, in the preface to the projected
third edition of his The Aesthetic Relation of Art to
Reality, N. G. Chernyshevsky attempted to allude directly
to Feuerbach, but in 1888 too the censor refused to allow even
a mere reference to Feuerbach! It was not until 1906 that the
preface saw the light (see N. G. Chernyshevsky, Collected
Works, Vol. X, Part II, pp. 190-97). In this preface
N. G. Chernyshevsky devotes half a page to criticising Kant
and the scientists who follow Kant in their philosophical
conclusions.
      
 

Here is the excellent argument given by Chernyshevsky in 1888:
      

“Natural scientists who imagine themselves to be builders of
all-embracing theories are really disciples, and usually poor
disciples, of the ancient thinkers who evolved the
metaphysical systems, usually thinkers whose systems had
already been partially destroyed by Schelling and finally
destroyed by Hegel. One need only point out that the majority
of the natural scientists who endeavour to construct broad
theories of the laws of operation of human thought only repeat
Kant’s metaphysical theory regarding the subjectivity of our
knowledge. . . .”
(For the benefit of the Russian
Machians who manage to muddle everything, let us say that
Chernyshevsky is below Engels in so far as in his terminology
he confuses the opposition between materialism and idealism
with the opposition between metaphysical thought and
dialectical thought; but Chernyshevsky is entirely on Engels’
level in so far as he takes Kant to task not for realism, but
for agnosticism and subjectivism, not for recognition of the
“thing-in-itself,” but for inability to derive our
knowledge from this objective source.) “. . . they argue
from Kant’s words that the forms of our sense-perception have
no resemblance to the forms of the actual existence of
objects. . . .”
(For the benefit of the Russian Machians
who manage to muddle everything, let us say that
Chernyshevsky’s criticism of Kant is the diametrical opposite
of the criticism of Kant by Avenarius, Mach and the
immanentists, because for Chernyshevsky, as for every
materialist, the forms of our sense-perception do resemble the
form of the
actual—i.e. objectively-real—existence of
objects.) “. . . that, therefore, really existing
objects, their real qualities, and the real relations between
them are unknowable to us. . . .”
(For the benefit of
the Russian Machians who manage to muddle everything, let us
say that for Chernyshevsky, as for every materialist, objects,
or to use Kant’s ornate language,
“things-in-themselves,” really exist and
are fully knowable to us, knowable in their
existence, their qualities and the real relations between
them.) “. . . and if they were knowable they could not
be the object of our thought, which shapes all the material of
knowledge into forms totally different from the forms of

    

actual existence, that, moreover, the very laws of thought
have only a subjective significance. . . .”
(For the
benefit of the Machian muddlers, let us say that for
Chernyshevsky, as for every materialist, the laws of thought
have not merely a subjective significance; in other words, the
laws of thought reflect the forms of actual existence of
objects, fully resemble, and do not differ from, these forms.)
“. . . that in reality there is nothing corresponding
to what appears to us to be the connection of cause and
effect, for there is neither antecedent nor subsequent,
neither whole nor parts, and so on and so forth. . . .”
(For the benefit of the Machian muddlers, let us say that for
Chernyshevsky, as for every materialist, there does exist in
reality what appears to us to be the connection between cause
and effect, there is objective causality or natural
necessity.) “. . . When natural scientists stop uttering
such and similar metaphysical nonsense, they will be capable
of working out, and probably will work out, on the basis of
science, a system of concepts more exact and complete than
those propounded by Feuerbach. . . .”
(For the benefit
of the Machian muddlers, let us say that Chernyshevsky regards
as metaphysical nonsense all deviations from
materialism, both in the direction of idealism and in the
direction of agnosticism.) “. . . But meanwhile, the
best statement of the scientific concepts of the so-called
fundamental problems of man’s inquisitiveness remains that
made by Feuerbach” (pp. 195–96). By the fundamental
problems of man’s inquisitiveness Chernyshevsky means what in
modern language are known as the fundamental problems of the
theory of knowledge, or epistemology. Chernyshevsky is the
only really great Russian writer who, from the ’fifties until
1888, was able to keep on the level of an integral
philosophical materialism and who spurned the wretched
nonsense of the Neo-Kantians, positivists, Machians and other
muddleheads. But Chernyshevsky did not succeed in rising, or,
rather, owing to the backwardness of Russian life, was unable
to rise, to the level of the dialectical materialism of Marx
and Engels.

The manuscript of the “Supplement to Chapter Four, Section 1,
‘From What Angle Did N. G. Chernyshevsky Criticise Kantianism?’\thinspace”
was sent by Lenin to A. I. Ulyanova-Yelizarova in the second half of March,
when the book was already in the press.  In a letter to his sister dated
March 10 or 11 (23 or 24), 1909, Lenin wrote in reference to this
supplement: “I am sending you a supplement. It is not worth while delaying
on account of it. But if there is time, put it at the end of the book,
after the conclusion, in small print, for instance. I regard it as
extremely important to counterpose ‘Chernyshevsky’ to the Machists.”
